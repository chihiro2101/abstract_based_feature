zimbabwe is the shona name of the ruins , first recorded in 1531 by vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala the first proposes that the word is derived from , translated from the karanga dialect of shona as '' large houses of stone '' plural of , '' house '' ; plural of , '' stone '' ) . see also a second suggests that zimbabwe is a contracted form of , which means '' venerated houses '' in the zezuru dialect of shona , as usually applied to the houses or graves of chiefs image : great-zimbabwe.jpg right thumb overview of great zimbabwe the majority of scholars believe that it was built by members of the gokomere culture , who were the ancestors of the modern shona in zimbabwe the great zimbabwe area was settled by the fourth century ad between the fourth and the seventh centuries , communities of the gokomere or ziwa cultures farmed the valley , and mined and worked iron , but built no stone structures the ruins at great zimbabwe are some of the oldest and largest structures located in southern africa , and are the second oldest after nearby mapungubwe in south africa david beach believes that the city and its state , the kingdom of zimbabwe , flourished from 1200 to 1500 , although a somewhat earlier date for its demise is implied by a description transmitted in the early 1500s to joão de barros its growth has been linked to the decline of mapungubwe from around 1300 , due to climatic change or the greater availability of gold in the hinterland of great zimbabwe traditional estimates are that great zimbabwe had as many as 18,000 inhabitants at its peak in 1531 , vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala , described zimbabwe thus : the ruins form three distinct architectural groups they are known as the hill complex , the valley complex and the great enclosure notable features of the hill complex include the eastern enclosure , in which it is thought the zimbabwe birds stood , a high balcony enclosure overlooking the eastern enclosure , and a huge boulder in a shape similar to that of the zimbabwe bird these were carved from a micaceous schist ( soapstone ) on the tops of monoliths the height of a person garlake ( 2002 ) 158 slots in a platform in the eastern enclosure of the hill complex appear designed to hold the monoliths with the zimbabwe birds , but as they were not found in situ it can not be determined which monolith and bird were where garlake ( 2002 ) 159–162 summers ( 1970 ) p166 glass beads and porcelain from china and persia among other foreign artefacts were also found , attesting the international trade linkages of the kingdom in the extensive stone ruins of the great city , which still remain today , include eight , monolithic birds carved in soapstone despite these strong international trade links , there is no evidence to suggest exchange of architectural concepts between great zimbabwe and centres such as kilwa causes for the decline and ultimate abandonment of the site around 1450 have been suggested as due to a decline in trade compared to sites further north , the exhaustion of the gold mines , political instability and famine and water shortages induced by climatic change 738 portuguese traders heard about the remains of the ancient city in the early 16th century , and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them , linking great zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade in 1506 , the explorer diogo de alcáçova described the edifices in a letter to the then king of portugal , writing that they were part of the larger kingdom of ucalanga ( presumably karanga , a dialect of the shona people spoken mainly in masvingo and midlands provinces of zimbabwe ) joão de barros left another such description of great zimbabwe in 1538 , as recounted to him by moors traders who had visited the area and possessed knowledge of the hinterland he indicates that the edifices were locally known as symbaoe , which meant '' royal court '' in the vernacular as to the actual identity of the builders of great zimbabwe , de barros writes : additionally , with regard to the purpose of the great zimbabwe ruins , de barros asserted that : '' in the opinion of the moors who saw it great zimbabwe it is very ancient and was built to keep possessions of the mines , which are very old , and no gold has been extracted from them for years , because of the wars '' thus , great zimbabwe appears to have still been inhabited as recently as the early 16th century the ruins were rediscovered during a hunting trip in 1867 by adam render , a german-american hunter , prospector and trader in southern africa , who in 1871 showed the ruins to karl mauch , a german explorer and geographer of africa karl mauch recorded the ruins 3 september 1871 , and immediately speculated about a possible biblical association with king solomon and the queen of sheba , an explanation which had been suggested by earlier writers such as the portuguese joão dos santos pikirayi ( 2001 ) p9 the sheba legend , as promoted by mauch , became so pervasive in the white settler community as to cause the later scholar james theodore bent to say , 1550 bc–1077 bc ) , if not a relic of an old egyptian station near the local gold mines swan ( 1858-1904 ) , who also visited and surveyed a host of related stone ruins nearby however ,

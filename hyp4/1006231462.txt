zimbabwe is the shona name of the ruins , first recorded in 1531 by vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala the first proposes that the word is derived from , translated from the karanga dialect of shona as '' large houses of stone '' plural of , '' house '' ; plural of , '' stone '' ) . see also a second suggests that zimbabwe is a contracted form of , which means '' venerated houses '' in the zezuru dialect of shona , as usually applied to the houses or graves of chiefs image : great-zimbabwe.jpg right thumb overview of great zimbabwe the majority of scholars believe that it was built by members of the gokomere culture , who were the ancestors of the modern shona in zimbabwe the great zimbabwe area was settled by the fourth century ad between the fourth and the seventh centuries , communities of the gokomere or ziwa cultures farmed the valley , and mined and worked iron , but built no stone structures the ruins at great zimbabwe are some of the oldest and largest structures located in southern africa , and are the second oldest after nearby mapungubwe in south africa its most formidable edifice , commonly referred to as the great enclosure , has walls as high as extending approximately , making it the largest ancient structure south of the sahara desert its growth has been linked to the decline of mapungubwe from around 1300 , due to climatic change or the greater availability of gold in the hinterland of great zimbabwe in 1531 , vicente pegado , captain of the portuguese garrison of sofala , described zimbabwe thus : the ruins form three distinct architectural groups they are known as the hill complex , the valley complex and the great enclosure the great enclosure was occupied from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries , and the valley complex from the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries notable features of the hill complex include the eastern enclosure , in which it is thought the zimbabwe birds stood , a high balcony enclosure overlooking the eastern enclosure , and a huge boulder in a shape similar to that of the zimbabwe bird garlake ( 1973 ) 27 the great enclosure is composed of an inner wall , encircling a series of structures and a younger outer wall garlake ( 1973 ) 29 the valley complex is divided into the upper and lower valley ruins , with different periods of occupation the focus of power moved from the hill complex in the twelfth century , to the great enclosure , the upper valley and finally the lower valley in the early sixteenth century structures that were more elaborate were probably built for the kings , although it has been argued that the dating of finds in the complexes does not support this interpretation thumb the most important artefacts recovered from the monument are the eight zimbabwe birds these were carved from a micaceous schist ( soapstone ) on the tops of monoliths the height of a person garlake ( 2002 ) 158 slots in a platform in the eastern enclosure of the hill complex appear designed to hold the monoliths with the zimbabwe birds , but as they were not found in situ it can not be determined which monolith and bird were where garlake ( 2002 ) 159–162 summers ( 1970 ) p166 glass beads and porcelain from china and persia among other foreign artefacts were also found , attesting the international trade linkages of the kingdom in the extensive stone ruins of the great city , which still remain today , include eight , monolithic birds carved in soapstone it is thought that they represent the bateleur eagle- a good omen , protective spirit and messenger of the gods in shona culture archaeological evidence suggests that great zimbabwe became a centre for trading , with artefacts suggesting that the city formed part of a trade network linked to kilwa garlake ( 2002 ) 184–185 and extending as far as china despite these strong international trade links , there is no evidence to suggest exchange of architectural concepts between great zimbabwe and centres such as kilwa the first european visit may have been made by the portuguese traveler antónio fernandes in 1513-1515 , who crossed twice and reported in detail the region of present-day zimbabwe ( including the shona kingdoms ) and also fortified centers in stone without mortar joão de barros left another such description of great zimbabwe in 1538 , as recounted to him by moors traders who had visited the area and possessed knowledge of the hinterland he indicates that the edifices were locally known as symbaoe , which meant '' royal court '' in the vernacular it would seem that some prince who has possession of these mines ordered it to be built as a sign thereof , which he afterwards lost in the course of time and through their being so remote from his kingdom '' thus , great zimbabwe appears to have still been inhabited as recently as the early 16th century some further test trenches were then put down outside the lower great enclosure and in the valley ruins , which unearthed domestic ironwork , glass beads , and a gold bracelet who have worked on the chronology and development of great zimbabwe and gilbert pwiti , who has published extensively on trade links when white colonialists like cecil rhodes first saw the ruins , they saw them as a sign of the great riches that the area would yield to its new masters a tower of the great zimbabwe is also depicted on the coat of arms of zimbabwe

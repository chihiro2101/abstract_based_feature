prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers ( i.e more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein this prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane the prenylation motif “ caax box ” is the most common prenylation site in proteins , that is , the site where farnesyl or geranylgeranyl covalently attach furthermore , protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer the most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic ( 14-carbon ) acid and palmitic acid ( 16-carbon ) attachment of myristic acid ) is generally an irreversible protein modification that typically occurs during protein synthesis in which the myrisitc acid is attached to the α-amino group of an n-terminal glycine residue through an amide linkage attachment of palmitic acid ) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( gpi-anchored proteins ) are attached to a gpi complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein 's c-terminus carboxyl group the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane

prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers ( i.e more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein this prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane the prenylation motif “ caax box ” is the most common prenylation site in proteins , that is , the site where farnesyl or geranylgeranyl covalently attach furthermore , protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues after the protein bh3 interacting-domain death agonist ( bid ) has been myristoylated , it targets the protein to move to the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c , which then ultimately leads to cell death palmitoylated proteins are mainly found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane where they play a role in transmembrane signaling the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane these proteins are only located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane

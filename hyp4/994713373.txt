prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers ( i.e more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein this prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane if the x is an ala , met , ser or gln the protein will be farnesylated via the farnesyltransferase enzyme and if the x is a leu then the protein will be geranylgeranylated via the geranylgeranyltransferase i enzyme furthermore , protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues the most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic ( 14-carbon ) acid and palmitic acid ( 16-carbon ) after the protein bh3 interacting-domain death agonist ( bid ) has been myristoylated , it targets the protein to move to the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c , which then ultimately leads to cell death it is believed that this reverse palmitoylation may regulate the interaction of the protein with the membrane and thus have a role in signaling processes glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( gpi-anchored proteins ) are attached to a gpi complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein 's c-terminus carboxyl group the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane

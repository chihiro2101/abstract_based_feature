prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers ( i.e more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein this prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane the prenylation motif “ caax box ” is the most common prenylation site in proteins , that is , the site where farnesyl or geranylgeranyl covalently attach furthermore , protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer more specifically , ras is the protein that undergoes prenylation via farnesyltransferase and when it is switched on it can turn on genes involved in cell growth and differentiation fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues attachment of palmitic acid ) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage palmitoylation mediates the affinity of a protein for lipid rafts and facilitates the clustering of proteins the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane

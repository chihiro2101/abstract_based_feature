prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers ( i.e more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein this prenylation of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane furthermore , protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane this dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues the most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic ( 14-carbon ) acid and palmitic acid ( 16-carbon ) proteins that have been myristoylated are involved in signal transduction cascade , protein-protein interactions and in mechanisms that regulate protein targeting and function attachment of palmitic acid ) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane more specifically , the gpi protein izumo1r/juno ( named after the juno ( mythology ) ) on the egg plasma has an essential role in fertilisation

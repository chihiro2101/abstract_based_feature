prenylated proteins are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers ( i.e more specifically , these isoprenoid groups , usually farnesyl ( 15-carbon ) and geranylgeranyl ( 20-carbon ) are attached to the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the c terminal of the protein furthermore , protein prenylation is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane more specifically , ras is the protein that undergoes prenylation via farnesyltransferase and when it is switched on it can turn on genes involved in cell growth and differentiation fatty acylated proteins are proteins that have been post-translationally modified to include the covalent attachment of fatty acids at certain amino acid residues the most common fatty acids that are covalently attached to the protein are the saturated myristic ( 14-carbon ) acid and palmitic acid ( 16-carbon ) attachment of myristic acid ) is generally an irreversible protein modification that typically occurs during protein synthesis in which the myrisitc acid is attached to the Î±-amino group of an n-terminal glycine residue through an amide linkage attachment of palmitic acid ) is a reversible protein modification in which a palmitic acid is attached to a specific cysteine residue via thioester linkage an example in which palmitoylation of a protein plays a role in cell signaling pathways is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( gpi-anchored proteins ) are attached to a gpi complex molecular group via an amide linkage to the protein 's c-terminus carboxyl group the fatty acid chains of the phosphatidylinositol are inserted into the membrane and thus are what anchor the protein to the membrane

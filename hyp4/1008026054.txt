leathers are one-piece suits or two-piece jackets and trousers worn by motorcyclists , mainly for protection in a crash in most cases , the type of leather used is not fashion leather but protective leather , which is thicker , stronger , and only moderately flexible not all leathers used in garments perform equally ; products made from full grain , top grain , corrected grain , and suede can have different levels of resistance to abrasion , as well as tearing and bursting forces leather suits were the first motorcyclists ' garments to be tested using the cambridge impact abrasion tester , woods , r 1996 belt abrader impact abrasion testing of leathers and fabrics used in motorcycle riders ' clothing 57-69 some leather products available have been certified as meeting the european standard en 13595-1:2002 leather chaps , adapted from cowboy gear , were used by american bikers starting in the early 1960s the one-piece racing leather suit , usually referred to as 'racing leathers ' , was first used by world champion motorcycle racer geoff duke in the 1950s duke had the suit made for the purposes of streamlining , not safety , and like the majority of the leathers used at the time , was made from horsehide motorcycle garments must have armour on the inside at major impact regions such as shoulders , elbows , hips ( with the exception of class a or b ) and knees the european standards for these protectors are en 1621-1:2012 , en 1621-2:2014 and en 1621-3:2018 ce-marked armor comes in two levels , with level 2 providing greater protection dr roderick woods at cambridge university led the work on which the ce standard is based two italian manufacturers – allegedly concerned their armour would not pass the highest standard – successfully lobbied for level 3 to be removed these can offer improved weather protection from heat , cold , and water , and the increased utility these garments tend to provide in terms of pockets and vents in both ce marked ( meets european standards ) and non-protective garments , localised protection may be provided by armour and airbag systems denim and heavyweight waxed cotton was used for many years before the development of modern materials tough , strong , moderately flexible boots with stiff soles provide the rider protection from a number of risks boots may also have energy absorbers and load spreaders on the shin , inside and outside of each ankle there is a european standard available for motorcycle boots , and it is a legal requirement in europe and the uk for these boots to be ce certified work by albanese et al ( 2017 ) could explain why : “ the allowable transmitted force of en 1621-1 may be too high to effectively reduce the probability of impact injury european standard en 13594:2015 is available for this purpose , with gloves certified to level 1 or level 2 en17092 abrasion resistance is carried out on a darmstadt impact abrasion machine rather than the previous cambridge abrasion machine also , the cambridge impact abrasion test is used by the motorcycle clothing assessment program ( motocap ) in australia and new zealand its safety ratings assess how well clothing protects a motorcyclist in a crash ( based on impact protection , burst resistance and abrasion resistance )

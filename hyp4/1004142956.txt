the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist there are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality : cannabidiol ( cbd ) , an isomer of thc ; cannabivarin ( cbv ) , an analog of cannabinol ( cbn ) with a different side chain , cannabidivarin ( cbdv ) , an analog of cbd with a different side chain , and cannabinolic acid thc is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-thc , which is also pharmacologically active , so the euphoria outlasts measurable thc levels in blood cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring , a variedly derivatized aromatic ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors , constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds like most other neurological processes , the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction , the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response most cannabinoids are lipophilic ( fat soluble ) compounds that are easily stored in fat , thus yielding a long elimination half-life relative to other recreational drugs a review published in the british journal of psychiatry in february 2001 said that '' no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported '' '' hospitals see rare vomiting syndrome in heavy marijuana consumers ) thc , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions a 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar , cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia , hydrogen cyanide , and nitrogen oxides , but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) than sidestream tobacco smoke however , other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco , and that some other constituents ( such as polonium-210 , lead , arsenic , nicotine , and tobacco-specific nitrosamines ) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke further , he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer , and accuses the blf of '' scaremongering over cannabis '' when smoked , the short-term effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent within a few minutes , typically lasting for 1â€“3 hours , varying by the person and the strain of cannabis after oral ingestion of cannabis , the onset of effect is delayed relative to smoking , taking 30 minutes to 2 hours , but the duration is prolonged due to continued slow absorption the duration of noticeable effects has been observed to diminish after prolonged , repeated use and the development of increased tolerance to cannabinoids the psychoactive effects of cannabis , known as a '' high '' , are subjective and vary among persons and the method of use cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience at higher doses , effects can include altered body image , auditory and/or visual illusions , pseudohallucinations , and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes any episode of acute psychosis that accompanies cannabis use usually abates after six hours , but in rare instances , heavy users may find the symptoms continuing for many days peak levels of cannabis-associated intoxication occur approximately 30 minutes after smoking it and last for several hours when taken orally ( in the form of capsules , food , or drink ) , the psychoactive effects take longer to manifest and generally last longer , typically lasting for an average of four to six hours after consumption oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore negates the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking while several studies have shown increased risk associated with cannabis use by drivers , other studies have not found increased risk in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired the observed effects on memory and learning , they said , showed long-term cannabis use caused '' selective memory defects '' , but that the impact was '' of a very small magnitude '' the feeling of increased appetite following the use of cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years , and is known colloquially as '' the munchies '' in the english-speaking world most microorganisms found in cannabis only affect plants and not humans , but some microorganisms , especially those that proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored , can be harmful to humans mold is also found in smoke from mold-infected cannabis , and the lungs and nasal passages are a major means of contracting fungal infections cannabis dependence is defined in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) as a condition requiring treatment

the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist there are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality : cannabidiol ( cbd ) , an isomer of thc ; cannabivarin ( cbv ) , an analog of cannabinol ( cbn ) with a different side chain , cannabidivarin ( cbdv ) , an analog of cbd with a different side chain , and cannabinolic acid thc is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-thc , which is also pharmacologically active , so the euphoria outlasts measurable thc levels in blood the thc molecule , and related compounds , are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to redwood laboratories ; long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use ( see drug test ) a review published in the british journal of psychiatry in february 2001 said that '' no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported '' it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions a review thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking a 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar , cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia , hydrogen cyanide , and nitrogen oxides , but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) than sidestream tobacco smoke a study by the british lung foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco when smoked , the short-term effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent within a few minutes , typically lasting for 1â€“3 hours , varying by the person and the strain of cannabis after oral ingestion of cannabis , the onset of effect is delayed relative to smoking , taking 30 minutes to 2 hours , but the duration is prolonged due to continued slow absorption the duration of noticeable effects has been observed to diminish after prolonged , repeated use and the development of increased tolerance to cannabinoids the psychoactive effects of cannabis , known as a '' high '' , are subjective and vary among persons and the method of use the endogenous ligand of these receptors is anandamide , the effects of which thc emulates this agonist of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters , especially dopamine and norepinephrine ; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion , such as euphoria and anxiety between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis ; however , some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience cannabis produces many other subjective effects , including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma , and marked cannabis and time perception ( where experiencing a '' rush '' of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing ) while psychoactive drugs are typically categorized as stimulant , depressant , or hallucinogen , cannabis exhibits a mix of all of them , perhaps leaning more towards hallucinogenic or psychedelic properties , though with other effects quite pronounced thc is considered the primary active component of the cannabis plant some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate , dry mouth , reddening of the eyes ( congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels ) , a reduction in intra-ocular pressure , muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore negates the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking while several studies have shown increased risk associated with cannabis use by drivers , other studies have not found increased risk an extensive 2013 review of 66 studies regarding crash risk and drug use found that cannabis was associated with minor , but not statistically significant increased odds of injury or fatal accident department of transportation 's national highway traffic safety administration , it was found that other '' studies that measure the presence of thc in the drivers ' blood or oral fluid , rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower ( or no ) elevated crash risk estimates the study found that '' after adjusting for age , gender , race and alcohol use , drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving '' data from the australian national survey of mental health and wellbeing found that three-quarters of recent cannabis users reported using alcohol when cannabis was not available , this suggests that the two are substitutes cannabis dependence is defined in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) as a condition requiring treatment the national cannabis prevention and information centre ( australia ) eu research paper on the potency of cannabis ( 2004 ) cannabis and mental health information leaflet from mental health charity the royal college of psychiatrists

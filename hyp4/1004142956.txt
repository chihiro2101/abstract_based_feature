the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist like most other neurological processes , the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction , the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response the thc molecule , and related compounds , are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to redwood laboratories ; long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use ( see drug test ) a review published in the british journal of psychiatry in february 2001 said that '' no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported '' '' hospitals see rare vomiting syndrome in heavy marijuana consumers ) thc , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions a review thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking a 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar , cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia , hydrogen cyanide , and nitrogen oxides , but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) than sidestream tobacco smoke a study by the british lung foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco professor david nutt , a uk drug expert , points out that the study cited by the british lung foundation has been accused of both '' false reasoning '' and '' incorrect methodology '' further , he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer , and accuses the blf of '' scaremongering over cannabis '' when smoked , the short-term effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent within a few minutes , typically lasting for 1–3 hours , varying by the person and the strain of cannabis after oral ingestion of cannabis , the onset of effect is delayed relative to smoking , taking 30 minutes to 2 hours , but the duration is prolonged due to continued slow absorption this agonist of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters , especially dopamine and norepinephrine ; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion , such as euphoria and anxiety between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis ; however , some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience cannabis produces many other subjective effects , including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma , and marked cannabis and time perception ( where experiencing a '' rush '' of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing ) in some cases , cannabis can lead to acute psychosis and dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization any episode of acute psychosis that accompanies cannabis use usually abates after six hours , but in rare instances , heavy users may find the symptoms continuing for many days some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate , dry mouth , reddening of the eyes ( congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels ) , a reduction in intra-ocular pressure , muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face peak levels of cannabis-associated intoxication occur approximately 30 minutes after smoking it and last for several hours the total short-term duration of cannabis use when smoked depends on the potency , method of smoking – e.g oral ingestion use eliminates the need to inhale toxic combustion products created by smoking and therefore negates the risk of respiratory harm associated with cannabis smoking in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired department of transportation 's national highway traffic safety administration , it was found that other '' studies that measure the presence of thc in the drivers ' blood or oral fluid , rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower ( or no ) elevated crash risk estimates the study found that '' after adjusting for age , gender , race and alcohol use , drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving '' data from the australian national survey of mental health and wellbeing found that three-quarters of recent cannabis users reported using alcohol when cannabis was not available , this suggests that the two are substitutes researchers from the university of california , san diego school of medicine failed to show substantial , systemic neurological effects from long-term recreational use of cannabis ( 2003 ) , adverse health consequences of cannabis use , a survey of scientific studies published up to and including the autumn of 2003 , national institute of public health , sweden , stockholm

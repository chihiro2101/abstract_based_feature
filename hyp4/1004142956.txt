the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist there are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality : cannabidiol ( cbd ) , an isomer of thc ; cannabivarin ( cbv ) , an analog of cannabinol ( cbn ) with a different side chain , cannabidivarin ( cbdv ) , an analog of cbd with a different side chain , and cannabinolic acid cbd is believed to regulate the metabolism of thc by inactivating cytochrome p450 enzymes that metabolize drugs thc is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-thc , which is also pharmacologically active , so the euphoria outlasts measurable thc levels in blood cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring , a variedly derivatized aromatic ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors , constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds like most other neurological processes , the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction , the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response it is now understood that cannabinoid receptors appear in similar forms in most vertebrates and invertebrates and have a long evolutionary biology of 500 million years a review published in the british journal of psychiatry in february 2001 said that '' no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported '' '' hospitals see rare vomiting syndrome in heavy marijuana consumers ) thc , the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant , has an extremely low toxicity and the amount that can enter the body through the consumption of cannabis plants poses no threat of death it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) than sidestream tobacco smoke however , other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco , and that some other constituents ( such as polonium-210 , lead , arsenic , nicotine , and tobacco-specific nitrosamines ) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke a study by the british lung foundation published in 2012 identifies cannabis smoke as a carcinogen and also finds awareness of the danger is low compared with the high awareness of the dangers of smoking tobacco particularly among younger users other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco further , he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer , and accuses the blf of '' scaremongering over cannabis '' the duration of noticeable effects has been observed to diminish after prolonged , repeated use and the development of increased tolerance to cannabinoids between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis ; however , some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time cannabis produces many other subjective effects , including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma , and marked cannabis and time perception ( where experiencing a '' rush '' of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing ) in some cases , cannabis can lead to acute psychosis and dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization any episode of acute psychosis that accompanies cannabis use usually abates after six hours , but in rare instances , heavy users may find the symptoms continuing for many days research have suggested that other cannabinoids like cbd may also play a significant role in its psychoactive effects some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate , dry mouth , reddening of the eyes ( congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels ) , a reduction in intra-ocular pressure , muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face the total short-term duration of cannabis use when smoked depends on the potency , method of smoking â€“ e.g the british medical journal indicated that '' drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol '' in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired in a review of driving simulator studies , researchers note that '' even in those who learn to compensate for a drug 's impairing effects , substantial impairment in performance can still be observed under conditions of general task performance ( i.e '' a 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash 95 % of cannabis users also drank alcohol ; 26 % took amphetamines ; 19 % took ecstasy and only 2.7 % reported not having used any other drug with cannabis cannabis dependence is defined in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) as a condition requiring treatment ( 2003 ) , adverse health consequences of cannabis use , a survey of scientific studies published up to and including the autumn of 2003 , national institute of public health , sweden , stockholm the national cannabis prevention and information centre ( australia ) eu research paper on the potency of cannabis ( 2004 ) cannabis and mental health information leaflet from mental health charity the royal college of psychiatrists

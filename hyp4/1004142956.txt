the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist cbd is believed to regulate the metabolism of thc by inactivating cytochrome p450 enzymes that metabolize drugs thc is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-thc , which is also pharmacologically active , so the euphoria outlasts measurable thc levels in blood cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring , a variedly derivatized aromatic ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors , constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds like most other neurological processes , the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction , the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response it is now understood that cannabinoid receptors appear in similar forms in most vertebrates and invertebrates and have a long evolutionary biology of 500 million years a review published in the british journal of psychiatry in february 2001 said that '' no deaths directly due to acute cannabis use have ever been reported '' a review thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking this study found that directly inhaled cannabis smoke contained as much as 20 times as much ammonia and 5 times as much hydrogen cyanide as tobacco smoke and compared the properties of both mainstream and sidestream ( smoke emitted from a smouldering 'joint ' or 'cone ' ) smoke mainstream cannabis smoke was found to contain higher concentrations of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) than sidestream tobacco smoke however , other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco , and that some other constituents ( such as polonium-210 , lead , arsenic , nicotine , and tobacco-specific nitrosamines ) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco further , he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer , and accuses the blf of '' scaremongering over cannabis '' after oral ingestion of cannabis , the onset of effect is delayed relative to smoking , taking 30 minutes to 2 hours , but the duration is prolonged due to continued slow absorption this agonist of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters , especially dopamine and norepinephrine ; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion , such as euphoria and anxiety abstract or philosophical thinking , disruption of linear memory and paranoia or anxiety are also typical between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis ; however , some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience cannabis produces many other subjective effects , including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma , and marked cannabis and time perception ( where experiencing a '' rush '' of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing ) at higher doses , effects can include altered body image , auditory and/or visual illusions , pseudohallucinations , and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes in some cases , cannabis can lead to acute psychosis and dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization while psychoactive drugs are typically categorized as stimulant , depressant , or hallucinogen , cannabis exhibits a mix of all of them , perhaps leaning more towards hallucinogenic or psychedelic properties , though with other effects quite pronounced cannabinoids produce a '' marked depression of motor activity '' via activation of neuronal cannabinoid receptors belonging to the cb1 subtype the total short-term duration of cannabis use when smoked depends on the potency , method of smoking â€“ e.g cannabis usage has been shown in some studies to have a negative effect on driving ability the british medical journal indicated that '' drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol '' short-term ( one to two hours ) effects on the cardiovascular system can include increased heart rate , dilation of blood vessels , and fluctuations in blood pressure such complications demonstrate the need for studies on cannabis that have stronger controls , and investigations into alleged symptoms of cannabis use that may also be caused by tobacco researchers from the university of california , san diego school of medicine failed to show substantial , systemic neurological effects from long-term recreational use of cannabis cannabis dependence is defined in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) as a condition requiring treatment cannabis consumption in pregnancy might be associated with restrictions in growth of the fetus , miscarriage , and cognitive deficits in offspring based on animal studies , although there is limited evidence for this in humans at this time

the most prevalent psychoactive substances in cannabis are cannabinoids , particularly thc some varieties , having undergone careful selection and growing techniques , can yield as much as 34 % thc another psychoactive cannabinoid present in cannabis sativa is tetrahydrocannabivarin ( thcv ) , but it is only found in small amounts and is a cannabinoid antagonist there are similar compounds in cannabis that do not exhibit psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality : cannabidiol ( cbd ) , an isomer of thc ; cannabivarin ( cbv ) , an analog of cannabinol ( cbn ) with a different side chain , cannabidivarin ( cbdv ) , an analog of cbd with a different side chain , and cannabinolic acid cannabinoids usually contain a 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring , a variedly derivatized aromatic ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors , constituting a family of about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds like most other neurological processes , the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction , the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a biological response the binding of cannabinoids to cannabinoid receptors decrease adenylyl cyclase activity , inhibit calcium n channels , and disinhibit potassium channel the thc molecule , and related compounds , are usually detectable in drug tests from 3 days up to 10 days according to redwood laboratories ; long-term users can produce positive tests for two to three months after ceasing cannabis use ( see drug test ) it is important though to note that cannabinoids and other molecules present in cannabis can alter the metabolism of other drugs , especially due to competition for clearing metabolic pathways such as cytochromes cyp450 , cannabinoids and cytochrome p450 interactions a review thus leading to drug toxicities by medications that the person consuming cannabis may be taking a 2007 study found that while tobacco and cannabis smoke are quite similar , cannabis smoke contained higher amounts of ammonia , hydrogen cyanide , and nitrogen oxides , but lower levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) however , other studies have found much lower disparities in ammonia and hydrogen cyanide between cannabis and tobacco , and that some other constituents ( such as polonium-210 , lead , arsenic , nicotine , and tobacco-specific nitrosamines ) are either lower or non-existent in cannabis smoke other observations include possible increased risk from each cigarette ; lack of research on the effect of cannabis smoke alone ; low rate of addiction compared to tobacco ; and episodic nature of cannabis use compared to steady frequent smoking of tobacco further , he notes that other studies have failed to connect cannabis with lung cancer , and accuses the blf of '' scaremongering over cannabis '' the psychoactive effects of cannabis , known as a '' high '' , are subjective and vary among persons and the method of use this agonist of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters , especially dopamine and norepinephrine ; neurotransmitters which are closely associated with the acute effects of cannabis ingestion , such as euphoria and anxiety between 20 and 30 percent of recreational users experience intense anxiety and/or panic attacks after smoking cannabis ; however , some report anxiety only after not smoking cannabis for a prolonged period of time cannabidiol ( cbd ) , another cannabinoid found in cannabis in varying amounts , has been shown to ameliorate the adverse effects of thc , including anxiety , that some consumers experience cannabis produces many other subjective effects , including an increased enjoyment of food taste and aroma , and marked cannabis and time perception ( where experiencing a '' rush '' of ideas can create the subjective impression of much time passing ) while psychoactive drugs are typically categorized as stimulant , depressant , or hallucinogen , cannabis exhibits a mix of all of them , perhaps leaning more towards hallucinogenic or psychedelic properties , though with other effects quite pronounced some of the short-term physical effects of cannabis use include increased heart rate , dry mouth , reddening of the eyes ( congestion of the conjunctival blood vessels ) , a reduction in intra-ocular pressure , muscle relaxation and a sensation of cold or hot hands and feet and / or flushed face cannabis usage has been shown in some studies to have a negative effect on driving ability the british medical journal indicated that '' drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol '' in cannabis and driving : a review of the literature and commentary , the united kingdom 's department for transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving , finding although impaired , '' subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired '' a 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash department of transportation 's national highway traffic safety administration , it was found that other '' studies that measure the presence of thc in the drivers ' blood or oral fluid , rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower ( or no ) elevated crash risk estimates the study found that '' after adjusting for age , gender , race and alcohol use , drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving '' marijuana 's cardiovascular effects are not associated with serious health problems for most young , healthy users 95 % of cannabis users also drank alcohol ; 26 % took amphetamines ; 19 % took ecstasy and only 2.7 % reported not having used any other drug with cannabis in a 2001 study looking at neuropsychological performance in long-term cannabis users , researchers found '' some cognitive deficits appear detectable at least 7 days after heavy cannabis use but appear reversible and related to recent cannabis exposure rather than irreversible and related to cumulative lifetime use '' the feeling of increased appetite following the use of cannabis has been documented for hundreds of years , and is known colloquially as '' the munchies '' in the english-speaking world cannabis dependence is defined in the fifth revision of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dsm-5 ) as a condition requiring treatment

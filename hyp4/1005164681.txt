in the 1160s , henry ii began to alter his policy of indirect rule in brittany and to exert more direct control henry had been at war with conan iv , duke of brittany local breton nobles rebelled against conan , so conan sought henry ii 's help henry then forced conan to abdicate as duke and to give brittany to his five-year-old daughter , constance , who was handed over and betrothed to henry 's son geoffrey henry responded by attacking chaumont-sur-epte , where louis kept his main military arsenal , burning the town to the ground and forcing louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in brittany , where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high geoffrey was fifteen years old when he joined the first revolt against his father geoffrey was a good friend of louis vii 's son philip , and the two men were frequently in alliance against king henry there is evidence to suggest that geoffrey was planning another rebellion with philip 's help during his final period in paris in the summer of 1186 as a participant in so many rebellions against his father , geoffrey acquired a reputation for treachery geoffrey and constance had three children , one born after geoffrey 's death : eleanor , fair maid of brittany ( 1184–1241 ) maud/matilda of brittany ( 1185–before may 1189 ) arthur i , duke of brittany ( 1187–1203 ? )

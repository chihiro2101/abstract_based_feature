princess ramavo was born in 1778 at the royal residence at ambatomanoina , campbell ( 2012 ) , p 375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir he furthermore declared that any child from this union would be first in the line of succession after radama despite her elevated rank among the royal wives , ramavo was not the preferred wife of radama and did not bear him any children upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage , the neglected ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with david griffiths and his fellow missionaries in griffiths ' home these visits established a deep friendship between ramavo and griffiths that endured for three decades when radama died without leaving any descendants on july 27 , 1828 , according to local custom the rightful heir was rakotobe , the eldest son of radama 's eldest sister an intelligent and amiable young man , rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the london missionary society in antananarivo on the grounds of the royal palace however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama & nbsp ; 42–45 during this time , another courtier , a high-ranking military officer named andriamamba , discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – andriamihaja , rainijohary and ravalontsalama – to support ramavo 's claim to the throne the officers then rallied the army behind ramavo , so that on august 11 , 1828 , when she declared herself the successor to radama on the pretence that he himself had decreed it , there could be no immediate resistance 421–422 by succeeding her husband , ranavalona became the first female sovereign of the merina kingdom since its founding in 1540 in the traditional culture of imerina , rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar these policies were enacted in a context of increasing european influence within her kingdom and competing european bids for domination over the island in 1835 she forbade the practice of christianity among the malagasy population , and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory putting an end to most foreign trade relationships , the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance , made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of corvée—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods in the tradition of many of her list of malagasy monarchs , l'habitation à madagascar ( 1898 ) , pp the residence was made entirely from wood and bore most of the features of a traditional home of the merina andriana ( aristocratic class ) , including a central pillar ( andry ) to support the roof 427 in many respects , ranavalona 's rule was a continuation of precedent established under radama i ranavalona maintained the tradition of ruling with the support of advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class her first chief adviser was a young army officer from namehana named andriamihaja , who served as first minister from 1829 to 1830 major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i the conservative faction conspired to reduce andriamahaja 's progressive influence over the queen , and in september 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason 14 following andriamihaja 's death , the influence of radama 's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court , who grew ever closer to the queen , eventually resulting in ranavalona 's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead field marshal rainiharo ( also called ravoninahitriniarivo ) of ilafy in 1833 upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 traditionally , merina sovereigns relied on the pronouncement of kabary ( oratory ) in public gatherings to communicate policy and reaffirm the relationship between sovereign and public due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics , ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes ranavalona innovated on these traditional rituals by increasing their complexity and symbolism to imbue them with added significance fanompoana labor among the population of imerina could include conscription into the military , enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers 25 this army , which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces , exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to merina domination approximately one million slaves entered imerina from coastal areas between 1820 and 1853 , constituting one-third of the total population in the central highlands and two-thirds of all residents in antananarivo a further 25–50 % of the queen 's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have died each year due to diseases such as malaria a poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena ( cerbera manghas ) shrub and ingested , with the outcome determining innocence or guilt residents of madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes , including theft , christianity and especially witchcraft , for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory the lms missionaries , capitalizing on the absence of legal decrees against their own work at the press , managed to continue independently printing and distributing materials the french , who held several small islands off madagascar , were interested in gaining control over the main island but this move was opposed by the british who had an interest in maintaining a secure passage to india ranavalona pursued a policy of self-reliance to limit the influence of foreign powers 11 the queen 's foreign contemporaries strongly condemned her policies and viewed them as the actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman , a characterization that persisted in western historical literature until the 1970s the majority , regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies , consider her a remarkable figure in malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with european powers

375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir despite her elevated rank among the royal wives , ramavo was not the preferred wife of radama and did not bear him any children upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship when radama died without leaving any descendants on july 27 , 1828 , according to local custom the rightful heir was rakotobe , the eldest son of radama 's eldest sister however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama these officers hid ramavo and one of her friends in a safe location , then secured the support of several influential power-brokers , including judges and the keepers of the sampy ( royal idols ) the officers then rallied the army behind ramavo , so that on august 11 , 1828 , when she declared herself the successor to radama on the pretence that he himself had decreed it , there could be no immediate resistance her coronation ceremony took place on june 12 , 1829 her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere in the traditional culture of imerina , rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs these policies were enacted in a context of increasing european influence within her kingdom and competing european bids for domination over the island ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor , radama i , in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island , and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns , high death rates among fanompoana workers , and harsh traditions of justice under her rule , the population of madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 , and the population of imerina from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 in the tradition of many of her list of malagasy monarchs , l'habitation à madagascar ( 1898 ) , pp between 1839 and 1842 , jean laborde built the queen a new residence called manjakamiadana , which became the largest structure on the rova grounds the residence was made entirely from wood and bore most of the features of a traditional home of the merina andriana ( aristocratic class ) , including a central pillar ( andry ) to support the roof the palace was eventually encased in stone in 1867 by james cameron of the london missionary society during the reign of ranavalona ii the queen 's most powerful ministers were also her consorts major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i & nbsp ; 45–47 in the early years of ranavalona 's reign , andriamihaja was the leader of her court 's progressive faction , who favored maintaining the relations with europe initiated under radama the conservative faction was led by the brothers rainimaharo and rainiharo , the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal sampy these talismans were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the merina people since at least the 16th century reign of ralambo the conservative faction conspired to reduce andriamahaja 's progressive influence over the queen , and in september 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason 423 field marshal rainiharo served as the queen 's first minister from 1830 to 1832 , then prime minister and commander-in-chief from 1832 to 1852 upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 he served as prime minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to the royal city of ambohimanga for his part in a plot against the queen 's son , radama ii due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics , ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes queen ranavalona continued the military incursions initiated under radama i to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to merina rule mass executions were common , and those who were spared were commonly brought back to imerina as slaves ( andevo ) , and their valuables seized as booty to increase the wealth of the crown approximately one million slaves entered imerina from coastal areas between 1820 and 1853 , constituting one-third of the total population in the central highlands and two-thirds of all residents in antananarivo one of the chief measures by which ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by ordeal of tangena if nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal , the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison 's effects , while among members of the slave class ( andevo ) , the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves the press was in heaviest use during the first several years of ranavalona 's reign , when thousands of hymnals and other materials were transcribed and printed 196 from the beginning of her reign , ranavalona forbade the distribution of books within the military to prevent subversion and preserve discipline in 1831 ranavalona authorized malagasy attendance at church services , administration of the sacrament , and baptism of her subjects 221 within a year , hundreds of malagasies were baptized ; ralibera and de taffin ( 1993 ) , p & nbsp ; 185–186 pursuant to the february 26 decree , those who possessed a bible , worshiped in congregation or continued to profess adherence to christianity were fined , jailed , manacled , subjected to trial by ordeal , or executed the protracted negotiations ensured the french suffered from the malaria prevalent in coastal areas , until the increasing casualties forced the ships ' withdrawal from ranavalona 's territory the french were eager to hasten radama ii 's succession in the interest of capitalizing on the lambert charter , an 1855 agreement between french representative joseph-françois lambert and radama that could only come into effect upon the prince 's succession in 1897 , french colonial authorities disinterred and moved the queen 's body and the remains of other merina sovereigns to the tombs at the rova of antananarivo in an attempt to desanctify ambohimanga ranavalona 's traditionalist policies were abruptly reversed under the reign of her son , king radama ii

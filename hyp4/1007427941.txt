375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir despite her elevated rank among the royal wives , ramavo was not the preferred wife of radama and did not bear him any children upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship radama died in the company of two trusted courtiers who were favorable to the succession of rakotobe however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama these officers hid ramavo and one of her friends in a safe location , then secured the support of several influential power-brokers , including judges and the keepers of the sampy ( royal idols ) the officers then rallied the army behind ramavo , so that on august 11 , 1828 , when she declared herself the successor to radama on the pretence that he himself had decreed it , there could be no immediate resistance her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere in the traditional culture of imerina , rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship , the traditional basis of the political order women , however , were associated with the household , a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign , and so were not viewed as suited to rule although female rulers had once been common among the vazimba , described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of madagascar , this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of andriamanelo ( 1540–1575 ) , founder of the kingdom of imerina and successor to his vazimba mother , queen rafohy ( 1530–1540 ) ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar these policies were enacted in a context of increasing european influence within her kingdom and competing european bids for domination over the island putting an end to most foreign trade relationships , the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance , made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of corvée—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor , radama i , in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island , and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns , high death rates among fanompoana workers , and harsh traditions of justice under her rule , the population of madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 , and the population of imerina from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 in the tradition of many of her list of malagasy monarchs , l'habitation à madagascar ( 1898 ) , pp the original wooden palace of ranavalona and virtually all other structures of the historic rova compound were destroyed in a 1995 fire , leaving only the stone shell to mark where her palace had once stood 427 in many respects , ranavalona 's rule was a continuation of precedent established under radama i both viewed foreigners with ambivalence , establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i the conservative faction conspired to reduce andriamahaja 's progressive influence over the queen , and in september 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father , andriantsilavonandriana , a hova ( commoner ) who had exceptionally been accorded the privilege of joining king andrianampoinimerina 's inner circle of noble advisers upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 traditionally , merina sovereigns relied on the pronouncement of kabary ( oratory ) in public gatherings to communicate policy and reaffirm the relationship between sovereign and public due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics , ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes these policies had a strongly negative effect on economic and population growth during her reign fanompoana labor among the population of imerina could include conscription into the military , enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers mass executions were common , and those who were spared were commonly brought back to imerina as slaves ( andevo ) , and their valuables seized as booty to increase the wealth of the crown approximately one million slaves entered imerina from coastal areas between 1820 and 1853 , constituting one-third of the total population in the central highlands and two-thirds of all residents in antananarivo additionally , a considerable proportion of the population not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of scorched earth policies although prevalent in the coastal parts of the island , malaria was uncommon in the high-altitude zone around antananarivo , and merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it an average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of ranavalona 's reign , contributing to severe depopulation in imerina one of the chief measures by which ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by ordeal of tangena a poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena ( cerbera manghas ) shrub and ingested , with the outcome determining innocence or guilt residents of madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes , including theft , christianity and especially witchcraft , for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory in october and november 1831 the queen enacted a ban on christian marriages , baptisms , and church services for soldiers and members of government studying in the missionary schools , ellis ( 1870 ) , p the queen 's army successfully repelled the french at the next port , forcing the ships to île sainte-marie , where they engaged a diplomatic envoy sent from antananarivo by ranavalona france did not however intend to take such an action without the accord of britain , whose influence had been well-established on the island , and refused to intercede on behalf of the prince 11 the queen 's foreign contemporaries strongly condemned her policies and viewed them as the actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman , a characterization that persisted in western historical literature until the 1970s

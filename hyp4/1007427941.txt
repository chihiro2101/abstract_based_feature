375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir despite her elevated rank among the royal wives , ramavo was not the preferred wife of radama and did not bear him any children upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage , the neglected ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with david griffiths and his fellow missionaries in griffiths ' home when radama died without leaving any descendants on july 27 , 1828 , according to local custom the rightful heir was rakotobe , the eldest son of radama 's eldest sister an intelligent and amiable young man , rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the london missionary society in antananarivo on the grounds of the royal palace radama died in the company of two trusted courtiers who were favorable to the succession of rakotobe however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama these officers hid ramavo and one of her friends in a safe location , then secured the support of several influential power-brokers , including judges and the keepers of the sampy ( royal idols ) the officers then rallied the army behind ramavo , so that on august 11 , 1828 , when she declared herself the successor to radama on the pretence that he himself had decreed it , there could be no immediate resistance ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar these policies were enacted in a context of increasing european influence within her kingdom and competing european bids for domination over the island in 1835 she forbade the practice of christianity among the malagasy population , and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory putting an end to most foreign trade relationships , the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance , made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of corvée—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor , radama i , in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island , and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns , high death rates among fanompoana workers , and harsh traditions of justice under her rule , the population of madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839 , and the population of imerina from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 these statistics have contributed to a strongly unfavorable view of ranavalona 's rule in historical accounts & nbsp ; 920–923 the queen ruled from the royal rova compound in antananarivo the palace was eventually encased in stone in 1867 by james cameron of the london missionary society during the reign of ranavalona ii 427 in many respects , ranavalona 's rule was a continuation of precedent established under radama i both viewed foreigners with ambivalence , establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems in addition , both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than metropolitan france ranavalona maintained the tradition of ruling with the support of advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class her first chief adviser was a young army officer from namehana named andriamihaja , who served as first minister from 1829 to 1830 the conservative faction conspired to reduce andriamahaja 's progressive influence over the queen , and in september 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father , andriantsilavonandriana , a hova ( commoner ) who had exceptionally been accorded the privilege of joining king andrianampoinimerina 's inner circle of noble advisers 423 field marshal rainiharo served as the queen 's first minister from 1830 to 1832 , then prime minister and commander-in-chief from 1832 to 1852 upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 queen ranavalona continued the military incursions initiated under radama i to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to merina rule fanompoana labor among the population of imerina could include conscription into the military , enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers 25 this army , which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces , exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to merina domination an average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of ranavalona 's reign , contributing to severe depopulation in imerina residents of madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes , including theft , christianity and especially witchcraft , for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory a printing press , which was imported by lms missionaries at the end of radama 's reign , was only effectively put into operation in 1828 208–209 translation of the new testament was completed in the second year of her reign , and 3,000 copies were printed and distributed between 1829 and 1830 in october and november 1831 the queen enacted a ban on christian marriages , baptisms , and church services for soldiers and members of government studying in the missionary schools , ellis ( 1870 ) , p 79 the precise number of malagasy citizens put to death for religious reasons during ranavalona 's reign is difficult to state with certainty & nbsp ; 225–277 according to a british account , however , radama himself was credited with warning the queen of the plot , in which his cooperation was merely a ploy to entrap the conspirators in 1897 , french colonial authorities disinterred and moved the queen 's body and the remains of other merina sovereigns to the tombs at the rova of antananarivo in an attempt to desanctify ambohimanga ranavalona 's traditionalist policies were abruptly reversed under the reign of her son , king radama ii the majority , regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies , consider her a remarkable figure in malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with european powers

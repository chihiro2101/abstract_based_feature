375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship these visits established a deep friendship between ramavo and griffiths that endured for three decades when radama died without leaving any descendants on july 27 , 1828 , according to local custom the rightful heir was rakotobe , the eldest son of radama 's eldest sister an intelligent and amiable young man , rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the london missionary society in antananarivo on the grounds of the royal palace however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama & nbsp ; 7–17 oliver ( 1886 ) , pp & nbsp ; 42–45 during this time , another courtier , a high-ranking military officer named andriamamba , discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – andriamihaja , rainijohary and ravalontsalama – to support ramavo 's claim to the throne 421–422 by succeeding her husband , ranavalona became the first female sovereign of the merina kingdom since its founding in 1540 in the traditional culture of imerina , rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar in 1835 she forbade the practice of christianity among the malagasy population , and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory putting an end to most foreign trade relationships , the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance , made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of corvée—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor , radama i , in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island , and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will in other ways it showcased distinctly european innovations , as it contained three floors entirely surrounded by wooden verandas and incorporated dormers in the shingled roof the palace was eventually encased in stone in 1867 by james cameron of the london missionary society during the reign of ranavalona ii both viewed foreigners with ambivalence , establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems in addition , both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than metropolitan france ranavalona maintained the tradition of ruling with the support of advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class her first chief adviser was a young army officer from namehana named andriamihaja , who served as first minister from 1829 to 1830 major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i & nbsp ; 45–47 in the early years of ranavalona 's reign , andriamihaja was the leader of her court 's progressive faction , who favored maintaining the relations with europe initiated under radama the conservative faction was led by the brothers rainimaharo and rainiharo , the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal sampy these talismans were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the merina people since at least the 16th century reign of ralambo upon rainiharo 's death , the queen wed another conservative , field marshal andrianisa ( also called rainijohary ) , who remained ranavalona 's husband until her death in 1861 he served as prime minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to the royal city of ambohimanga for his part in a plot against the queen 's son , radama ii due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics , ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes ranavalona innovated on these traditional rituals by increasing their complexity and symbolism to imbue them with added significance queen ranavalona continued the military incursions initiated under radama i to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to merina rule these policies had a strongly negative effect on economic and population growth during her reign 25 this army , which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces , exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to merina domination according to madagascar historian gwyn campbell , the number of non-merina who died in violent conflict during the military campaigns of ranavalona and her predecessor radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000 additionally , a considerable proportion of the population not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of scorched earth policies an average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of ranavalona 's reign , contributing to severe depopulation in imerina if nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal , the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison 's effects , while among members of the slave class ( andevo ) , the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves the accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin : if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared , but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt for instance , they reported the public execution of 15 christian leaders near the queen 's palace who were dangled on ropes 150 feet above a rock-filled ravine before the ropes were cut upon their refusal to renounce christianity 48 shortly after taking the throne , ranavalona annulled the anglo-merina treaty that had been concluded between radama and british envoys , and refused to continue receiving annual payments from britain in exchange for adherence to the stipulations of the treaty 63 it came to the queen 's attention that frenchman jean laborde , who had been shipwrecked off madagascar in 1832 , was knowledgeable in the production of cannons , muskets and gunpowder according to pfeiffer , radama and lambert had planned to dethrone the queen on june 20 , when ministers and soldiers loyal to radama would infiltrate the rova grounds and declare loyalty to the prince and support for a political transition while the queen had designated her son , radama ii , as her successor , rainimaharo and the conservative faction knew of his progressive leanings and tried instead to ensure the queen 's nephew , ramboasalama , would come to power and maintain loyalties to them and their political agenda

princess ramavo was born in 1778 at the royal residence at ambatomanoina , campbell ( 2012 ) , p 375 when ramavo was still a young girl , her father alerted king andrianampoinimerina ( 1787–1810 ) to an assassination plot planned by andrianjafy , the king 's uncle , whom andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of ambohimanga in return for saving his life , andrianampoinimerina betrothed ramavo to his son , radama i , whom the king designated as his heir he furthermore declared that any child from this union would be first in the line of succession after radama upon andrianampoinimerina 's death in 1810 , radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among ramavo 's relatives , an act that may have strained their relationship unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage , the neglected ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with david griffiths and his fellow missionaries in griffiths ' home an intelligent and amiable young man , rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the first school established by the london missionary society in antananarivo on the grounds of the royal palace radama died in the company of two trusted courtiers who were favorable to the succession of rakotobe however , they hesitated to report the news of radama 's death for several days , fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king 's rivals , whose family had a stake in the succession after radama sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship , the traditional basis of the political order women , however , were associated with the household , a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign , and so were not viewed as suited to rule ranavalona 's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the kingdom of imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of madagascar these policies were enacted in a context of increasing european influence within her kingdom and competing european bids for domination over the island these statistics have contributed to a strongly unfavorable view of ranavalona 's rule in historical accounts in the tradition of many of her list of malagasy monarchs , l'habitation à madagascar ( 1898 ) , pp between 1839 and 1842 , jean laborde built the queen a new residence called manjakamiadana , which became the largest structure on the rova grounds the residence was made entirely from wood and bore most of the features of a traditional home of the merina andriana ( aristocratic class ) , including a central pillar ( andry ) to support the roof in other ways it showcased distinctly european innovations , as it contained three floors entirely surrounded by wooden verandas and incorporated dormers in the shingled roof the palace was eventually encased in stone in 1867 by james cameron of the london missionary society during the reign of ranavalona ii both monarchs encouraged the introduction of new technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad , supported the establishment of an industrialized economy , and adopted measures to professionalize the army both viewed foreigners with ambivalence , establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems ranavalona maintained the tradition of ruling with the support of advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class the queen 's most powerful ministers were also her consorts her first chief adviser was a young army officer from namehana named andriamihaja , who served as first minister from 1829 to 1830 major-general andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen 's only son , prince rakoto ( later king radama ii ) , who was born eleven months after the death of his official father , king radama i & nbsp ; 45–47 in the early years of ranavalona 's reign , andriamihaja was the leader of her court 's progressive faction , who favored maintaining the relations with europe initiated under radama 423 field marshal rainiharo served as the queen 's first minister from 1830 to 1832 , then prime minister and commander-in-chief from 1832 to 1852 he served as prime minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to the royal city of ambohimanga for his part in a plot against the queen 's son , radama ii due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics , ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes ranavalona innovated on these traditional rituals by increasing their complexity and symbolism to imbue them with added significance additionally , a considerable proportion of the population not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of scorched earth policies deaths among the merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high , estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820–1853 a further 25–50 % of the queen 's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have died each year due to diseases such as malaria although prevalent in the coastal parts of the island , malaria was uncommon in the high-altitude zone around antananarivo , and merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it an average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of ranavalona 's reign , contributing to severe depopulation in imerina one of the chief measures by which ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by ordeal of tangena she allowed missionaries free rein in operating the printing press , however , and exempted from military service all malagasy personnel trained to operate the press in a kabary speech on february 26 , 1835 , queen ranavalona formally forbade the practice of christianity among her subjects 225 having failed to gain the backing of a european state power to place radama on the throne and bring the treaty into effect , lambert decided to instigate a coup d'état independently he traveled to ranavalona 's court in may 1857 in the company of the celebrated 19th-century austrian globetrotter ida pfeiffer , who became an unwitting participant in the plot according to pfeiffer , radama and lambert had planned to dethrone the queen on june 20 , when ministers and soldiers loyal to radama would infiltrate the rova grounds and declare loyalty to the prince and support for a political transition ranavalona 's traditionalist policies were abruptly reversed under the reign of her son , king radama ii

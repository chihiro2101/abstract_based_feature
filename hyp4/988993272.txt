similarly , one can derive pleasure louise bogan , 'the pleasures of formal poetry ' , in reginald gibbons ( ed byron 's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for why the language is pleasurable , and how byron achieved this effect a poem having a regular rhythm ( not all poems do ) is said to follow a certain meter in '' the destruction of sennacherib '' , each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable , with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line those basic patterns are called feet , and this particular pattern ( weak weak strong ) is called an anapest this poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm , and that rhythm has a name : this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter ( this process of analyzing a poem 's rhythms is called scansion in this case , the rhymes come right next to each other , which emphasizes them , and therefore emphasizes the sound , the physical nature , of the language the effect of the poem 's language derives in part from byron 's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme ( or rhyme scheme ) : these adjacent , rhyming lines are called couplets some forms are strictly defined , with required line counts and rhyming patterns , such as the sonnet or limerick others ( which exhibit open form ) have less structure or , indeed , almost no apparent structure at all a poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern , a specific design among the many exemplary works of blank verse in english are milton 's paradise lost and most of the verse passages from shakespeare 's plays , such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from hamlet : : to be , or not to be—that is the question : whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer : the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , : or to take arms against a sea of troubles : and by opposing end them to die , to sleep — : no more , and by a sleep to say we end : the heartache and the thousand natural shocks : that flesh is heir to rather , most lines have five strong syllables , and most are preceded by a weak syllable two masters of the form are alexander pope and john dryden the form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor , as in the opening of pope 's an essay on criticism : ’ tis hard to say , if greater want of skill : appear in writing or in judging ill ; : but , of the two , less dang ’ rous is th ’ offence , : to tire our patience , than mislead our sense : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose typically , the octave introduces a situation , idea , or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution recognizing this , shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to english by creating an alternate rhyme scheme : abab cdcd efef gg : this thou perceiv'st , which makes thy love more strong , : to love that well which thou must leave ere long ) any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick , however most also follow an aabba rhyme scheme in contrast , a poet using free verse ( sometimes called '' open form '' ) seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem , letting the structure grow out of the poem 's subject matter or inspiration in the best open form poems , the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form kennedy has said , '' should the poet succeed , then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying '' ( 582 ) sounds aloud walt whitman was an important innovator of open form , and he demonstrates its merits in '' a noiseless patient spider '' before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance , however , the reader should establish the theme of the poem for example : '' another '' tells of a buried child ; '' the destruction of sennacherib '' tells of the annihilation of an assyrian army by divine intervention ; '' the silken tent '' compares a woman to a tent english language poetic meter depends on stress , rather than the number of syllables skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length , and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect , as robert browning does in the first line of '' my last duchess '' : : that 's my last duchess painted on the wall to analyze the poem , the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units : a brief , evocative image— '' a leaf falls '' —appearing , like an unbidden thought , in the middle of a word , '' loneliness '' an analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself , with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as plato at the same time , many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by t glossary of poetry terms the close reading of poetry : a practical introduction and guide to explication online poem analyzer appreciation of poem the planners poem appreciation , workshop of various classes

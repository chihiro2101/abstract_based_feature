'' the destruction of sennacherib '' , by lord byron similarly , one can derive pleasure louise bogan , 'the pleasures of formal poetry ' , in reginald gibbons ( ed byron 's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud the lines have a powerful , rolling , and very evident rhythm , and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for why the language is pleasurable , and how byron achieved this effect the lines are not simply rhythmic : the rhythm is regular within a line , and is the same for each line a poem having a regular rhythm ( not all poems do ) is said to follow a certain meter in '' the destruction of sennacherib '' , each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable , with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line a line with four feet is said to be in tetrameter ( tetra- , from the greek for four ) this poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm , and that rhythm has a name : this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter ( this process of analyzing a poem 's rhythms is called scansion the effect of the poem 's language derives in part from byron 's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme ( or rhyme scheme ) : these adjacent , rhyming lines are called couplets the sound , the physical nature , of the language is also emphasized by alliteration , as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line : '' and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea '' some forms are strictly defined , with required line counts and rhyming patterns , such as the sonnet or limerick others ( which exhibit open form ) have less structure or , indeed , almost no apparent structure at all a poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern , a specific design : whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer : the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , : or to take arms against a sea of troubles : and by opposing end them to die , to sleep — : no more , and by a sleep to say we end : the heartache and the thousand natural shocks : that flesh is heir to note that shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet the form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor , as in the opening of pope 's an essay on criticism : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose the form originated in italy , and the word derives from '' sonetto '' , which is italian for '' little song '' the octave presents the speaker 's experience of the sound of the sea , coming to him from some distance : in me thou seest the glowing of such fire : that on the ashes of his youth doth lie , : as the deathbed whereon it must expire , : consumed with that which it was nourished by in lines 1–4 , the speaker compares his time of life to autumn in lines 5–8 , the comparison is to twilight ; in lines 9–12 , the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire in contrast , a poet using free verse ( sometimes called '' open form '' ) seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem , letting the structure grow out of the poem 's subject matter or inspiration in the best open form poems , the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form the long , rolling lines—unified , held together like strong cords , by alliteration and assonance—partake of the same nature as the spider 's filaments and the soul 's threads two balanced stanzas , one describing a spider , the other the speaker 's soul , perfectly frame the implicit comparison , with neither being privileged over the other just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance , the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words : isolated/detached , launched/fling , tirelessly/ceaselessly , surrounding/surrounded it was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century english but a more recent example is charles williams ' the masque of the manuscript , in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth nonetheless , they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems ( especially those employing closed form ) less common , but frequently important for the variety and energy they bring to a line , are the monosyllabic foot ( weak ) and the spondee ( strong strong ) schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them ( such as imagism ) , or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet ( for example the movement ) the characteristics of such poems include ( but are not limited to ) a strong narrative , regular poetic meter , simple content and simple form glossary of poetry terms the close reading of poetry : a practical introduction and guide to explication online poem analyzer appreciation of poem the planners poem appreciation , workshop of various classes

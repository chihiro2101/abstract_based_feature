similarly , one can derive pleasure louise bogan , 'the pleasures of formal poetry ' , in reginald gibbons ( ed byron 's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud the lines have a powerful , rolling , and very evident rhythm , and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect the poem does not have a deep , hidden , symbolic meaning a poem having a regular rhythm ( not all poems do ) is said to follow a certain meter in '' the destruction of sennacherib '' , each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable , with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line those basic patterns are called feet , and this particular pattern ( weak weak strong ) is called an anapest a line with four feet is said to be in tetrameter ( tetra- , from the greek for four ) this poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm , and that rhythm has a name : this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter ( this process of analyzing a poem 's rhythms is called scansion the effect of the poem 's language derives in part from byron 's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme ( or rhyme scheme ) : these adjacent , rhyming lines are called couplets the sound , the physical nature , of the language is also emphasized by alliteration , as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line : '' and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea '' others ( which exhibit open form ) have less structure or , indeed , almost no apparent structure at all a poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern , a specific design among the many exemplary works of blank verse in english are milton 's paradise lost and most of the verse passages from shakespeare 's plays , such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from hamlet : : to be , or not to be—that is the question : whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer : the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , : or to take arms against a sea of troubles : and by opposing end them note that shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line rather , most lines have five strong syllables , and most are preceded by a weak syllable rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet the form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor , as in the opening of pope 's an essay on criticism : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose typically , the octave introduces a situation , idea , or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution in the sestet , this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man 's connection to creation and his experience of the numinous recognizing this , shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to english by creating an alternate rhyme scheme : abab cdcd efef gg : this thou perceiv'st , which makes thy love more strong , : to love that well which thou must leave ere long ( the beginning of the metrical foot does not have to coincide with the beginning of the line ) any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick , however most also follow an aabba rhyme scheme in the best open form poems , the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance , the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words : isolated/detached , launched/fling , tirelessly/ceaselessly , surrounding/surrounded the poem has form , but the form was not imposed by previous conventions before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance , however , the reader should establish the theme of the poem an analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind there are many different 'schools ' of poetry : oral , classical , romantic , modernist , etc schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them ( such as imagism ) , or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet ( for example the movement ) poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself , with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as plato at the same time , many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by t sounds aloud open form poetic verse ( kindle ebook asin b008qvudk2 ) 2012 bowen , neil glossary of poetry terms the close reading of poetry : a practical introduction and guide to explication online poem analyzer appreciation of poem the planners poem appreciation , workshop of various classes

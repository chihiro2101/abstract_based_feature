similarly , one can derive pleasure louise bogan , 'the pleasures of formal poetry ' , in reginald gibbons ( ed byron 's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for why the language is pleasurable , and how byron achieved this effect the lines are not simply rhythmic : the rhythm is regular within a line , and is the same for each line a poem having a regular rhythm ( not all poems do ) is said to follow a certain meter in '' the destruction of sennacherib '' , each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable , with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line this poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm , and that rhythm has a name : this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter ) the poem also rhymes ( not all poems do ) , and the rhymes follow a pattern ( they do not have to ) in this case , the rhymes come right next to each other , which emphasizes them , and therefore emphasizes the sound , the physical nature , of the language the effect of the poem 's language derives in part from byron 's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme ( or rhyme scheme ) : these adjacent , rhyming lines are called couplets the sound , the physical nature , of the language is also emphasized by alliteration , as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line : '' and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea '' some forms are strictly defined , with required line counts and rhyming patterns , such as the sonnet or limerick others ( which exhibit open form ) have less structure or , indeed , almost no apparent structure at all this appearance , though , is deceptive : successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem 's effect on the reading mind some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the english language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets ( sonnets , sestinas , limericks , and so forth ) , while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside ( frost 's '' stopping by woods on a snowy evening '' is a good example ) of all closed forms in english prosody , none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than blank verse , which is verse that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme : whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer : the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , : or to take arms against a sea of troubles : and by opposing end them the meter provides a rhythm that informs the line : it is not an invariable formula the form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor , as in the opening of pope 's an essay on criticism : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose in each of these , a group of eight lines ( the octave ) is followed by a group of six ( the sextet ) recognizing this , shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to english by creating an alternate rhyme scheme : abab cdcd efef gg : in me thou seest the twilight of such day : as after sunset fadeth in the west , : which by and by black night doth steal away , : death 's second self , which seals up all in rest : this thou perceiv'st , which makes thy love more strong , : to love that well which thou must leave ere long ) any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick , however most also follow an aabba rhyme scheme most limericks are humorous , and many are ribald , or outright obscene ( possible rhymes that could follow an opening like '' there once was a man from nantucket '' are left as an exercise for the reader ) in contrast , a poet using free verse ( sometimes called '' open form '' ) seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem , letting the structure grow out of the poem 's subject matter or inspiration sounds aloud walt whitman was an important innovator of open form , and he demonstrates its merits in '' a noiseless patient spider '' the long , rolling lines—unified , held together like strong cords , by alliteration and assonance—partake of the same nature as the spider 's filaments and the soul 's threads two balanced stanzas , one describing a spider , the other the speaker 's soul , perfectly frame the implicit comparison , with neither being privileged over the other just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance , the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words : isolated/detached , launched/fling , tirelessly/ceaselessly , surrounding/surrounded part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem ( who is speaking ) , and the rest of kipling 's just so stories : the events in the poem ; when these occur ; where is the 'speaker ' and where do the events occur ; why does the speaker speak ? william harmon has suggested that starting an analysis with : '' this poem dramatizes the conflict between nonetheless , they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems ( especially those employing closed form ) the use of specific words in the poem serve to create a tone—an attitude taken towards the subject a detached tone , or an opposite tone than the reader would expect , are sometimes purposely employed to elicit more of a response poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself , with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as plato how to read a poem and fall in love with poetry how to analyse poetry – art of poetry : volumes ones and two ( pushmepress.com )

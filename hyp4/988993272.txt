similarly , one can derive pleasure louise bogan , 'the pleasures of formal poetry ' , in reginald gibbons ( ed byron 's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud the lines have a powerful , rolling , and very evident rhythm , and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore in other words , the physicality of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem 's effect critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for why the language is pleasurable , and how byron achieved this effect the lines are not simply rhythmic : the rhythm is regular within a line , and is the same for each line a poem having a regular rhythm ( not all poems do ) is said to follow a certain meter this poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm , and that rhythm has a name : this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter ( this process of analyzing a poem 's rhythms is called scansion ) the poem also rhymes ( not all poems do ) , and the rhymes follow a pattern ( they do not have to ) in this case , the rhymes come right next to each other , which emphasizes them , and therefore emphasizes the sound , the physical nature , of the language the sound , the physical nature , of the language is also emphasized by alliteration , as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line : '' and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea '' some forms are strictly defined , with required line counts and rhyming patterns , such as the sonnet or limerick among the many exemplary works of blank verse in english are milton 's paradise lost and most of the verse passages from shakespeare 's plays , such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from hamlet : : to be , or not to be—that is the question note that shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line rather , most lines have five strong syllables , and most are preceded by a weak syllable rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet two masters of the form are alexander pope and john dryden : some few in that , but numbers err in this , : ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss ; : a fool might once himself alone expose , : now one in verse makes many more in prose fourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a sonnet in the sestet , this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man 's connection to creation and his experience of the numinous english has ( proportionally ) far fewer rhyming words than italian in lines 5–8 , the comparison is to twilight ; in lines 9–12 , the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire most limericks are humorous , and many are ribald , or outright obscene ( possible rhymes that could follow an opening like '' there once was a man from nantucket '' are left as an exercise for the reader ) nonetheless , the form is capable of sophisticated and playful expression : : titian was mixing rose madder in the best open form poems , the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form kennedy has said , '' should the poet succeed , then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying '' ( 582 ) the poem has form , but the form was not imposed by previous conventions the surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases ( notably , the works of william mcgonagall ) there is little beyond the immediate before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance , however , the reader should establish the theme of the poem curiously , this verse uses metaphors to challenge the use of indirect approaches to their subject for most poets—even the plain-speaking herbert—metaphor is the fundamental means of communicating complexity succinctly allegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work often the poet communicates emotionally by selecting words with particular connotations this often makes scansion ( the analysis of metrical patterns ) seem unduly arcane and arbitrary to students of the craft : l ( a : le : af : fa : ll : s ) : one : l : iness cummings has fractured language into its most atomic elements although reading aloud to oneself raises eyebrows in many circles , few people find it surprising in the case of poetry at the same time , many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by t how to read a poem and fall in love with poetry

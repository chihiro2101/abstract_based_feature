stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables , and may have a higher or lower pitch there are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation – in particular , vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central ( or '' neutral '' ) articulation , while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) syllables are frequently said to be in pretonic or post-tonic position ; certain phonological rules apply specifically to such positions in standard chinese , which is a tonal language , stressed syllables have been found to have tones realized with a relatively large swing in fundamental frequency , while unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress for example , in czech , finnish , icelandic and hungarian , the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word in armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word in quechua , esperanto , and polish , the stress is almost always on the penult ( second-last syllable ) statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation , prosodic factors ( see below ) come into play , which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress stress is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word in such languages with phonemic stress , the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words a syllable with secondary stress is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress in some analyses , for example the one found in chomsky and halle 's the sound pattern of english , english has been described as having four levels of stress : primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary , but the treatments often disagree with one another prosodic stress , or sentence stress , refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a prosodic unit it may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language , but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance ( contrastive stress ) an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) ( a word spoken alone becomes such a phrase , hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases the main stress within a sentence , often found on the last stressed word , is called the nuclear stress japanese ) , whose syllables or moras are spoken at a roughly constant rate regardless of stress ( the acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs , as in ( '' the '' ) and ( '' or '' ) ; here the stress of the two words is the same linguists frequently mark primary stress with an acute accent over the vowel , and secondary stress by a grave accent for example , si-lab-if-i-kay-shun or si-lab-if-i-kay-shun in russian , belarusian and ukrainian dictionaries , stress is indicated with an acute accent ( ´ ) on a syllable 's vowel ( example :

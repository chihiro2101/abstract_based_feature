there are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream , and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables , and may have a higher or lower pitch there are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation – in particular , vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central ( or '' neutral '' ) articulation , while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) in standard chinese , which is a tonal language , stressed syllables have been found to have tones realized with a relatively large swing in fundamental frequency , while unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress for example , in czech , finnish , icelandic and hungarian , the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word in armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word in quechua , esperanto , and polish , the stress is almost always on the penult ( second-last syllable ) french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language stress is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter in many languages with lexical stress , it is stress and vowel reduction , which means that vowel quality differs by whether vowels are stressed or unstressed the spanish word is stressed on the first syllable in spain but on the second syllable in the americas some languages are described as having both primary stress and secondary stress prosodic stress , or sentence stress , refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a prosodic unit an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) ) another type of prosodic stress pattern is quantity sensitivity – in some languages additional stress tends to be placed on syllables that are longer ( moraically heavy ) for instance , consider the dialogue in it , the stress-related acoustic differences between the syllables of '' tomorrow '' would be small compared to the differences between the syllables of '' dinner '' , the emphasized word the main stress within a sentence , often found on the last stressed word , is called the nuclear stress many other languages , such as finnish and the mainstream dialects of spanish , do not have unstressed vowel reduction ; in these languages vowels in unstressed syllables have nearly the same quality as those in stressed syllables ( the acute accent is also used on some monosyllables in order to distinguish homographs , as in ( '' the '' ) and ( '' or '' ) ; here the stress of the two words is the same if the last syllable is stressed , the accent mark is used if the word ends in the letters n , s , or a vowel , as in though not part of normal orthography , a number of devices exist that are used by linguists and others to indicate the position of stress ( and syllabification in some cases ) when it is desirable to do so dal 's explanatory dictionary , marked stress with an apostrophe just after the vowel ( example : ; see secondary stress may be unmarked or marked with a grave accent :

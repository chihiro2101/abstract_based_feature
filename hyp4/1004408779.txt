there are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream , and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables , and may have a higher or lower pitch there are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation – in particular , vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central ( or '' neutral '' ) articulation , while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress in armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word in quechua , esperanto , and polish , the stress is almost always on the penult ( second-last syllable ) other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation , prosodic factors ( see below ) come into play , which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress stress is usually truly lexical and must be memorized as part of the pronunciation of an individual word in such languages with phonemic stress , the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter some languages are described as having both primary stress and secondary stress a syllable with secondary stress is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress as with primary stress , the position of secondary stress may be more or less predictable depending on language prosodic stress , or sentence stress , refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a prosodic unit it may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language , but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance ( contrastive stress ) an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) ( a word spoken alone becomes such a phrase , hence such prosodic stress may appear to be lexical if the pronunciation of words is analyzed in a standalone context rather than within phrases for instance , consider the dialogue in it , the stress-related acoustic differences between the syllables of '' tomorrow '' would be small compared to the differences between the syllables of '' dinner '' , the emphasized word the main stress within a sentence , often found on the last stressed word , is called the nuclear stress if the last syllable is stressed , the accent mark is used if the word ends in the letters n , s , or a vowel , as in in english dictionaries that show pronunciation by respelling , stress is typically marked with a prime mark placed after the stressed syllable : /si-lab′-ə-fi-kay′-shən/ dal 's explanatory dictionary , marked stress with an apostrophe just after the vowel ( example : ; see secondary stress may be unmarked or marked with a grave accent :

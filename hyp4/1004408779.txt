there are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream , and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables , and may have a higher or lower pitch they may also sometimes be pronounced longer there are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation â€“ in particular , vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central ( or '' neutral '' ) articulation , while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) in standard chinese , which is a tonal language , stressed syllables have been found to have tones realized with a relatively large swing in fundamental frequency , while unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings ( see also stress in standard chinese lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress in armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables french words are sometimes said to be stressed on the final syllable , but that can be attributed to the prosodic stress that is placed on the last syllable ( unless it is a schwa , when stress is placed on the second-last syllable ) of any string of words in that language languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress sometimes , stress is fixed for all forms of a particular word , or it can fall on different syllables in different inflections of the same word in such languages with phonemic stress , the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter dialects of the same language may have different stress placement as with primary stress , the position of secondary stress may be more or less predictable depending on language ( for further detail see stress and vowel reduction in english it may involve a certain natural stress pattern characteristic of a given language , but may also involve the placing of emphasis on particular words because of their relative importance ( contrastive stress ) an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) for instance , consider the dialogue in it , the stress-related acoustic differences between the syllables of '' tomorrow '' would be small compared to the differences between the syllables of '' dinner '' , the emphasized word the main stress within a sentence , often found on the last stressed word , is called the nuclear stress that is , if a word is written without an accent mark , the stress is on the penult if the last letter is a vowel , n , or s , but on the final syllable if the word ends in any other letter linguists frequently mark primary stress with an acute accent over the vowel , and secondary stress by a grave accent if the acute accent sign is unavailable for technical reasons , stress can be marked by making the vowel capitalized or italic

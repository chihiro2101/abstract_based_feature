there are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream , and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables , and may have a higher or lower pitch there are sometimes differences in place or manner of articulation – in particular , vowels in unstressed syllables may have a more central ( or '' neutral '' ) articulation , while those in stressed syllables have a more peripheral articulation stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) a prominent syllable or word is said to be accented or tonic ; the latter term does not imply that it carries phonemic tone in standard chinese , which is a tonal language , stressed syllables have been found to have tones realized with a relatively large swing in fundamental frequency , while unstressed syllables typically have smaller swings ) stressed syllables are often perceived as being more forceful than non-stressed syllables lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word the position of lexical stress in a word may depend on certain general rules applicable in the language or dialect in question , but in other languages , it must be learned for each word , as it is largely unpredictable in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress for example , in czech , finnish , icelandic and hungarian , the stress almost always comes on the first syllable of a word other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables statements about the position of stress are sometimes affected by the fact that when a word is spoken in isolation , prosodic factors ( see below ) come into play , which do not apply when the word is spoken normally within a sentence languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress sometimes , stress is fixed for all forms of a particular word , or it can fall on different syllables in different inflections of the same word in many languages with lexical stress , it is stress and vowel reduction , which means that vowel quality differs by whether vowels are stressed or unstressed the spanish word is stressed on the first syllable in spain but on the second syllable in the americas as with primary stress , the position of secondary stress may be more or less predictable depending on language in english , it is not fully predictable , but the different secondary stress of the words organization and accumulation ( on the first and second syllable , respectively ) is predictable due to the same stress of the verbs órganize and accúmulate peter ladefoged and other phoneticians have noted that it is possible to describe english with only one degree of stress , as long as prosody is recognized and unstressed vowel are phonemically distinguished for vowel reduction prosodic stress , or sentence stress , refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a prosodic unit an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) doing this can change or clarify the meaning of a sentence ; for example : as in the examples above , stress is normally transcribed as italics in printed text or underlining in handwriting in many languages , such as russian and english , vowel reduction may occur when a vowel changes from a stressed to an unstressed position ) in spanish language , stress may be written explicitly with a single acute accent on a vowel in the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ) , primary stress is indicated by a high vertical line ( primary stress mark : ) before the stressed element , secondary stress by a low vertical line ( secondary stress mark : ) in dutch , ad hoc indication of stress is usually marked by an acute accent on the vowel ( or , in the case of a diphthong or double vowel , the first two vowels ) of the stressed syllable

there are various ways in which stress manifests itself in the speech stream , and these depend to some extent on which language is being spoken stressed syllables are often louder than non-stressed syllables , and may have a higher or lower pitch stress may be realized to varying degrees on different words in a sentence ; sometimes the difference between the acoustic signals of stressed and unstressed syllables are minimal in some contexts , the term stress or stress accent is used to mean specifically dynamic accent ( or as an antonym to pitch accent in its various meanings ) lexical stress , or word stress , is the stress placed on a given syllable in a word in some cases , classes of words in a language differ in their stress properties ; for example , loanwords into a language with fixed stress may preserve stress placement from the source language , or the sezer stress in some languages , the placement of stress can be determined by rules languages in which the position of the stress can usually be predicted by a simple rule are said to have fixed stress in armenian the stress is on the last syllable of a word in macedonian , it is on the antepenult ( third-last syllable ) other languages have stress placed on different syllables but in a predictable way , as in classical arabic and latin , where stress is conditioned by the structure of particular syllables french ( some authors add chinese ) can be considered to have no real lexical stress languages in which the position of stress in a word is not fully predictable are said to have phonemic stress in some languages , such as spanish , portuguese , lakota and , to some extent , italian , stress is even represented in writing using diacritical marks , for example in the spanish words and sometimes , stress is fixed for all forms of a particular word , or it can fall on different syllables in different inflections of the same word in such languages with phonemic stress , the position of stress can serve to distinguish otherwise identical words for example , the english words insight and incite are distinguished in pronunciation only by the fact that the stress falls on the first syllable in the former and on the second syllable in the latter some languages are described as having both primary stress and secondary stress a syllable with secondary stress is stressed relative to unstressed syllables but not as strongly as a syllable with primary stress ( for further detail see stress and vowel reduction in english prosodic stress , or sentence stress , refers to stress patterns that apply at a higher level than the individual word – namely within a prosodic unit an example of a natural prosodic stress pattern is that described for french above ; stress is placed on the final syllable of a string of words ( or if that is a schwa , the next-to-final syllable ) ) another type of prosodic stress pattern is quantity sensitivity – in some languages additional stress tends to be placed on syllables that are longer ( moraically heavy ) prosodic stress is also often used pragmatics to emphasize ( focus attention on ) particular words or the ideas associated with them doing this can change or clarify the meaning of a sentence ; for example : as in the examples above , stress is normally transcribed as italics in printed text or underlining in handwriting the main stress within a sentence , often found on the last stressed word , is called the nuclear stress ) in spanish language , stress may be written explicitly with a single acute accent on a vowel that is , if a word is written without an accent mark , the stress is on the penult if the last letter is a vowel , n , or s , but on the final syllable if the word ends in any other letter dal 's explanatory dictionary , marked stress with an apostrophe just after the vowel ( example : ; see secondary stress may be unmarked or marked with a grave accent :

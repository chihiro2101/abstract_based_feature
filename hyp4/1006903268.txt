the idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern england was first mentioned in elizabethan times , between 1558 and 1603 , to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers avon and thames , only apart at their closest later , around 1626 , henry briggs made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig he proposed a canal to connect them , but following his death in 1630 the plan was dropped plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century however , in 1715 , work was authorised to make the river kennet navigable from reading to newbury in 1723 , despite considerable local opposition , the kennet navigation opened , comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with of artificially created lock cuts the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure in 1788 a '' western canal '' was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as hungerford , marlborough , calne , chippenham and melksham the following year the engineers barns , simcock and weston submitted a proposed route for this canal , although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time the proposed route was accepted by the kennet and avon canal company , chaired by charles dundas , and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders the newbury to hungerford section was completed in 1798 , and was extended to great bedwyn in 1799 the section from bath to foxhangers was finished in 1804 , and devizes locks were completed in 1810 when the flight of locks opened in 1810 , allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal , the rate of carriage per ton from london to bath was £2 & nbsp ; 9s & nbsp ; 6d this compared well with carriage by road , which cost £6 & nbsp ; 3s to £7 per ton , and trade on the canal flourished in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading at the same time work was undertaken to improve the avon navigation , from bristol to bath , with the kennet and avon canal company purchasing a majority shareholding in the avon navigation in 1816 by 1818 , seventy 60-ton barges were working on the canal , the majority of the tonnage being coal and stone travelling via the somerset coal canal a link connecting the kennet & avon to the basingstoke canal at its basingstoke terminus was proposed three times between 1793 and 1810 , and a route was even surveyed by john rennie the younger in 1824 , but following opposition from landowners was eventually rejected by parliament in 1824 and 1826 in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal in 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made any profit the somerset coal canal and wilts & berks canal , which each supplied some of the trade from the somerset coalfield to the kennet and avon , closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively in 1926 , following a loss of £18,041 the previous year , the great western railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a ministry of transport order , but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal during the second world war a large number of concrete pillboxes were built as part of the ghq line to defend against an expected german invasion ; many of these are still visible along the banks of the canal in 1955 john gould , a trader on the eastern section of the waterway , successfully petitioned against the commission 's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business they were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the queen , brought to london from bristol by water ; parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity it was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the kennet and avon canal association in 1963 the newly formed british waterways , which was created by the transport act of the previous year , and replaced the british transport commission as the statutory body for inland waterways , took over the canal and , in partnership with the trust and riparian local authorities , restoration work began the avoncliff aqueduct was lined with a concrete '' cradle '' and made water-tight in 1980 wessex water agreed to the extraction of per day from the avon at claverton to be pumped east ; the costs of the pumps was £175,000 the restoration of the dundas aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route , while fund-raising activities continued restoration of the turf-sided monkey marsh lock proved difficult because of its status as a scheduled monument , and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure the modern avon is navigable from its mouth at avonmouth , through the bristol harbour in bristol , as far as pulteney weir in the centre of bath and just beyond the start of the canal it is the first lock east of netham , the upstream limit of the floating harbour , beyond the suburbs of the city of bristol a colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock , but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century the river below hanham lock is considered to be tide , as high tides often pass over the weir at netham heading east , the river passes the somerdale factory , on its southern bank , which was a chocolate production factory for cadbury – originally built by the fry family in the 1920s and 1930s the river then passes through avon valley country park and past stidham farm , another sssi that contains pleistocene terrace-gravels of the river the river passes under the old railway line that now forms the avon valley railway , a heritage railway , before reaching swineford lock • • • • • on the eastern outskirts of bath a toll bridge near the george inn links bathampton to batheaston , on the north bank of the canal in the avon valley to the east of bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found : road , rail , river , canal the canal passes the remains of a loading dock , once used for bath stone from the quarries on bathampton down , which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the dry arch rock bridge ( demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the a36 ) next , the canal passes the waterwheel-powered claverton pumping station , which pumped water from the river avon into the canal on the eastern bank warleigh wood and inwood are ash-wych elm and ash-maple dry woodland , which comes right down to the canal the canal then crosses over the river and the wessex main line railway at the dundas aqueduct , past conkwell wood , before recrossing the river and railway at the avoncliff aqueduct from there to hungerford the canal follows the valley of the river dun through freeman 's marsh , which consists of unimproved meadows , marsh and reedbed east of newbury town centre the kennet passes through the thatcham reed beds a site of special scientific interest , nationally important for its extensive reedbed , and species-rich alder woodland and fen habitats it is a favourite haunt of several famous canal enthusiasts including canal boat veterans and original kennet and avon restoration supporters , prunella scales and timothy west the kennet and avon canal trust operates shops and tearooms at aldermaston lock , newbury lock , crofton pumping station , devizes , and bradford on avon

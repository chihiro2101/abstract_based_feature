the idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern england was first mentioned in elizabethan times , between 1558 and 1603 , to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers avon and thames , only apart at their closest later , around 1626 , henry briggs made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century work commenced in 1718 , under the supervision of surveyor and engineer john hore of newbury in 1723 , despite considerable local opposition , the kennet navigation opened , comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with of artificially created lock cuts the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure in 1788 a '' western canal '' was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as hungerford , marlborough , calne , chippenham and melksham the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time in 1793 a further survey was conducted by john rennie , and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through great bedwyn , devizes , trowbridge and newbury on 17 april 1794 the kennet and avon canal act received the royal assent and construction began the newbury to hungerford section was completed in 1798 , and was extended to great bedwyn in 1799 the section from bath to foxhangers was finished in 1804 , and devizes locks were completed in 1810 when the flight of locks opened in 1810 , allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal , the rate of carriage per ton from london to bath was £2 & nbsp ; 9s & nbsp ; 6d in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading the purchase was authorised by the kennet navigation act of june 1813 , which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each at the same time work was undertaken to improve the avon navigation , from bristol to bath , with the kennet and avon canal company purchasing a majority shareholding in the avon navigation in 1816 a link connecting the kennet & avon to the basingstoke canal at its basingstoke terminus was proposed three times between 1793 and 1810 , and a route was even surveyed by john rennie the younger in 1824 , but following opposition from landowners was eventually rejected by parliament in 1824 and 1826 the opening of the great western railway in 1841 removed much of the canal 's traffic , even though the canal company lowered tariffs in 1852 the railway company took over the canal 's operation , levying high tolls at every toll point and reducing the amount spent on maintenance in 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night , and , in 1865 , boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal the somerset coal canal and wilts & berks canal , which each supplied some of the trade from the somerset coalfield to the kennet and avon , closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively in 1926 , following a loss of £18,041 the previous year , the great western railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a ministry of transport order , but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal cargo trade continued to decline , but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal the last through passage was made in 1951 by nb queen they were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the queen , brought to london from bristol by water ; parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity restoration work involved a collaboration between staff from british waterways and volunteer labour in 1968 , restoration work was undertaken on the bath locks and burghfield lock in wiltshire concerns over the limited water supply to the summit , at the highest point of the canal , indicated that back-pumping would be required , which increased the estimated cost for the county to £761,560 wessex water agreed to the extraction of per day from the avon at claverton to be pumped east ; the costs of the pumps was £175,000 in 1983 the manpower services commission , which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the united kingdom , agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of aldermaston lock , its adjacent wharf , and widmead lock the restoration of the dundas aqueduct and several smaller schemes were later added to the list in 1988 the restoration of woolhampton lock was completed , but obstructions remained on either side frounds swing bridge could not be opened and the restoration of midgham lock had not been finished ; both were completed the following year in 2011 the department for environment , food and rural affairs designated the canal a national '' cruiseway '' as defined by the transport act 1968 the listing imposes a legal requirement on british waterways to maintain the canal to a standard that ensures cruising craft can safely navigate the entire length of the waterway in november 2011 the navigation between bath and bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about victoria bridge the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure the modern avon is navigable from its mouth at avonmouth , through the bristol harbour in bristol , as far as pulteney weir in the centre of bath and just beyond the start of the canal beyond pulteney weir the avon is still navigable as far as the weir and site of the old '' flash lock '' at bathampton but the lock at pulteney has been replaced only with a small boat slide for dinghies and canoes -- > lock number one on the kennet and avon canal is hanham lock , first opened as part of the avon navigation in 1727 a colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock , but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century the river then passes through avon valley country park and past stidham farm , another sssi that contains pleistocene terrace-gravels of the river the river passes under the old railway line that now forms the avon valley railway , a heritage railway , before reaching swineford lock the lock was opened in 1727 but destroyed by rival coal dealers in 1738 , to prevent the river being used for transportation in the avon valley to the east of bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found : road , rail , river , canal in the village of semington the wilts & berks canal joined the canal , linking the kennet and avon to the river thames at abingdon the canal passes through an area known as the kennet valley alderwoods , the largest remaining fragments of damp , ash-alder woodland in the river kennet floodplain the village of woolhampton and the canal settlement of aldermaston wharf are the only significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of reading at sheffield lock in theale the kennet and avon canal trust operates shops and tearooms at aldermaston lock , newbury lock , crofton pumping station , devizes , and bradford on avon the kennet and avon canal trust national cycle route 4

the main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between bristol and london was a hazardous sea route through the english channel the small coastal sailing ships of the day were often damaged by atlantic storms , and risked being attacked by warships of the french navy and privateers during a succession of conflicts with france plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure the two river navigations were built independently of one another , in order to meet local needs , but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a through route in 1788 a '' western canal '' was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as hungerford , marlborough , calne , chippenham and melksham the following year the engineers barns , simcock and weston submitted a proposed route for this canal , although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time in 1793 a further survey was conducted by john rennie , and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through great bedwyn , devizes , trowbridge and newbury the proposed route was accepted by the kennet and avon canal company , chaired by charles dundas , and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders on 17 april 1794 the kennet and avon canal act received the royal assent and construction began the section from bath to foxhangers was finished in 1804 , and devizes locks were completed in 1810 major structures included the dundas and avoncliff aqueducts , the bruce tunnel under savernake forest , and the pumping stations at claverton and crofton , needed to overcome water supply problems when the flight of locks opened in 1810 , allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal , the rate of carriage per ton from london to bath was £2 & nbsp ; 9s & nbsp ; 6d this compared well with carriage by road , which cost £6 & nbsp ; 3s to £7 per ton , and trade on the canal flourished in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading at the same time work was undertaken to improve the avon navigation , from bristol to bath , with the kennet and avon canal company purchasing a majority shareholding in the avon navigation in 1816 the journey from bath to newbury took an average of three and a half days the opening of the great western railway in 1841 removed much of the canal 's traffic , even though the canal company lowered tariffs in 1852 the railway company took over the canal 's operation , levying high tolls at every toll point and reducing the amount spent on maintenance in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal in 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made any profit cargo trade continued to decline , but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal after the war the transport act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the british transport commission , but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the avoncliff aqueduct a group supporting the restoration of the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the inland waterways association , with which it was subsequently merged in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' further reports followed , and in 1962 the advisory committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped , and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration it was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the kennet and avon canal association in 1968 , restoration work was undertaken on the bath locks and burghfield lock the canal was reopened from the thames to hungerford wharf in july 1974 in wiltshire concerns over the limited water supply to the summit , at the highest point of the canal , indicated that back-pumping would be required , which increased the estimated cost for the county to £761,560 maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route , while fund-raising activities continued the stretch between reading and newbury was completed on 17 july 1990 ; at a ceremony held at monkey marsh lock several boats competed to be the first craft through concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when queen elizabeth ii formally reopened the canal on 8 august 1990 in november 2011 the navigation between bath and bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about victoria bridge the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure it is the first lock east of netham , the upstream limit of the floating harbour , beyond the suburbs of the city of bristol a colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock , but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century the river below hanham lock is considered to be tide , as high tides often pass over the weir at netham the weir side of the island is also the mouth of the river chew here , between 1709 and 1859 , there was an active brass and copper industry served by the river , which also provided water power for the cloth industry the remains of kelston brass mill , which was working until 1925 , are next to saltford lock the lock was opened in 1727 but destroyed by rival coal dealers in 1738 , to prevent the river being used for transportation the bristol and bath railway path crosses the navigation several times before reaching the suburb of newbridge on the outskirts of bath the final lock before entering bath is weston lock , opened in 1727 the restored bath locks marks the divergence of the river avon and the canal the next of the six bath locks is bath deep lock , numbered 8/9 as two locks were combined when the canal was restored in 1976 the new chamber has a depth of , making it the uk 's second-deepest canal lock just above the deep lock is another side pound as a reservoir for refilling the lock , followed by wash house lock at the western end of the dundas aqueduct it is joined by the remains of the somerset coal canal , a short stretch of which has been restored to create the brassknocker basin the stretch from newbury to high bridge in reading is an improved river navigation known as the kennet navigation , opened in 1723 privately owned craft and hire boats from the range of marinas are much in evidence , and there are numerous canoe clubs along its length the kennet and avon canal trust operates shops and tearooms at aldermaston lock , newbury lock , crofton pumping station , devizes , and bradford on avon

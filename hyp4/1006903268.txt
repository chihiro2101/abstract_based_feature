the idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern england was first mentioned in elizabethan times , between 1558 and 1603 , to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers avon and thames , only apart at their closest later , around 1626 , henry briggs made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig the small coastal sailing ships of the day were often damaged by atlantic storms , and risked being attacked by warships of the french navy and privateers during a succession of conflicts with france plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century however , in 1715 , work was authorised to make the river kennet navigable from reading to newbury the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure the two river navigations were built independently of one another , in order to meet local needs , but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a through route in 1788 a '' western canal '' was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as hungerford , marlborough , calne , chippenham and melksham the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time in 1793 a further survey was conducted by john rennie , and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through great bedwyn , devizes , trowbridge and newbury on 17 april 1794 the kennet and avon canal act received the royal assent and construction began the newbury to hungerford section was completed in 1798 , and was extended to great bedwyn in 1799 in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading the purchase was authorised by the kennet navigation act of june 1813 , which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each at the same time work was undertaken to improve the avon navigation , from bristol to bath , with the kennet and avon canal company purchasing a majority shareholding in the avon navigation in 1816 the opening of the great western railway in 1841 removed much of the canal 's traffic , even though the canal company lowered tariffs in 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made any profit the last through passage was made in 1951 by nb queen in 1955 john gould , a trader on the eastern section of the waterway , successfully petitioned against the commission 's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' further reports followed , and in 1962 the advisory committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped , and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity in 1968 , restoration work was undertaken on the bath locks and burghfield lock re-puddling was a long process , so experiments with the use of heavy gauge polythene to line the canal were undertaken the avoncliff aqueduct was lined with a concrete '' cradle '' and made water-tight in 1980 in 1988 the restoration of woolhampton lock was completed , but obstructions remained on either side re-puddling of the crofton pounds was carried out in 1989 , along with the reconstruction of midgham bridge restoration of the turf-sided monkey marsh lock proved difficult because of its status as a scheduled monument , and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety the queen was able to travel on the trust 's boat , the rose of hungerford , through locks 44 and 43 on the caen hill flight , breaking a ceremonial tape between them the shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29 & nbsp ; locks at caen hill in devizes , at a cost of £1 & nbsp ; million in 2011 the department for environment , food and rural affairs designated the canal a national '' cruiseway '' as defined by the transport act 1968 the listing imposes a legal requirement on british waterways to maintain the canal to a standard that ensures cruising craft can safely navigate the entire length of the waterway in november 2011 the navigation between bath and bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about victoria bridge the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure the modern avon is navigable from its mouth at avonmouth , through the bristol harbour in bristol , as far as pulteney weir in the centre of bath and just beyond the start of the canal -- > lock number one on the kennet and avon canal is hanham lock , first opened as part of the avon navigation in 1727 some spring tides pass over the weir at hanham , making the river tidal up to keynsham lock a public house has been built on the island between keynsham lock and the weir the river passes under the old railway line that now forms the avon valley railway , a heritage railway , before reaching swineford lock its construction created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as dutch island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century the restored bath locks marks the divergence of the river avon and the canal just upstream of the bottom lock are a side pound and a pumping station that pumps water '' upstream '' of the locks , to replace that used each time a boat passes through the new chamber has a depth of , making it the uk 's second-deepest canal lock after a slightly longer pound is abbey view lock , beside which there is another pumping station and then , in quick succession , pulteney lock and bath top lock cleveland tunnel is long and runs under cleveland house , the former headquarters of the kennet and avon canal company and now a grade ii listed building the resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive to a number of migrants ; wader such as dunlin , ringed and little ringed plover , and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn the canal turns south into a valley between bathampton wood and bathford hill which includes brown 's folly , a biological and geological site of special scientific interest the canal passes the remains of a loading dock , once used for bath stone from the quarries on bathampton down , which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the dry arch rock bridge ( demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the a36 ) on the eastern bank warleigh wood and inwood are ash-wych elm and ash-maple dry woodland , which comes right down to the canal the first sod for the kennet and avon canal was turned in bradford on avon in 1794 , and soon there were wharves above and below bradford lock the canal passes through an area known as the kennet valley alderwoods , the largest remaining fragments of damp , ash-alder woodland in the river kennet floodplain the kennet and avon canal trust operates shops and tearooms at aldermaston lock , newbury lock , crofton pumping station , devizes , and bradford on avon the kennet and avon canal trust national cycle route 4

the main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between bristol and london was a hazardous sea route through the english channel however , in 1715 , work was authorised to make the river kennet navigable from reading to newbury in 1723 , despite considerable local opposition , the kennet navigation opened , comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with of artificially created lock cuts the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure in 1788 a '' western canal '' was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as hungerford , marlborough , calne , chippenham and melksham the following year the engineers barns , simcock and weston submitted a proposed route for this canal , although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time in 1793 a further survey was conducted by john rennie , and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through great bedwyn , devizes , trowbridge and newbury the proposed route was accepted by the kennet and avon canal company , chaired by charles dundas , and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders the final engineering task was the completion of the caen hill locks at devizes in 1801 , trade along the canal commenced ; goods initially had to be unloaded at foxhangers at the bottom of what is now caen hill locks , transported up the hill by a wagonway , and reloaded into barges at the top in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading the purchase from frederick page cost £100,000 , of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually by 1818 , seventy 60-ton barges were working on the canal , the majority of the tonnage being coal and stone travelling via the somerset coal canal the journey from bath to newbury took an average of three and a half days in 1852 the railway company took over the canal 's operation , levying high tolls at every toll point and reducing the amount spent on maintenance ice-breaking was stopped in 1857 , and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal in 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night , and , in 1865 , boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal the somerset coal canal and wilts & berks canal , which each supplied some of the trade from the somerset coalfield to the kennet and avon , closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively in 1926 , following a loss of £18,041 the previous year , the great western railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a ministry of transport order , but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal cargo trade continued to decline , but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal after the war the transport act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the british transport commission , but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the avoncliff aqueduct in 1955 john gould , a trader on the eastern section of the waterway , successfully petitioned against the commission 's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business the act was opposed by gould and by the local authorities along the canal in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity this was replaced with a new bridge , enabling craft to pass more easily the canal was reopened from the thames to hungerford wharf in july 1974 re-puddling was a long process , so experiments with the use of heavy gauge polythene to line the canal were undertaken the county council in berkshire , supported by local councils , estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges wessex water agreed to the extraction of per day from the avon at claverton to be pumped east ; the costs of the pumps was £175,000 in 1983 the manpower services commission , which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the united kingdom , agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of aldermaston lock , its adjacent wharf , and widmead lock maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route , while fund-raising activities continued frounds swing bridge could not be opened and the restoration of midgham lock had not been finished ; both were completed the following year re-puddling of the crofton pounds was carried out in 1989 , along with the reconstruction of midgham bridge concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when queen elizabeth ii formally reopened the canal on 8 august 1990 in november 2011 the navigation between bath and bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about victoria bridge the modern avon is navigable from its mouth at avonmouth , through the bristol harbour in bristol , as far as pulteney weir in the centre of bath and just beyond the start of the canal beyond pulteney weir the avon is still navigable as far as the weir and site of the old '' flash lock '' at bathampton but the lock at pulteney has been replaced only with a small boat slide for dinghies and canoes -- > lock number one on the kennet and avon canal is hanham lock , first opened as part of the avon navigation in 1727 it is the first lock east of netham , the upstream limit of the floating harbour , beyond the suburbs of the city of bristol some spring tides pass over the weir at hanham , making the river tidal up to keynsham lock heading east , the river passes the somerdale factory , on its southern bank , which was a chocolate production factory for cadbury – originally built by the fry family in the 1920s and 1930s the river then passes through avon valley country park and past stidham farm , another sssi that contains pleistocene terrace-gravels of the river here , between 1709 and 1859 , there was an active brass and copper industry served by the river , which also provided water power for the cloth industry the bristol and bath railway path crosses the navigation several times before reaching the suburb of newbridge on the outskirts of bath the final lock before entering bath is weston lock , opened in 1727 between wootton top lock and crofton is the summit pound of the canal at above sea level , stretching for about and including the bruce tunnel near crofton is savernake forest and the remains of a railway bridge that carried the midland and south western junction railway over the canal to the north of the canal are seven separate small areas , four in the kennet valley and three in the river lambourn , which make up the kennet and lambourn floodplain sssi the stretch from newbury to high bridge in reading is an improved river navigation known as the kennet navigation , opened in 1723 the kennet and avon canal trust operates shops and tearooms at aldermaston lock , newbury lock , crofton pumping station , devizes , and bradford on avon

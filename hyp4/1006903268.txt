he proposed a canal to connect them , but following his death in 1630 the plan was dropped however , in 1715 , work was authorised to make the river kennet navigable from reading to newbury the river avon had historically been navigable from bristol to bath , but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure the two river navigations were built independently of one another , in order to meet local needs , but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a through route the following year the engineers barns , simcock and weston submitted a proposed route for this canal , although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply the name was changed from western canal to kennet and avon canal to avoid confusion with the grand western canal , which was being proposed at the same time in july 1793 rennie suggested further alterations to the route , including the construction of a tunnel in the savernake forest on 17 april 1794 the kennet and avon canal act received the royal assent and construction began the section from bath to foxhangers was finished in 1804 , and devizes locks were completed in 1810 in 1801 , trade along the canal commenced ; goods initially had to be unloaded at foxhangers at the bottom of what is now caen hill locks , transported up the hill by a wagonway , and reloaded into barges at the top when the flight of locks opened in 1810 , allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal , the rate of carriage per ton from london to bath was £2 & nbsp ; 9s & nbsp ; 6d this compared well with carriage by road , which cost £6 & nbsp ; 3s to £7 per ton , and trade on the canal flourished in 1812 , the kennet and avon canal company bought the kennet navigation , which stretched from newbury to the junction with the thames at kennet mouth , near reading the purchase was authorised by the kennet navigation act of june 1813 , which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each at the same time work was undertaken to improve the avon navigation , from bristol to bath , with the kennet and avon canal company purchasing a majority shareholding in the avon navigation in 1816 the journey from bath to newbury took an average of three and a half days by 1832 , 300,000 & nbsp ; tons of freight was being carried each year and , between 1825 and 1834 , the company had an annual revenue of around £45,000 a link connecting the kennet & avon to the basingstoke canal at its basingstoke terminus was proposed three times between 1793 and 1810 , and a route was even surveyed by john rennie the younger in 1824 , but following opposition from landowners was eventually rejected by parliament in 1824 and 1826 in the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near fobney lock followed the regulations introduced in the reading local board waterworks , sewerage , drainage and improvements act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal in 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made any profit in 1926 , following a loss of £18,041 the previous year , the great western railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a ministry of transport order , but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal during the second world war a large number of concrete pillboxes were built as part of the ghq line to defend against an expected german invasion ; many of these are still visible along the banks of the canal they were generally built close to road and rail bridges , which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles in july 1958 , the bowes committee published their inquiry into inland waterways which specifically mentioned the kennet and avon finding '' no justification for restoring the section from reading to bath '' the kennet and avon canal trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from reading to bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity it was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the kennet and avon canal association the trust gained charitable status in april and was incorporated under the companies act on 6 june 1962 in 1963 the newly formed british waterways , which was created by the transport act of the previous year , and replaced the british transport commission as the statutory body for inland waterways , took over the canal and , in partnership with the trust and riparian local authorities , restoration work began the canal was reopened from the thames to hungerford wharf in july 1974 the county council in berkshire , supported by local councils , estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges wessex water agreed to the extraction of per day from the avon at claverton to be pumped east ; the costs of the pumps was £175,000 the shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29 & nbsp ; locks at caen hill in devizes , at a cost of £1 & nbsp ; million the river avon was navigable from bristol to bath during the early years of the 13th century , until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure the modern avon is navigable from its mouth at avonmouth , through the bristol harbour in bristol , as far as pulteney weir in the centre of bath and just beyond the start of the canal a colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock , but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century the river below hanham lock is considered to be tide , as high tides often pass over the weir at netham a depth of at least of sandy gravels are recorded , consisting mainly of limestone clasts , but also with millstone grit , pennant sandstone , flint , and chert clasts here , between 1709 and 1859 , there was an active brass and copper industry served by the river , which also provided water power for the cloth industry the remains of kelston brass mill , which was working until 1925 , are next to saltford lock its construction created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as dutch island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century the restored bath locks marks the divergence of the river avon and the canal when the a4 batheaston by-pass was built , the bathampton meadow was created to provide additional flood relief the resultant wet meadows and oxbow lake have proved attractive to a number of migrants ; wader such as dunlin , ringed and little ringed plover , and green and common sandpiper are frequent visitors in spring and autumn in the avon valley to the east of bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found : road , rail , river , canal the canal passes the remains of a loading dock , once used for bath stone from the quarries on bathampton down , which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the dry arch rock bridge ( demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the a36 ) next , the canal passes the waterwheel-powered claverton pumping station , which pumped water from the river avon into the canal on the eastern bank warleigh wood and inwood are ash-wych elm and ash-maple dry woodland , which comes right down to the canal at the western end of the dundas aqueduct it is joined by the remains of the somerset coal canal , a short stretch of which has been restored to create the brassknocker basin excavations of the old stop lock showed that it was originally a broad lock that at some point was narrowed to by moving the lock wall a number of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about east of the summit pound , and about below it , and arrangements were made for them to feed the pound below lock 60 at crofton the river kennet is navigable from newbury downstream to the confluence with the river thames at kennet mouth , in reading the kennet and avon canal trust operates shops and tearooms at aldermaston lock , newbury lock , crofton pumping station , devizes , and bradford on avon list of locks on the kennet and avon canal waterways in the united kingdom

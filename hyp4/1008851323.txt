the theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with albert einstein 's 1915 theory of general relativity general relativity can be employed to describe the universe on the largest possible scale there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe eddington : in some of these solutions , the universe has been expanding from an initial singularity which was , essentially , the big bang in 1927 , georges lema√Ætre set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe as a result , the big bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density these three adjectives refer to the overall shape of the universe , and not to the local curving of spacetime caused by smaller clumps of mass ( for example , galaxies and stars ) if the primary content of the universe is inert matter , as in the dust models popular for much of the 20th century , there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration , nearly always by invoking dark energy , which in its simplest form is just a positive cosmological constant in general , dark energy is a catch-all term for any hypothesized field with negative pressure , usually with a density that changes as the universe expands the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang conversely , a negative cosmological constant , which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure , would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch the big freeze ( or big chill ) is a scenario under which continued expansion results in a universe that asymptote approaches absolute zero temperature the universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes , with each finite universe ending with a big crunch that is also the big bang of the next universe it derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the big bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion it is possible that the dark energy equation of state could change again resulting in an event that would have consequences which are extremely difficult to predict or parametrize

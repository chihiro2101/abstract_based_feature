the theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with albert einstein 's 1915 theory of general relativity general relativity can be employed to describe the universe on the largest possible scale there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe eddington : in some of these solutions , the universe has been expanding from an initial singularity which was , essentially , the big bang in 1929 , edwin hubble published his conclusion , based on his observations of cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies , that the universe was expanding from then on , the beginning of the universe and its possible end have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation in 1927 , georges lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe as a result , the big bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe however , after hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding , einstein would write that his cosmological constant was '' the greatest blunder of my life an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring \omega , or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating in general , dark energy is a catch-all term for any hypothesized field with negative pressure , usually with a density that changes as the universe expands recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy , whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever—even if \omega > 1 just as the big bang started as a cosmological expansion , this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and the universe will begin contracting the universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes , with each finite universe ending with a big crunch that is also the big bang of the next universe it derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the big bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe this theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment choosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing ' the universe , for example , measuring the relative contributions of matter , radiation , dark matter , and dark energy to the critical density

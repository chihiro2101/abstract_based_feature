the theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with albert einstein 's 1915 theory of general relativity there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe eddington : in some of these solutions , the universe has been expanding from an initial singularity which was , essentially , the big bang in 1929 , edwin hubble published his conclusion , based on his observations of cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies , that the universe was expanding in 1927 , georges lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring \omega , or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration , nearly always by invoking dark energy , which in its simplest form is just a positive cosmological constant the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe however , other recent measurements by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe suggest that the universe is either flat or very close to flat in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy , whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever—even if \omega > 1 even without dark energy , a negatively curved universe expands forever , with gravity negligibly slowing the rate of expansion if the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that \omega 1 , then the geometry of the universe is flat : as in euclidean geometry , the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance in the absence of dark energy , a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate , with expansion asymptotically approaching zero ; with dark energy , the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down , due to the effects of gravity , but eventually increases , and the ultimate fate of the universe becomes the same as that of an open universe with a positive cosmological constant , it could also occur in a closed universe just as the big bang started as a cosmological expansion , this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and the universe will begin contracting according to one version of the big bang theory of cosmology , in the beginning the universe was infinitely dense also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion choosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing ' the universe , for example , measuring the relative contributions of matter , radiation , dark matter , and dark energy to the critical density

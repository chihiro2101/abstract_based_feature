the theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with albert einstein 's 1915 theory of general relativity there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe in 1929 , edwin hubble published his conclusion , based on his observations of cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies , that the universe was expanding from then on , the beginning of the universe and its possible end have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation in 1927 , georges lema√Ætre set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe as a result , the big bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density this selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether \omega is equal to , less than , or greater than 1 if the primary content of the universe is inert matter , as in the dust models popular for much of the 20th century , there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring \omega , or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating role of the shape of the universe the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang even without dark energy , a negatively curved universe expands forever , with gravity negligibly slowing the rate of expansion the fate of the universe is determined by its density the universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes , with each finite universe ending with a big crunch that is also the big bang of the next universe it derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the big bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe according to one version of the big bang theory of cosmology , in the beginning the universe was infinitely dense as the nature of dark energy and dark matter remain enigmatic , even hypothetical , the possibilities surrounding their coming role in the universe are currently unknown

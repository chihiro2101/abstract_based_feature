the theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with albert einstein 's 1915 theory of general relativity there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe in 1929 , edwin hubble published his conclusion , based on his observations of cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies , that the universe was expanding in 1927 , georges lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe as a result , the big bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring \omega , or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating starting in 1998 , observations of supernovas in distant galaxy have been interpreted as consistent with a universe whose accelerating universe the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory however , other recent measurements by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe suggest that the universe is either flat or very close to flat some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy , whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever—even if \omega > 1 even without dark energy , a negatively curved universe expands forever , with gravity negligibly slowing the rate of expansion conversely , a negative cosmological constant , which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure , would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch if the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that \omega 1 , then the geometry of the universe is flat : as in euclidean geometry , the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance in the absence of dark energy , a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate , with expansion asymptotically approaching zero ; with dark energy , the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down , due to the effects of gravity , but eventually increases , and the ultimate fate of the universe becomes the same as that of an open universe the preponderance of evidence to date , based on measurements of the rate of expansion and the mass density , favors a universe that will continue to expand indefinitely , resulting in the '' big freeze '' scenario below in the special case of phantom energy , which has supposed negative kinetic energy that would result in a higher rate of acceleration than other cosmological constants predict , a more sudden big rip could occur the universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes , with each finite universe ending with a big crunch that is also the big bang of the next universe it derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the big bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe also , if the universe is closed , this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the big bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion

the theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with albert einstein 's 1915 theory of general relativity there are several possible solutions to the equations of general relativity , and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe eddington : in some of these solutions , the universe has been expanding from an initial singularity which was , essentially , the big bang in 1929 , edwin hubble published his conclusion , based on his observations of cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies , that the universe was expanding from then on , the beginning of the universe and its possible end have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation in 1927 , georges lemaître set out a theory that has since come to be called the big bang theory of the origin of the universe as a result , the big bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe an important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the density parameter , omega ( \omega ) , defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density these three adjectives refer to the overall shape of the universe , and not to the local curving of spacetime caused by smaller clumps of mass ( for example , galaxies and stars ) if the primary content of the universe is inert matter , as in the dust models popular for much of the 20th century , there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry starting in 1998 , observations of supernovas in distant galaxy have been interpreted as consistent with a universe whose accelerating universe the current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape , how much dark energy it contains and on the equation of state which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe recent observations conclude , from 7.5 billion years after the big bang , that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing , commensurate with the open universe theory in a closed universe , gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe , after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point , a final singularity termed the '' big crunch '' , the opposite of the big bang some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy , whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever—even if \omega > 1 conversely , a negative cosmological constant , which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure , would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch if the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that \omega 1 , then the geometry of the universe is flat : as in euclidean geometry , the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance the preponderance of evidence to date , based on measurements of the rate of expansion and the mass density , favors a universe that will continue to expand indefinitely , resulting in the '' big freeze '' scenario below the universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes , with each finite universe ending with a big crunch that is also the big bang of the next universe choosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing ' the universe , for example , measuring the relative contributions of matter , radiation , dark matter , and dark energy to the critical density

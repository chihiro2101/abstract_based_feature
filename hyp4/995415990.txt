paul on new year 's eve , lord peter wimsey helps ring a nine-hour peal on the church bells overnight after william thoday , one of the ringers , is struck down with influenza lady thorpe , wife of sir henry , the local squire , dies the next morning and wimsey hears how the family has been blighted by the theft 20 years previously of a valuable emerald necklace which was never recovered the family 's then butler , deacon , and his accomplice from london , cranton , were convicted and imprisoned he apparently died shortly afterwards : the body lay in a quarry pit , where it was found two years later , still in his prison clothes after deacon 's death became known his widow , mary , had married william thoday when sir henry himself dies the following easter , his wife 's grave is opened for his burial and a man 's body is found , mutilated beyond recognition it is possibly that of an out-of-work labourer calling himself 'stephen driver ' who had arrived in the village in early january ; although , oddly , the dead man was wearing underclothes that had been made in france it appears that the dead man may in fact be cobbleigh , cranton having killed him after retrieving the emeralds wimsey realises that they have gone there to be remarried , as mary recognised the handwriting on the cipher as that of deacon , her first husband , and realised that her wedding to william was void because deacon was still alive at the time wimsey is now able to identify the dead man : it was deacon himself , who had not in fact died at the quarry as had been thought desperate to protect his wife from the scandal of a bigamous marriage , he had tied deacon up and locked him in the bell chamber , planning to bribe him to leave the country the next day jim , appalled at william 's apparent brutality but loyal to him , had waited until the night following lady thorpe 's funeral , when he had made the body unrecognisable , hidden it in her grave , then returned to his ship when the body was rediscovered at easter , each of the thoday brothers thought that the other had killed deacon the appalling noise in the bell chamber convinces him that deacon , tied there for hours during the all-night new year peal , could not have survived : deacon had been killed by the bells themselves sayers â€™ obituarist , writing in the new york times in 1957 , noted that many critics regarded the nine tailors as her finest literary achievement

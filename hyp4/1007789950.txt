according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class the appointment of these one hundred men into the senate gave them a noble status this noble status is what separated the patricians from the plebeians this would coincide with the idea that ancient rome was founded on a merit-based ideal 56 other noble families which came to rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate , including several who emigrated from alba longa , after that city was destroyed by tullus hostilius the last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century bc was when the claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to rome in 504 bc , five years after the establishment of the republic the distinction between the noble class , the patricians , and the roman populace , the plebeians , existed from the beginning of ancient rome the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic being of the noble class meant that patricians were able to participate in government and politics , while the plebeians could not during the middle and late republic , as this influence gradually eroded , plebeians were granted equal rights in most areas , and even greater in some additionally , not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in ancient rome while it was not illegal for a plebeian to run for political office , a plebeian would have not have had the backing needed to win a seat since society was organized in this way , the patrician class was essentially in complete control of ancient rome 's government for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of rome disappeared as rome acquired its empire , and new plebeian families rose to prominence a number of patrician families such as the horatii , lucretii , verginii and menenii rarely appear in positions of importance during the later republic many old families had both patrician and plebeian branches , of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity , and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes the distinction between patricians and plebs in ancient rome was based purely on birth although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families , plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy as civil rights for plebeians increased during the middle and late roman republic , many plebeian families had attained wealth and power while some traditionally patrician families had fallen into poverty and obscurity however , no amount of wealth could change one 's class if a marriage was to occur between a patrician and a plebeian , the children of that marriage would then be given patrician status since the patricians were of high social status , they did not want to lose this status ; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status eventually , the plebeian class came together and created their own governing body , the plebeian council the assembly separated citizens into classes , however , the top two class , equestrians and patricians , were able to control the majority of the vote after the conflict of the orders , according to mathisen , plebeians were able to rise in politics and become members of the senate , which used to be exclusively for patricians the title of , '' first patrician '' ) is also evidenced in the east from 367 to 711 , possibly referring to the senior-most holder of the office and leader of the patrician order the laws of the roman people : public law in the expansion and decline of the roman republic

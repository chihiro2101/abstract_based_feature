according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class this noble status is what separated the patricians from the plebeians this would coincide with the idea that ancient rome was founded on a merit-based ideal 56 other noble families which came to rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate , including several who emigrated from alba longa , after that city was destroyed by tullus hostilius the last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century bc was when the claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to rome in 504 bc , five years after the establishment of the republic the distinction between the noble class , the patricians , and the roman populace , the plebeians , existed from the beginning of ancient rome the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic the patricians in ancient rome were of the same status as aristocrats in greek society being of the noble class meant that patricians were able to participate in government and politics , while the plebeians could not during the middle and late republic , as this influence gradually eroded , plebeians were granted equal rights in most areas , and even greater in some originally patrician , publius clodius pulcher willingly arranged to be adopted by a plebeian family in order to qualify to be appointed as the tribune of the plebs roman republic and empire this status difference was marked at the beginning of the republic : patricians were better represented in the roman assemblies , only patricians could hold high political offices , such as dictator , consul , and censor , and all priesthoods ( such as pontifex maximus ) were closed to non-patricians having the best land would allow the patrician class to have more opportunities , such as being able to produce better agriculture in cassius ' accounts of ancient rome , he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class he indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing about the specific shoes the patricians wore for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of rome disappeared as rome acquired its empire , and new plebeian families rose to prominence many old families had both patrician and plebeian branches , of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity , and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes the distinction between patricians and plebs in ancient rome was based purely on birth although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families , plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy if a marriage was to occur between a patrician and a plebeian , the children of that marriage would then be given patrician status eventually , the plebeians became unsatisfied with being the lower class and not having the same rights and privileges as the patricians since the patricians were of high social status , they did not want to lose this status ; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status the assembly separated citizens into classes , however , the top two class , equestrians and patricians , were able to control the majority of the vote ancient rome , according to ralph mathisen , author of ancient roman civilization : history and sources , made political reforms , such as the introduction of the council of the plebs and the tribunes of the plebs however it remained one of the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the 11th century , being awarded to the most important ( provincial governors and generals ) of the empire the patrician title was occasionally used in western europe after the end of the roman empire ; for instance , pope stephen ii granted the title '' patricius of the romans '' to the frankish ruler pepin the short

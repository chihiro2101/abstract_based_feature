according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class this noble status is what separated the patricians from the plebeians 56 other noble families which came to rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate , including several who emigrated from alba longa , after that city was destroyed by tullus hostilius the last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century bc was when the claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to rome in 504 bc , five years after the establishment of the republic the distinction between the noble class , the patricians , and the roman populace , the plebeians , existed from the beginning of ancient rome the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic the patricians in ancient rome were of the same status as aristocrats in greek society being of the noble class meant that patricians were able to participate in government and politics , while the plebeians could not this privilege was important in ancient roman history and ended up causing a large divide between the two classes with the exception of some religious offices which were devoid of political power , plebeians were able to stand for all of the offices that were open to patricians originally patrician , publius clodius pulcher willingly arranged to be adopted by a plebeian family in order to qualify to be appointed as the tribune of the plebs roman republic and empire there was a belief that patricians communicated better with the roman gods , so they alone could perform the sacred rites and take the augury additionally , not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in ancient rome having the best land would allow the patrician class to have more opportunities , such as being able to produce better agriculture this view had political consequences , since in the beginning of the year or before a military campaign , roman magistrates used to consult the gods livy reports that the first admission of plebeians into a priestly college happened in 300 bc with the passage of the lex ogulnia , when the college of augurs raised their number from four to nine in cassius ' accounts of ancient rome , he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class he indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing about the specific shoes the patricians wore for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of rome disappeared as rome acquired its empire , and new plebeian families rose to prominence many old families had both patrician and plebeian branches , of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity , and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes the distinction between patricians and plebs in ancient rome was based purely on birth eventually , the plebeians became unsatisfied with being the lower class and not having the same rights and privileges as the patricians this time in roman history is called the conflict of the orders , which took place between 500-287 bce even once these laws were written down , and the new centuriate assembly was created , the patrician class remained in power this meant , that while the plebeians were able to vote , if the patrician classes voted together , they could control the vote this prestige gradually declined further , and by the end of the 3rd-century crisis patrician status , as it had been known in the republic , ceased to have meaning in everyday life

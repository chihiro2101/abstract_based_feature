according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class the appointment of these one hundred men into the senate gave them a noble status this noble status is what separated the patricians from the plebeians this would coincide with the idea that ancient rome was founded on a merit-based ideal 56 other noble families which came to rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate , including several who emigrated from alba longa , after that city was destroyed by tullus hostilius the distinction between the noble class , the patricians , and the roman populace , the plebeians , existed from the beginning of ancient rome the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic the patricians in ancient rome were of the same status as aristocrats in greek society being of the noble class meant that patricians were able to participate in government and politics , while the plebeians could not this privilege was important in ancient roman history and ended up causing a large divide between the two classes with the exception of some religious offices which were devoid of political power , plebeians were able to stand for all of the offices that were open to patricians plebeians of the nobiles were no less wealthy than patricians at the height of the republic additionally , not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in ancient rome having the best land would allow the patrician class to have more opportunities , such as being able to produce better agriculture since society was organized in this way , the patrician class was essentially in complete control of ancient rome 's government in cassius ' accounts of ancient rome , he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class he indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing about the specific shoes the patricians wore for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic a number of patrician families such as the horatii , lucretii , verginii and menenii rarely appear in positions of importance during the later republic many old families had both patrician and plebeian branches , of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity , and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes the distinction between patricians and plebs in ancient rome was based purely on birth although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families , plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy as civil rights for plebeians increased during the middle and late roman republic , many plebeian families had attained wealth and power while some traditionally patrician families had fallen into poverty and obscurity however , once the twelve tables were written down , a law was written which made the marriage between the two classes illegal due to the patricians having the political status , the plebeian class had no representation in the government to advocate for their interests eventually , the plebeian class came together and created their own governing body , the plebeian council this meant , that while the plebeians were able to vote , if the patrician classes voted together , they could control the vote patrician status still carried a degree of prestige at the time of the early roman empire , and roman emperors routinely elevated their supporters to the patrician caste en masse

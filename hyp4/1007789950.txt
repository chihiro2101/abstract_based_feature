according to livy , the first 100 men appointed as senators by romulus were referred to as '' fathers '' ( latin patres ) , and the descendants of those men became the patrician class the appointment of these one hundred men into the senate gave them a noble status this would coincide with the idea that ancient rome was founded on a merit-based ideal according to other opinions , the patricians were those who could point to fathers , i.e 56 other noble families which came to rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate , including several who emigrated from alba longa , after that city was destroyed by tullus hostilius the last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century bc was when the claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to rome in 504 bc , five years after the establishment of the republic the distinction between the noble class , the patricians , and the roman populace , the plebeians , existed from the beginning of ancient rome the patricians were given noble status when named to the senate , giving them wider political influence than the plebs , at least in the times of the early republic the patricians in ancient rome were of the same status as aristocrats in greek society being of the noble class meant that patricians were able to participate in government and politics , while the plebeians could not during the middle and late republic , as this influence gradually eroded , plebeians were granted equal rights in most areas , and even greater in some with the exception of some religious offices which were devoid of political power , plebeians were able to stand for all of the offices that were open to patricians originally patrician , publius clodius pulcher willingly arranged to be adopted by a plebeian family in order to qualify to be appointed as the tribune of the plebs roman republic and empire there was a belief that patricians communicated better with the roman gods , so they alone could perform the sacred rites and take the augury additionally , not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in ancient rome in cassius ' accounts of ancient rome , he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class he indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing about the specific shoes the patricians wore for more on ancient rome 's social class distinction visit social class in ancient rome very few plebeian names appear in lists of roman magistrates during the early republic many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of rome disappeared as rome acquired its empire , and new plebeian families rose to prominence the distinction between patricians and plebs in ancient rome was based purely on birth as civil rights for plebeians increased during the middle and late roman republic , many plebeian families had attained wealth and power while some traditionally patrician families had fallen into poverty and obscurity eventually , the plebeians became unsatisfied with being the lower class and not having the same rights and privileges as the patricians since the patricians were of high social status , they did not want to lose this status ; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status at this time in ancient rome , the monarchy had been over thrown the plebeians wanted to know the laws , which resulted in the written form of laws : the twelve tables even once these laws were written down , and the new centuriate assembly was created , the patrician class remained in power the laws of the roman people : public law in the expansion and decline of the roman republic

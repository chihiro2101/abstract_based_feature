similarly , after saving serbia from annihilation at the turks ' hands in 1876 , russia forced the ottomans to accept a full independent and expanded serbia two years later consequently , russian diplomacy began pressuring the two countries , serbia and bulgaria , to reach a compromise and form an alliance for serbia this was considered catastrophic ; after its hopes of expansion to the north were thwarted due to austro-hungarian annexation of bosnia and herzegovina in october 1908 , serbia now found the last direction of possible expansion , the south , also closing due to the creation of an albanian vilayet serbia 's expansion was to be to the north of this line , including kosovo , and west to the adriatic coast , a territory including the northern half of modern albania , giving serbia access to the sea in essence , serbia was forced to exchange macedonia for albania , an issue that would play a key role in the eventual dissolution of the league in the spring of 1913 , when the great powers insisted upon the creation of the albanian state and denied serbia its territorial gains in that direction bulgaria then turned to the more direct method of expansion through winning a war , building a large army for that purpose and started to see itself as the '' prussia of the balkans '' in the discussions that led greece to join the league , bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on the distribution of territorial gains , unlike the deal with serbia over vardar macedonia the reason was bulgaria 's diplomatic policy of pushing serbia into an agreement limiting her access to macedonia , while at the same time refusing any such agreement with greece the entry of greece in the league however was essential for the allies , since greece , alone among the balkan states in possessing a major fleet , could preclude the mass transfer of ottoman reinforcements from asia directly into europe by sea as the greek ambassador to sofia had put it during the negotiations that led to greece 's entry in the league : '' greece can provide 600,000 men for the war effort the first state to declare war was montenegro , on october 8 , 1912 , starting the first balkan war defeat turned bulgaria into its participation in the first world war on the side of the central powers , since its balkan enemies ( serbia , greece and romania ) were involved in the war on the side of the entente the outcome of the balkan wars caused a permanent break-up of the russo-bulgarian alliance , and left serbia and montenegro as the only allies of russia in this critical region

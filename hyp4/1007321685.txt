as a consequence it started engineering an ambitious plan for indirect expansion through the creation of friendly and closely allied states under russian patronage in the balkan peninsula similarly , after saving serbia from annihilation at the turks ' hands in 1876 , russia forced the ottomans to accept a full independent and expanded serbia two years later consequently , russian diplomacy began pressuring the two countries , serbia and bulgaria , to reach a compromise and form an alliance apart from the russian pressure upon bulgaria and serbia , another issue that triggered the formation of the league was the battle of deçiq of 1911 thus the final agreement between the two countries stipulated that , in the event of a victorious war against the ottomans , bulgaria would receive all of macedonia south of the kriva palanka–ohrid line left bulgaria , on its part , had held a long-term policy regarding the ottomans since resgaining independence during the russo-turkish war the inside story of the peace conference , chapter xv but even so , it was clear that bulgaria could not win a war against the ottomans alone , and an alliance was necessary in the discussions that led greece to join the league , bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on the distribution of territorial gains , unlike the deal with serbia over vardar macedonia the entry of greece in the league however was essential for the allies , since greece , alone among the balkan states in possessing a major fleet , could preclude the mass transfer of ottoman reinforcements from asia directly into europe by sea france , not feeling ready for a war against germany in 1912 , took a totally negative position against the league , firmly informing its ally russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between russia and austro-hungary if it resulted from the actions of the balkan league mounting tensions effectively tore the league apart , and the second balkan war broke out when bulgaria , confident of a quick victory , attacked its former allies serbia and greece defeat turned bulgaria into its participation in the first world war on the side of the central powers , since its balkan enemies ( serbia , greece and romania ) were involved in the war on the side of the entente the outcome of the balkan wars caused a permanent break-up of the russo-bulgarian alliance , and left serbia and montenegro as the only allies of russia in this critical region

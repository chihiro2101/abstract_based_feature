similarly , after saving serbia from annihilation at the turks ' hands in 1876 , russia forced the ottomans to accept a full independent and expanded serbia two years later with the antagonism of the european powers mounting , and smarting from her humiliation by the austrians at the bosnian crisis , russia sought to gain the upper hand by creating a russophile '' slavic block '' in the balkans , directed both against austria-hungary and the ottomans consequently , russian diplomacy began pressuring the two countries , serbia and bulgaria , to reach a compromise and form an alliance in fact , it was a bulgarian-backed organization created with the secret agenda of facilitating the incorporation of thrace ( eastern and western ) and macedonia ( aegean and the vardar ) into a new autonomous state , as an intermediate step before unification with bulgaria could take place in the same way as with eastern rumelia after initial success , serbia and especially greece realized the true purpose of imro and consequently a vicious guerrilla war , the so-called macedonian struggle broke out between bulgarian and greek backed armed groups within ottoman macedonia bulgaria then turned to the more direct method of expansion through winning a war , building a large army for that purpose and started to see itself as the '' prussia of the balkans '' the inside story of the peace conference , chapter xv but even so , it was clear that bulgaria could not win a war against the ottomans alone , and an alliance was necessary in the discussions that led greece to join the league , bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on the distribution of territorial gains , unlike the deal with serbia over vardar macedonia the entry of greece in the league however was essential for the allies , since greece , alone among the balkan states in possessing a major fleet , could preclude the mass transfer of ottoman reinforcements from asia directly into europe by sea france , not feeling ready for a war against germany in 1912 , took a totally negative position against the league , firmly informing its ally russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between russia and austro-hungary if it resulted from the actions of the balkan league the antagonisms between the balkan states still persisted , and after the successful conclusion of the first balkan war , they resurfaced , especially over the partition of macedonia mounting tensions effectively tore the league apart , and the second balkan war broke out when bulgaria , confident of a quick victory , attacked its former allies serbia and greece the outcome of the balkan wars caused a permanent break-up of the russo-bulgarian alliance , and left serbia and montenegro as the only allies of russia in this critical region

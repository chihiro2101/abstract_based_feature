christian was born at frederiksborg castle in denmark on 12 april 1577 as the third child and eldest son of king frederick ii of denmark–norway and sofie of mecklenburg-schwerin he was descended , through his mother 's side , from king john of denmark , and was thus the first descendant of king john to assume the crown since the deposition of king christian ii at the time , denmark was still an elective monarchy , so in spite of being the eldest son christian was not automatically heir to the throne at the death of his father on 4 april 1588 , christian was 11 years old he succeeded to the throne , but as he was still under-age a regency council was set up to serve as the trustees of the royal power while christian was still growing up his mother queen dowager sophie , 30 years old , had wished to play a role in the government , but was denied by the council paul ulff-møller , '' christian 4 in 1595 , the rigsraadet decided that christian would soon be old enough to assume personal control of the reins of government on 17 august 1596 , at the age of 19 , christian signed his haandfæstning ( lit twelve days later , on 29 august 1596 , christian iv was crowned at the church of our lady in copenhagen by the bishop of zealand , peder jensen vinstrup ( 1549–1614 ) he was crowned with a new danish crown regalia which had been made for him by dirich fyring ( 1580–1603 ) , assisted by the nuremberg goldsmith corvinius saur on 30 november 1597 , he married anne catherine of brandenburg , a daughter of joachim friedrich , margrave of brandenburg and duke of prussia christian took an interest in many and varied matters , including a series of domestic reforms and improving danish national armaments new fortresses were constructed under the direction of dutch engineers the danish navy , which in 1596 had consisted of but twenty-two vessels , in 1610 rose to sixty , some of them built after christian 's own designs up until the early 1620s , denmark 's economy profited from general boom conditions in europe this inspired christian to initiate a policy of expanding denmark 's overseas trade as part of the mercantilist wave fashionable in europe he also built a large number of buildings in dutch renaissance style to foster friendly relations between the two kingdoms , christian paid a state visit to england in 1606 despite christian 's many efforts , the new economic projects did not return a profit in 1618 , christian appointed admiral ove gjedde to lead an expedition establish a danish colony in ceylon despite the reluctance of rigsraadet , christian initiated a war with sweden for the supremacy of the baltic sea it was later known as the kalmar war because its chief operation was the danish capture of kalmar , the southernmost fortress of sweden however , despite denmark 's greater strength , the gains of the war were not decisive he skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the german protestants after the battle of white mountain in 1620 , to secure co-adjutorship of the see of bremen for his son frederick ( september 1621 ) christian iv had obtained for his kingdom a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in europe despite the growing power of roman catholics in north germany , and the threat to the danish holdings in the schleswig-holstein duchies , christian for a time stayed his hand he had at his disposal from 19,000 to 25,000 men , and at first gained some successes but on 27 august 1626 he was routed by johan tzerclaes , count of tilly in the battle of lutter christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the holy roman emperor and the catholic league , as promises of military support from the netherlands and england did not materialise christian now formed an alliance with sweden on 1 january 1628 , as he and gustavus adolphus shared the reluctance of german expansion in the baltic region gustavus adolphus pledged to assist denmark with a fleet in case of need , and shortly afterwards a swedo-danish army and fleet compelled wallenstein to raise the siege of stralsund thus with the help of sweden , the superior sea-power enabled denmark to tide over her worst difficulties , and in may 1629 christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the treaty of lübeck , without any diminution of territory however , the treaty bound christian not to interfere in the thirty years ' war any further , removing any danish obstacles when gustavus adolphus entered the war in 1630 christian 's foreign policy did not suffer from lack of confidence following the danish defeat in the thirty years ' war christian contacted the roman catholic part of the thirty years ' war , and offered to broker a deal with sweden the increased sound dues had alienated the dutch , who turned to support sweden this unexpected attack , conducted from first to last with consummate ability and lightning-like rapidity , had a paralysing effect upon denmark christian iv is renowned for his many city ( town ) foundations , and is most likely the nordic head of state that can be accredited for the highest number of new cities in his realm christianshavn , now part of copenhagen , denmark , founded as a fortification/garrison town in 1619 christian iv spoke danish , german , latin , french and italian christian iv is depicted as a foul-natured person , but a good king who did a lot to make his realm flourish , by the danish alternative music band mew in their song , '' king christian '' in 1616 four years after her death the king privately married kirsten munk , by whom he had twelve children leonora christina ulfeldt ( 8 july 1621 – 16 march 1698 ) ; married corfitz ulfeldt count valdemar christian of schleswig-holstein ( 26 june 1622 – 26 february 1656 )

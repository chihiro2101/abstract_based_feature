christian was born at frederiksborg castle in denmark on 12 april 1577 as the third child and eldest son of king frederick ii of denmark–norway and sofie of mecklenburg-schwerin he was descended , through his mother 's side , from king john of denmark , and was thus the first descendant of king john to assume the crown since the deposition of king christian ii at the time , denmark was still an elective monarchy , so in spite of being the eldest son christian was not automatically heir to the throne at the death of his father on 4 april 1588 , christian was 11 years old he succeeded to the throne , but as he was still under-age a regency council was set up to serve as the trustees of the royal power while christian was still growing up it was led by chancellor niels kaas and consisted of the rigsraadet council members peder munk ( 1534–1623 ) , jørgen ottesen rosenkrantz ( 1523–1596 ) and christoffer valkendorff ( 1525-1601 ) his mother queen dowager sophie , 30 years old , had wished to play a role in the government , but was denied by the council christian continued his studies at sorø academy where he had a reputation as a headstrong and talented student in 1595 , the rigsraadet decided that christian would soon be old enough to assume personal control of the reins of government twelve days later , on 29 august 1596 , christian iv was crowned at the church of our lady in copenhagen by the bishop of zealand , peder jensen vinstrup ( 1549–1614 ) he was crowned with a new danish crown regalia which had been made for him by dirich fyring ( 1580–1603 ) , assisted by the nuremberg goldsmith corvinius saur christian had to depend mainly upon hired mercenary troops as was common practice in the times—well before the establishment of standing armies—augmented by native conscription recruited for the most part from the peasantry on the crown domains up until the early 1620s , denmark 's economy profited from general boom conditions in europe this inspired christian to initiate a policy of expanding denmark 's overseas trade as part of the mercantilist wave fashionable in europe he also built a large number of buildings in dutch renaissance style to foster friendly relations between the two kingdoms , christian paid a state visit to england in 1606 the expedition was captained by denmark–norway navigator and explorer , jens munk in 1618 , christian appointed admiral ove gjedde to lead an expedition establish a danish colony in ceylon the expedition set sail in 1618 , taking two years to reach ceylon and losing more than half their crew on the way christian compelled king gustavus adolphus of sweden to give way on all essential points at the resulting treaty of knäred of 20 january 1613 however , despite denmark 's greater strength , the gains of the war were not decisive christian iv had obtained for his kingdom a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in europe & nbsp ; 400–433 denmark 's intervention in the thirty years ' war was aided by france and by charles i of england , who agreed to help subsidise the war partly because christian was the uncle of both the stuart king and his sister elizabeth of bohemia through their mother , anne of denmark some 13,700 scottish soldiers were to be sent as allies to help christian iv under the command of general robert maxwell , 1st earl of nithsdale murdoch and grosjean , pp.43–46 moreover , some 6000 english troops under charles morgan also eventually arrived to bolster the defence of denmark though it took longer for these to arrive than christian hoped , not least due to the ongoing british campaigns against france and spain thus christian , as war-leader of the lower saxon circle , entered the war with an army of only 20,000 mercenaries , some of his allies from britain and a national army 15,000 strong , leading them as duke of holstein rather than as king of denmark despite the growing power of roman catholics in north germany , and the threat to the danish holdings in the schleswig-holstein duchies , christian for a time stayed his hand christian embarked on a military campaign which was later known in denmark and norway as '' the emperor war '' , he had at his disposal from 19,000 to 25,000 men , and at first gained some successes but on 27 august 1626 he was routed by johan tzerclaes , count of tilly in the battle of lutter christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the holy roman emperor and the catholic league , as promises of military support from the netherlands and england did not materialise thus with the help of sweden , the superior sea-power enabled denmark to tide over her worst difficulties , and in may 1629 christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the treaty of lübeck , without any diminution of territory however , the treaty bound christian not to interfere in the thirty years ' war any further , removing any danish obstacles when gustavus adolphus entered the war in 1630 to compensate for lacking export revenues , and also in order to stifle the swedish advances in the thirty years ' war , christian enacted a number of increases in the sound dues throughout the 1630s his scandinavian policy was so irritating and vexatious that swedish statesmen advocated for a war with denmark , to keep christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the holy roman emperor , and in may 1643 , christian faced another war against sweden sweden was able , thanks to their conquests in the thirty years ' war , to attack denmark from the south as well as the east ; the dutch alliance promised to secure them at sea on that day the two fleets encountered at the battle of colberger heide as christian stood on the quarter-deck of the trinity a cannon close by was exploded by a swedish cannonball , and splinters of wood and metal wounded the king in thirteen places , blinding one eye and flinging him to the deck but he was instantly on his feet again , cried with a loud voice that it was well with him , and set every one an example of duty by remaining on deck till the fight was over christian iv spent more time in norway than any other oldenberg monarch and no oldenburg king made such a lasting impression on the norwegian people over the years , fire had destroyed major parts of the city many times , as many of the city 's buildings were built entirely of wood the chapel of christian iv had been completed 6 years before the king died jeg , christian ( 2017 ) is a biographical movie about the last days of christian iv 's life global crisis geoffrey parker in the course of 1628 he discovered that his wife , kirsten munk , was having a relationship with one of his german officers count friedrich christian of schleswig-holstein ( 26 april 1625 – 17 july 1627 )

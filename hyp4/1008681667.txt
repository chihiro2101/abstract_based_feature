through his mother 's side , from king john of denmark , and was thus the first descendant of king john to assume the crown since the deposition of king christian ii at the time , denmark was still an elective monarchy , so in spite of being the eldest son christian was not automatically heir to the throne at the death of his father on 4 april 1588 , christian was 11 years old he succeeded to the throne , but as he was still under-age a regency council was set up to serve as the trustees of the royal power while christian was still growing up his mother queen dowager sophie , 30 years old , had wished to play a role in the government , but was denied by the council paul ulff-møller , '' christian 4 on 17 august 1596 , at the age of 19 , christian signed his haandfæstning ( lit

at the church of our lady in copenhagen by the bishop of zealand , peder jensen vinstrup ( 1549–1614 ) he was crowned with a new danish crown regalia which had been made for him by dirich fyring ( 1580–1603 ) , assisted by the nuremberg goldsmith corvinius saur , wegener , schlewig ( 1596 ) account of christian 's coronation in 1596 : digitised by the british library christian took an interest in many and varied matters , including a series of domestic reforms and improving danish national armaments new fortresses were constructed under the direction of dutch engineers this inspired christian to initiate a policy of expanding denmark 's overseas trade as part of the mercantilist wave fashionable in europe his sister anne had married king james vi of scotland , who succeeded to the english throne in 1603 the ships , searching for the northwest passage , arrived in hudson bay landing at the mouth of churchill river , settling at what is now churchill , manitoba in 1618 , christian appointed admiral ove gjedde to lead an expedition establish a danish colony in ceylon the expedition set sail in 1618 , taking two years to reach ceylon and losing more than half their crew on the way the treaty was signed on 20 november 1620 , establishing danish india despite the reluctance of rigsraadet , christian initiated a war with sweden for the supremacy of the baltic sea it was later known as the kalmar war because its chief operation was the danish capture of kalmar , the southernmost fortress of sweden he now turned his attention to the thirty years ' war in germany he skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the german protestants after the battle of white mountain in 1620 , to secure co-adjutorship of the see of bremen for his son frederick ( september 1621 ) . thirty years ' war lockhart , denmark , 1513–1660 : the rise and decline of a renaissance monarchy ( oxford university press , 2007 ) denmark was funded by tolls on the øresund and also by extensive war-reparations from sweden some 13,700 scottish soldiers were to be sent as allies to help christian iv under the command of general robert maxwell , 1st earl of nithsdale christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the holy roman emperor and the catholic league , as promises of military support from the netherlands and england did not materialise christian now formed an alliance with sweden on 1 january 1628 , as he and gustavus adolphus shared the reluctance of german expansion in the baltic region gustavus adolphus pledged to assist denmark with a fleet in case of need , and shortly afterwards a swedo-danish army and fleet compelled wallenstein to raise the siege of stralsund however , the treaty bound christian not to interfere in the thirty years ' war any further , removing any danish obstacles when gustavus adolphus entered the war in 1630 christian 's foreign policy did not suffer from lack of confidence following the danish defeat in the thirty years ' war he would neither conciliate sweden , henceforth his most dangerous enemy , nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances christian contacted the roman catholic part of the thirty years ' war , and offered to broker a deal with sweden however , his mediating was highly skewed in favour of the holy roman emperor , and was a transparent attempt at minimising the swedish influence in the baltics the increased sound dues had alienated the dutch , who turned to support sweden this unexpected attack , conducted from first to last with consummate ability and lightning-like rapidity , had a paralysing effect upon denmark here denmark had to cede gotland , ösel and ( for thirty years ) halland , while norway lost the two provinces jämtland and härjedalen , giving sweden the supremacy of the baltic sea christian iv spent more time in norway than any other oldenberg monarch and no oldenburg king made such a lasting impression on the norwegian people after the fire in 1624 which lasted for three days , christian iv decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again when christian was crowned king , denmark-norway held a supremacy over the baltic sea , which was lost to sweden during the years of his reign nevertheless , christian was one of the few kings from the house of oldenburg that achieved a lasting legacy of popularity with both the danish and norwegian people christian iv is depicted as a brilliant but hard-drinking monarch in the eric flint and david weber alternate-history novel 1634 : the baltic war

when an aircraft passes through the air , it creates a series of p-wave in front of the aircraft and behind it , similar to the bow wave created by a boat these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and in smooth flight , the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher richard seebass and his colleague albert george at cornell university studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a '' figure of merit '' ( fm ) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft the f-5e was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the f-5f model the quiet spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the low boom flight demonstrator ( lbfd ) , which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing the sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom a sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double '' boom '' as the aircraft is usually some distance away in 1964 , nasa and the federal aviation administration began the oklahoma city sonic boom tests , which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path , progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track for steady supersonic flight , the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude therefore , for a boom to reach the ground , the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom the end of the whip , known as the '' cracker '' , moves faster than the speed of sound , thus creating a sonic boom

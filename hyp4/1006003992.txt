when an aircraft passes through the air , it creates a series of p-wave in front of the aircraft and behind it , similar to the bow wave created by a boat these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and in smooth flight , the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher small aeroplane designs like business jets are favoured and tend to produce minimal to no audible booms ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from to 60,000 feet ( from 12,000 & nbsp ; m to 18,000 & nbsp ; m ) , which is where most sst aircraft were expected to fly this remained untested for decades , until darpa started the quiet supersonic platform project and funded the shaped sonic boom demonstration ( ssbd ) aircraft to test it the ssbd was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics after measuring the 1,300 recordings , some taken inside the shock wave by a chase plane , the ssbd demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third the quiet spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the low boom flight demonstrator ( lbfd ) , which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing the sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom '' n '' wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground for steady supersonic flight , the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude therefore , for a boom to reach the ground , the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom the end of the whip , known as the '' cracker '' , moves faster than the speed of sound , thus creating a sonic boom

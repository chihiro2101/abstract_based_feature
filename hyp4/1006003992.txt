these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and in smooth flight , the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher richard seebass and his colleague albert george at cornell university studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a '' figure of merit '' ( fm ) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft the lower this value , the less boom the aircraft generates , with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from to 60,000 feet ( from 12,000 & nbsp ; m to 18,000 & nbsp ; m ) , which is where most sst aircraft were expected to fly this remained untested for decades , until darpa started the quiet supersonic platform project and funded the shaped sonic boom demonstration ( ssbd ) aircraft to test it the ssbd was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics the quiet spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds the sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom it is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition ; rather , the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom '' n '' wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately for each of altitude ( the width is about five times the altitude ) ; that is , an aircraft flying supersonic at will create a lateral boom spread of about for steady supersonic flight , the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude therefore , for a boom to reach the ground , the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground for example , the speed of sound at is about , but an aircraft must travel at least ( mach 1.12 , where mach 1 equals the speed of sound ) for a boom to be heard on the ground

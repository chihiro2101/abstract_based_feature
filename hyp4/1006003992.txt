when an aircraft passes through the air , it creates a series of p-wave in front of the aircraft and behind it , similar to the bow wave created by a boat these waves travel at the speed of sound and , as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they can not get out of each other 's way quickly enough eventually they merge into a single shock wave , which travels at the speed of sound , a critical speed known as mach 1 , and is approximately at sea level and in smooth flight , the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail because the different radial directions around the aircraft 's direction of travel are equivalent ( given the '' smooth flight '' condition ) , the shock wave forms a mach cone , similar to a vapour cone , with the aircraft at its tip the half-angle \alpha between the direction of flight and the shock wave is given by : : \sin ( \alpha ) \frac in the late 1950s when supersonic transport ( sst ) designs were being actively pursued , it was thought that although the boom would be very large , the problems could be avoided by flying higher fm is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length this remained untested for decades , until darpa started the quiet supersonic platform project and funded the shaped sonic boom demonstration ( ssbd ) aircraft to test it the ssbd was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics although one-third is not a huge reduction , it could have reduced concorde 's boom to an acceptable level below fm 1 the quiet spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the low boom flight demonstrator ( lbfd ) , which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing the sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom it is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition ; rather , the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately for each of altitude ( the width is about five times the altitude ) ; that is , an aircraft flying supersonic at will create a lateral boom spread of about for steady supersonic flight , the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude the end of the whip , known as the '' cracker '' , moves faster than the speed of sound , thus creating a sonic boom

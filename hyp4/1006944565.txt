the term '' the great game '' was used well before the 19th century and was associated with games of risk , such as cards and dice '' the great game '' is attributed to british captain arthur conolly ( 1807–42 ) who had been appointed as a political officer in july 1840 , in correspondence to major henry rawlinson who had been recently appointed as the new political agent in kandahar , conolly wrote , '' you 've a great game , a noble game , before you it was introduced into mainstream by the british novelist rudyard kipling in his novel kim ( 1901 ) davis in a presentation titled the great game in asia ( 1800–1844 ) on 10 november 1926 the use of the term '' the great game '' to describe anglo-russian rivalry in central asia became common only after the second world war during the 19th century a political and diplomatic confrontation developed between britain and russia over afghanistan which later became known as '' the great game '' russia was fearful of british commercial and military inroads into central asia , and britain was fearful of russia adding the '' jewel in the crown '' , india , to the vast empire that russia was building in asia if russia were to gain control of the emirate of afghanistan , it might then be used as a staging post for a russian invasion of india napoleon had proposed a joint franco-russian invasion of india to his imperial majesty paul i of russia in 1801 paul , fearing a future action by the british against russia and her allies in europe , decided to make the first move towards where he believed the british empire was weakest he wrote to the ataman of the don cossacks troops , cavalry general vasily petrovich orlov , directing him to march to orenburg , conquer the central asian khanates , and from there invade india napoleon tried to persuade paul 's son , tsar alexander i of russia , to invade india ; however alexander resisted in response , britain sent its own diplomatic missions in 1808 , with military advisers , to persia and afghanistan under the capable mountstuart elphinstone , averting the french and possible russian threat the expedition was funded by the east india company and was to map and research the regions of '' beloochistan '' ( balochistan ) and persia because of concerns about india being invaded by french forces from that direction the great game is said to have begun on 12 january 1830 when lord ellenborough , the president of the board of control for india tasked lord william bentinck , the governor-general of india , to establish a new trade route to bukhara following the treaty of turkmenchay 1828 and the treaty of adrianople ( 1829 ) , britain feared that persia and the ottoman empire ( now turkey , etc this would change britain 's perception of the world , and its response was the great game behind these buffer states would be their protected states stretching from the persian gulf to india and up into the emirate of afghanistan , with british sea-power protecting trade sea-lanes afghanistan would need to be transformed from a group of warring principalities into one state ruled by an ally whose foreign relations would be conducted on his behalf by the governor-general and the foreign office the great game meant closer ties between britain and the states along her northwest frontier '' here we are , just as we were , snarling at each other , hating each other , but neither wishing for war russia had an interest in establishing a trade route from moscow to india from then until the mid-19th century , russian ambassadors to the region spent much of their time trying to free russians who had been taken as slaves by the khanates russia would later expand across siberia to the far east , where it reached the pacific port that would become known as vladivostok by 1859 this eastward expansion was of no concern to the british foreign office because this area did not lie across any british trade routes or destinations , and therefore was of no interest to britain beginning in the 1820s , russian troops would begin to advance southward from siberia in search of secure boundaries and reliable neighbors this advance would not cease until russia 's frontiers and her sphere of influence were firm in the central asia , and this would include bokhara and khiva russia launched an attack in 1839–40 but it failed to reach khiva because of the tough terrain and weather however , the khan of khiva feared a further russian assault and released a number of russian slaves russian merchants must be allowed to trade on the same terms as native merchants in bukhara and khiva russia 's borders remained insecure and in addition there was growing british influence in the region burnes embarked on a dangerous 12-month journey beginning in 1831 into afghanistan and through the hindu kush to bukhara , returning in 1832 burnes , a christian travelling through a muslim country was one of the first to study afghanistan for british intelligence and upon his return , he published his book , travels to bukhara , which became an overnight success in 1834 while in kabul , he dined with the british envoy , captain alexander burnes , who reported negatively on russia 's intentions russia feared british inroads on their commerce in central asia , as well as the influence that a muslim power with british support might have on the other khanates after its two representatives were executed in bukhara , britain actively discouraged officers from traveling in turkestan in the same year , lieutenant richmond shakespear of the bengal artillery was successful in negotiating the release of 416 russian captives , whom he escorted into russia in 1863 sultan jan of herat , who was placed into power by persia and issued coinage on behalf of the shah , attacked the disputed town of farrah the crimean war had ended in 1856 with russia 's defeat by an alliance of britain , france , and the ottoman empire german chancellor otto von bismarck saw how important the great game had become for russia and britain original title , uk : the great game : on secret service in high asia ingram , edward '' paul 's great game : russia 's plan to invade british india

the '' jewel in the crown '' , india , to the vast empire that russia was building in asia this resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires if russia

interest in establishing a trade route from moscow to india beginning in the 1820s , russian troops would begin to advance southward from siberia in search of secure boundaries and reliable neighbors

failed to reach khiva because of the tough terrain and weather during the 1840s and 1850s , russia 's aims in central asia were for bukhara and khiva to refrain from hostile actions against russia , cease possession of russian slaves and the granting of asylum to kazakhs fleeing from russian justice khiva must cease her attacks on caravans along the syr darya russian merchants must be allowed to

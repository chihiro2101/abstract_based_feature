the term '' the great game '' was used well before the 19th century and was associated with games of risk , such as cards and dice '' the great game '' is attributed to british captain arthur conolly ( 1807–42 ) who had been appointed as a political officer in july 1840 , in correspondence to major henry rawlinson who had been recently appointed as the new political agent in kandahar , conolly wrote , '' you 've a great game , a noble game , before you it was introduced into mainstream by the british novelist rudyard kipling in his novel kim ( 1901 ) the use of the term '' the great game '' to describe anglo-russian rivalry in central asia became common only after the second world war during the 19th century a political and diplomatic confrontation developed between britain and russia over afghanistan which later became known as '' the great game '' russia was fearful of british commercial and military inroads into central asia , and britain was fearful of russia adding the '' jewel in the crown '' , india , to the vast empire that russia was building in asia this resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires if russia were to gain control of the emirate of afghanistan , it might then be used as a staging post for a russian invasion of india in 1801 paul , fearing a future action by the british against russia and her allies in europe , decided to make the first move towards where he believed the british empire was weakest he wrote to the ataman of the don cossacks troops , cavalry general vasily petrovich orlov , directing him to march to orenburg , conquer the central asian khanates , and from there invade india in response , britain sent its own diplomatic missions in 1808 , with military advisers , to persia and afghanistan under the capable mountstuart elphinstone , averting the french and possible russian threat however , britain was left with concerns about being able to defend india the expedition was funded by the east india company and was to map and research the regions of '' beloochistan '' ( balochistan ) and persia because of concerns about india being invaded by french forces from that direction the great game is said to have begun on 12 january 1830 when lord ellenborough , the president of the board of control for india tasked lord william bentinck , the governor-general of india , to establish a new trade route to bukhara following the treaty of turkmenchay 1828 and the treaty of adrianople ( 1829 ) , britain feared that persia and the ottoman empire ( now turkey , etc behind these buffer states would be their protected states stretching from the persian gulf to india and up into the emirate of afghanistan , with british sea-power protecting trade sea-lanes the great game meant closer ties between britain and the states along her northwest frontier britain believed that it was the world 's first free society and the most industrially advanced country , and therefore that it had a duty to use its iron , steam power , and cotton goods to take over central asia and develop it with pay for work and security in place , nomads would settle and become tribal herdsman surrounding oasis cities in 1557 , bokhara and khiva sent ambassadors to ivan iv seeking permission to trade in russia russia had an interest in establishing a trade route from moscow to india russia would later expand across siberia to the far east , where it reached the pacific port that would become known as vladivostok by 1859 this eastward expansion was of no concern to the british foreign office because this area did not lie across any british trade routes or destinations , and therefore was of no interest to britain beginning in the 1820s , russian troops would begin to advance southward from siberia in search of secure boundaries and reliable neighbors this advance would not cease until russia 's frontiers and her sphere of influence were firm in the central asia , and this would include bokhara and khiva russia launched an attack in 1839–40 but it failed to reach khiva because of the tough terrain and weather however , the khan of khiva feared a further russian assault and released a number of russian slaves russia 's borders remained insecure and in addition there was growing british influence in the region in 1869 , when clarendon proposed the amu darya river as the basis for a neutral zone between british and russian spheres of influence , alexander gorchakov proposed afghanistan as the neutral zone he had an interest in expanding trade in central asia , where he thought the russian traders were already active in 1820 , moorcroft , george trebeck and george guthrie left india for bukhara to buy turkoman horses and reached bukhara in 1825 burnes , a christian travelling through a muslim country was one of the first to study afghanistan for british intelligence and upon his return , he published his book , travels to bukhara , which became an overnight success in 1834 in 1835 , lord auckland was appointed governor-general , and replaced bentinck who had pursued a non-intervention policy in 1837 , the russian envoy jan prosper witkiewicz visited kabul , and the british believed that it was to facilitate some form of diplomatic or military presence in afghanistan while in kabul , he dined with the british envoy , captain alexander burnes , who reported negatively on russia 's intentions additionally , persia intended to annex herat to make up for territory it had lost in the russo-persian war ( 1826–28 ) , however the allegiance of herat to afghanistan was crucial to the british strategy british influence was to be extended into afghanistan and it was to become a buffer state following the indian rebellion of 1857 , the east india company 's remaining powers were transferred to the british crown in the person of queen victoria ( who in 1876 was proclaimed emperor of india ) badakhshan would later be divided between afghanistan and russian-controlled bukhara by the pamir boundary commission in 1895 the great game : the struggle for empire in central asia '' paul 's great game : russia 's

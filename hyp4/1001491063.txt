citeseer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time citation statistics and related documents were computed for all articles cited in the database , not just the indexed articles reference linking allowing browsing of the database using citation links because citeseer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata , it returns fewer citation counts than sites , such as google scholar , that have publisher metadata to overcome some of these limitations , a modular and open source architecture for citeseer was designed â€“ citeseer x citeseer x replaced citeseer and all queries to citeseer were redirected citeseer x is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science it continues to support the goals outlined by citeseer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquiry by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations citeseer x crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources , and does not have access to publisher metadata citeseer x data is regularly shared under a creative commons license with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions

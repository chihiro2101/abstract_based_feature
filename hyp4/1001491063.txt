citeseer 's goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document , ranking them by citation impact citeseer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time citeseer was granted a united states patent & nbsp ; 6289342 , titled '' autonomous citation indexing and literature browsing using citation context '' , on september 11 , 2001 because citeseer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata , it returns fewer citation counts than sites , such as google scholar , that have publisher metadata it had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available , usually at an author 's homepage , or those submitted by an author to overcome some of these limitations , a modular and open source architecture for citeseer was designed â€“ citeseer x citeseer x is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science released in 2008 , it was loosely based on the previous citeseer search engine and digital library and is built with a new open source infrastructure , seersuite , and new algorithms and their implementations it continues to support the goals outlined by citeseer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquiry by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations as such citation counts in citeseer x are usually less than those in google scholar and microsoft academic search who have access to publisher metadata

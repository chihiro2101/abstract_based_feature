against the professors '' , a criticism of professors of all arts and sciences , ἑλληνισμός is translated by robert gregg bury as '' hellenism '' ἑλληνισμός is not employed in a religious manner , it is used in context of proper greek grammar the translator , wilmer cave wright rendered ἑλληνισμός as '' hellenic religion '' in the opening sentence where julian complains that '' the hellenic religion does not prosper '' like he desires because of the choice in translation , english speaking polytheists claim julian used the term to define ἑλληνισμός as traditional graeco-roman religion the phrase hellenic polytheistic reconstructionism refers specifically to the methodology used by some practitioners to recreate the religion based on academic sources , rather than the religion

to do with ancient religion at all '' revivalists view hellenic polytheism as a living , changing religion hellenic revivalism allows room for practitioners to decide what feels right to them , and to adapt historical religious practices to modern life most hellenic polytheist groups unequivocally state that reconstructionism is not the only correct method of practicing the ancient greek religion , but do identify a practice as hellenic only when it embraces the humanistic values and ethical virtues of the ancient greeks , demonstrates loyalty and reverence toward the greek gods , and uses a religious structure that would be recognizable to an ancient greek these groups make a clear distinction between themselves and the neopagan movement , and identify some 'hellenic ' groups as ''

there are no official naming practices for labeling religious expressions deriving themselves from the hellenic or hellenistic culture and history in one form or another the ancient hellenes did not have a word for 'religion ' in the modern sense likewise , no greek writer known to us classifies either the gods or the cult practices into separate 'religions ' modern scholarship that speak of religions of the ancient greeks , are applying a modern category in a modern way instead , for example , you see herodotus speak of the hellenes as having '' common shrines of the gods and sacrifices , and the same kinds of customs '' some informal naming conventions have developed since the formation of the first hellenic religious organizations in the 1990s , based on academically accepted descriptive definitions hellenism has be employed as a religious identifier for hellenic religion in the same manner as say christianity is understood to mean christian religion this conflation of hellenism with/as hellenic religion in the anglosphere is the result of english translations of primary sources from antiquity ἑλληνισμός is not employed in a religious manner , it is used in context of proper greek grammar zeno '' , ἑλληνισμός is once again used to talk about greek language , not religion '' '' there are five excellences of speech—pure greek , lucidity , conciseness , appropriateness , distinction the translator , wilmer cave wright rendered ἑλληνισμός as '' hellenic religion '' in the opening sentence where julian complains that '' the hellenic religion does not prosper '' like he desires because of the choice in translation , english speaking polytheists claim julian used the term to define ἑλληνισμός as traditional graeco-roman religion the phrase hellenic polytheistic reconstructionism refers specifically to the methodology used by some practitioners to recreate the religion based on academic sources , rather than the religion itself , and not all hellenic polytheists are reconstructionists other organizations , such as , the ( societas hellenica antiquariorum ) , and the use a combination of terms interchangeably , including , 'hellenic religion ' ) , hellenic polytheistic religion , and hellenism other terms in common usage by hellenic polytheists include '' greek reconstructionism '' and '' hellenic traditionalism '' , but the two are not synonymous prominent concepts include , but are not restricted to : eusebeia ( piety ) , arete ( virtue ) , and xenia ( hospitality ) these are rooted in the various ancient greek values concepts that they look to for guidance and inspiration from the tenets of solon , the delphi maxims , the golden verses of pythagoras , epicurean philosophy , the ethics of aristotle , stoic philosophy and more arete ( ἀρετή ) means virtue , excellence , and moral virtue xenia ( ξενία ) is the concept of hospitality and is sometimes translated as 'guest-friendship ' or 'ritualized

social movement of re-hellenizing greek identity in a comprehensive way , not only religious emically speaking , '' revival '' accurately describes the religious activity occurring in greece ( and its diaspora ) since one of the main hallmarks is group gatherings and public festival celebrations british classicist mary beard dismissed greek worshipers , saying , '' until these eager neo-pagans get real and slaughter a bull or two in central athens , i shan ’ t worry that they have much to do with ancient religion at all '' the bricolage and re-imaginings of contemporary pagans is not entirely different from that of ancient greek religious culture and that even classical scholars inevitably re-imagine the gods '' revivalists view hellenic polytheism as a living , changing religion during the 18th century , several notable authors and freethought embraced ancient greek religion to some extent , studying and translating ancient works of theology and philosophy , and in some cases composing original hymns and devotionals to the ancient greek pantheon during the 1970s , some began to reject the influence of hermeticism and other heavily syncretic forms of greek religion in preference of practices reconstructing earlier or more original forms of hellenic worship in 1993 , a variety of adherents to the hellenic religion in greece and elsewhere came together and began the process of organization the 2004 summer olympics stirred up several disputes concerning hellenic polytheistic religion retrieved february 10 , 2007 , from bbc news despite the 2006 court ruling , the greek ministry of culture and sports continued to disallow ceremonies of any kind at archaeological sites , and some early 21st century hellenic rituals therefore took the form of protests the first greek organization to openly support the religious revival of hellenic religion was ύπατο συμβούλιο των ελλήνων εθνικών ( supreme council of ethnikoi hellenes or ysee ) , established in 1997 , and is publicly active the organization primarily refers to the religion as the '' ethnic polytheistic '' or '' genuine hellenism '' and its practitioners as ethnikoi hellenes , '' ethnic national hellenes

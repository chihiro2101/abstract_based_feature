for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship the growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as florence , venice , nuremberg and bruges , where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique here teams of hundreds of craftsmen , including specialist artists , decorators and engravers , produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from tapestries and furniture to metalwork and coaches , all under the creative supervision of the king 's leading artist charles le brun the emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the industrial revolution in great britain in the mid 18th century the rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made , urbanisation changed patterns of consumerism , the imperialism broadened tastes and diversified markets , and the emergence of a wider middle class created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population product design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design , information design , and interaction design relevant programs include graphic design , interior design , industrial design , architectural technology , and drafting diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide generally , industrial design professionals work in small scale design , rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships industrial design , thames & hudson , 1980 , mayall , wh , industrial design for engineers , london : iliffe books , 1967 , mayall , wh , machines and perception in industrial design , london : studio vista , 1968 , meikle , jeffrey

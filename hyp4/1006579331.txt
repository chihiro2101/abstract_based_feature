for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship the growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as florence , venice , nuremberg and bruges , where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in italy and germany of pattern books : collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products , and whose creation took place in advance of their application the emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the industrial revolution in great britain in the mid 18th century the first use of the term '' industrial design '' is often attributed to the industrial designer joseph claude sinel in 1919 ( although he himself denied this in interviews ) , but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade product design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design , information design , and interaction design relevant programs include graphic design , interior design , industrial design , architectural technology , and drafting diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide generally , industrial design professionals work in small scale design , rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships industrial designers do n't usually design motors , electrical circuits , or gearing that make machines move , but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships

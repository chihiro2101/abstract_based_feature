for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in italy and germany of pattern books : collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products , and whose creation took place in advance of their application the emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the industrial revolution in great britain in the mid 18th century the rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made , urbanisation changed patterns of consumerism , the imperialism broadened tastes and diversified markets , and the emergence of a wider middle class created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population the first use of the term '' industrial design '' is often attributed to the industrial designer joseph claude sinel in 1919 ( although he himself denied this in interviews ) , but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects , ranging from pure art colleges and design schools ( product styling ) , to mixed programs of engineering and design , to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design , to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics , the so-called functionalist school for engineering require accreditation by the accreditation board for engineering and technology ( abet ) in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the national association of schools of art and design ( nasad ) industrial design , thames & hudson , 1980 , mayall , wh , industrial design for engineers , london : iliffe books , 1967 , mayall , wh , machines and perception in industrial design , london : studio vista , 1968 , meikle , jeffrey twentieth century limited : industrial design engineering in america , 1925 - 1939 , philadelphia : temple university press , 1979

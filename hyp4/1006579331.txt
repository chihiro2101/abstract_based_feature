for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in italy and germany of pattern books : collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products , and whose creation took place in advance of their application for instance the deutscher werkbund , founded in 1907 and a precursor to the bauhaus , was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques , to put germany on a competitive footing with great britain and the united states '' the study of those types of technical drawing , according to armengaud , belong to the field of industrial design robert lepper helped to establish one of the country 's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at carnegie institute of technology product design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design , information design , and interaction design various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects , ranging from pure art colleges and design schools ( product styling ) , to mixed programs of engineering and design , to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design , to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics , the so-called functionalist school 249 except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design , the former is considered an applied art while the latter is an applied science industrial design , thames & hudson , 1980 , mayall , wh , industrial design for engineers , london : iliffe books , 1967 , mayall , wh , machines and perception in industrial design , london : studio vista , 1968 , meikle , jeffrey

for several millennia before the onset of industrialisation , design , technical expertise , and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen , who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation , according to their own manual skill , the requirements of their clients , experience accumulated through their own experimentation , and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in italy and germany of pattern books : collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products , and whose creation took place in advance of their application the use of drawing to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by architects and shipwrights during the italian renaissance the emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the industrial revolution in great britain in the mid 18th century the first use of the term '' industrial design '' is often attributed to the industrial designer joseph claude sinel in 1919 ( although he himself denied this in interviews ) , but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade product design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design , information design , and interaction design various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects , ranging from pure art colleges and design schools ( product styling ) , to mixed programs of engineering and design , to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design , to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics , the so-called functionalist school relevant programs include graphic design , interior design , industrial design , architectural technology , and drafting diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide industrial design , thames & hudson , 1980 , mayall , wh , industrial design for engineers , london : iliffe books , 1967 , mayall , wh , machines and perception in industrial design , london : studio vista , 1968 , meikle , jeffrey

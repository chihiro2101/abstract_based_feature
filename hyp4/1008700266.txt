a single path provided by a transmission medium via either physical separation , such as by multipair cable or electrical separation , such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing a storage which can communicate a message over time as well as space the portion of a storage medium , such as a track or band , that is accessible to a given reading or writing station or head in a communications system , the physical or logical link that connects a data source to a data sink examples : marine vhf radio uses some 88 channels in the vhf band for two-way fm voice communication channel 16 , for example , is 156.800 & nbsp ; mhz in the us , seven additional channels , wx1 - wx7 , are allocated for weather broadcasts television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz each channel is 6 & nbsp ; mhz wide the radio channel between an amateur radio repeater and a ham uses two frequencies often 600 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.6 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart the information is carried through the channel by a signal the mathematical model consists of a transition probability that specifies an output distribution for each possible sequence of channel inputs the model may reflect channel performance measures such as bit rate , bit errors , latency/delay , delay jitter , etc multiple access channel : in this channel , multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes from the above 4 basic multi-terminal channels , multiple access channel is the only one whose capacity region is known

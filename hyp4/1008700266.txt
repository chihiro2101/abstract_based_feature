in a communications system , the physical or logical link that connects a data source to a data sink channel 16 , for example , is 156.800 & nbsp ; mhz television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz the radio channel between an amateur radio repeater and a ham uses two frequencies often 600 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.6 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart the information is carried through the channel by a signal statistically , a communication channel is usually modelled as a triple consisting of an input alphabet , an output alphabet , and for each pair ( i , o ) of input and output elements a transition probability p ( i , o ) for example , in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation ( known as fading ) of the transmitted signal , followed by additive noise channel models may be continuous channel models in that there is no limit to how precisely their values may be defined in information theory , it is common to start with memoryless channels in which the output probability distribution only depends on the current channel input a channel model may either be digital ( quantified , e.g in a digital channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as a digital signal at a certain protocol layer interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes the inter-cell interference in the cellular wireless communications is an example of the interference channel a multicast channel is a channel where data is addressed to a group of subscribing users channel capacity channel access method traffic generation model

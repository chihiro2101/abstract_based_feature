a single path provided by a transmission medium via either physical separation , such as by multipair cable or electrical separation , such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing see actor model and process calculi for discussion on the use of channels in a communications system , the physical or logical link that connects a data source to a data sink a specific radio frequency , pair or band of frequencies , usually named with a letter , number , or codeword , and often allocated by international agreement television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz the information is carried through the channel by a signal a channel can be modelled physically by trying to calculate the physical processes which modify the transmitted signal if the attenuation term is complex it also describes the relative time a signal takes to get through the channel channel models may be continuous channel models in that there is no limit to how precisely their values may be defined the mathematical model consists of a transition probability that specifies an output distribution for each possible sequence of channel inputs in a digital channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as a digital signal at a certain protocol layer in an analog channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as an analog signal multiple access channel : in this channel , multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes a multicast channel is a channel where data is addressed to a group of subscribing users

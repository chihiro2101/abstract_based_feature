examples of communications channels include : a connection between initiating and terminating nodes of a circuit channel 16 , for example , is 156.800 & nbsp ; mhz television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz each channel is 6 & nbsp ; mhz wide the radio channel between an amateur radio repeater and a ham uses two frequencies often 600 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.6 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart a channel can be modelled physically by trying to calculate the physical processes which modify the transmitted signal for example , in wireless communications , the channel can be modelled by calculating the reflection of every object in the environment semantically , the transition probability is the probability that the symbol o is received given that i was transmitted over the channel for example , in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation ( known as fading ) of the transmitted signal , followed by additive noise the mathematical model consists of a transition probability that specifies an output distribution for each possible sequence of channel inputs in a digital channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as a digital signal at a certain protocol layer in an analog channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as an analog signal interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes the inter-cell interference in the cellular wireless communications is an example of the interference channel a broadcasting channel is a channel that provides a broadcasting service , i.e

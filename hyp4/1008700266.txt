a single path provided by a transmission medium via either physical separation , such as by multipair cable or electrical separation , such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing see actor model and process calculi for discussion on the use of channels in a communications system , the physical or logical link that connects a data source to a data sink television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz each channel is 6 & nbsp ; mhz wide the radio channel between an amateur radio repeater and a ham uses two frequencies often 600 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.6 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart semantically , the transition probability is the probability that the symbol o is received given that i was transmitted over the channel for example , in wireless communications the channel is often modelled by a random attenuation ( known as fading ) of the transmitted signal , followed by additive noise a channel model may either be digital ( quantified , e.g in an analog channel model , the transmitted message is modelled as an analog signal multiple access channel : in this channel , multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes a broadcasting channel is a channel that provides a broadcasting service , i.e a multicast channel is a channel where data is addressed to a group of subscribing users channel capacity channel access method traffic generation model

examples of communications channels include : a connection between initiating and terminating nodes of a circuit a single path provided by a transmission medium via either physical separation , such as by multipair cable or electrical separation , such as by frequency-division or time-division multiplexing in a communications system , the physical or logical link that connects a data source to a data sink examples : marine vhf radio uses some 88 channels in the vhf band for two-way fm voice communication channel 16 , for example , is 156.800 & nbsp ; mhz television channels such as north american tv channel 2 55.25 & nbsp ; mhz , channel 13 211.25 & nbsp ; mhz the radio channel between an amateur radio repeater and a ham uses two frequencies often 600 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.6 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart a channel can be modelled physically by trying to calculate the physical processes which modify the transmitted signal semantically , the transition probability is the probability that the symbol o is received given that i was transmitted over the channel if the attenuation term is complex it also describes the relative time a signal takes to get through the channel channel models may be continuous channel models in that there is no limit to how precisely their values may be defined in information theory , it is common to start with memoryless channels in which the output probability distribution only depends on the current channel input multiple access channel : in this channel , multiple senders transmit multiple possible different messages over a shared physical medium to one or several destination nodes interference channel : in this channel , two different senders transmit their data to different destination nodes a multicast channel is a channel where data is addressed to a group of subscribing users

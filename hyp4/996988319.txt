the stratford-upon-avon canal connects the worcester and birmingham canal at kings norton to the river avon at stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire it consists of two sections , divided by a junction which connects it to the grand union canal the northern section from kings norton in the suburbs of birmingham to lapworth is level for the first , following the birmingham level , but then descends quite rapidly through the lapworth flight of 18 locks , to reach the junction there is a choice of route to reach the grand union , as there are two locks side by side , one on the main line of the canal , and one on the branch , but a channel joins the bottom ends of both locks the southern section continues the descent with the final seven of the lapworth locks , passing under the m40 motorway just before the final one this nearly-level section contains two of the canal 's three iron aqueducts the easy cruising is interrupted by the wilmcote flight of eleven locks in just over a mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) , soon after which the canal reaches stratford-upon-avon near king 's norton junction there is a disused stop lock , which used to prevent the canal taking water from the worcester and birmingham canal when they were separately owned , but is now left permanently open from kings norton junction at the northern end the canal immediately passes through the unusual king 's norton stop lock , the only guillotine lock stop-lock on a canal it is long , and like many canal tunnels it has no towpath ; horses were walked over the hill and barges were pulled through the tunnel using a handrail on the wall of the tunnel , parts of which can still be seen on the outskirts of shirley the brick-built major 's green aqueduct carries the canal 10m above aqueduct road and the river cole the northern section also has a swing bridge ( no.2 , normally left open ) , a lift bridge ( no.28 ) , and another drawbridge ( no the southern section of the canal passes over three cast iron aqueducts , unusual in that the towpaths are at the level of the canal bottom the second is the wootton wawen aqueduct , just outside wootton wawen , where the canal crosses the a3400 main road an act was passed on 28 march 1793 for the construction of a canal from a junction with the worcester and birmingham canal in kings norton to stratford-upon-avon the route would take it close to warwick and birmingham canal at lapworth , but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it , or with the river avon at stratford for a while the upper river was managed by a syndicate of seven people , all connected with the canal , and the canal company took out a lease of it from 1842 for five years by the 1950s , the southern section was un-navigable by canal boats , as several of the locks could not be operated , and some of the small pounds between the locks of the wilmcote flight were dry retention of the canal was announced on 22 may 1959 , and by 16 october , the british transport commission and the national trust reported that they had agreed on the terms of a lease , under which the national trust would be responsible for the restoration and maintenance of the southern section

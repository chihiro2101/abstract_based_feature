the stratford-upon-avon canal connects the worcester and birmingham canal at kings norton to the river avon at stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire the northern section from kings norton in the suburbs of birmingham to lapworth is level for the first , following the birmingham level , but then descends quite rapidly through the lapworth flight of 18 locks , to reach the junction there is a choice of route to reach the grand union , as there are two locks side by side , one on the main line of the canal , and one on the branch , but a channel joins the bottom ends of both locks the locks are closely spaced until those at preston bagot are reached , after which there is a section with just one lock in the middle this nearly-level section contains two of the canal 's three iron aqueducts the easy cruising is interrupted by the wilmcote flight of eleven locks in just over a mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) , soon after which the canal reaches stratford-upon-avon along the route of the canal , there are a total of 54 narrow locks near king 's norton junction there is a disused stop lock , which used to prevent the canal taking water from the worcester and birmingham canal when they were separately owned , but is now left permanently open from kings norton junction at the northern end the canal immediately passes through the unusual king 's norton stop lock , the only guillotine lock stop-lock on a canal the northern section also has a swing bridge ( no.2 , normally left open ) , a lift bridge ( no.28 ) , and another drawbridge ( no the second is the wootton wawen aqueduct , just outside wootton wawen , where the canal crosses the a3400 main road the stratford-upon-avon canal was conceived as part of a network of canals which would allow coal from the dudley canal and the stourbridge canal to reach oxford and london , without having to use the birmingham canals , the management of which was seen as high-handed an act was passed on 28 march 1793 for the construction of a canal from a junction with the worcester and birmingham canal in kings norton to stratford-upon-avon the route would take it close to warwick and birmingham canal at lapworth , but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it , or with the river avon at stratford negotiations started with the warwick and birmingham , and to second act was obtained on 19 may 1795 , to allow a connecting link to be built , despite rather unfavourable terms imposed on through traffic by the other company for a while the upper river was managed by a syndicate of seven people , all connected with the canal , and the canal company took out a lease of it from 1842 for five years despite difficulties with the state of the canal , and the fact that the accompanying boat provided by the gwr got stuck , the bridge was reached ten years after the re-opening , the queen mother performed the same ceremony for the upper avon navigation , which had been derelict for more than a century , and the canal became part of a through route to the river severn once more the canal was transferred on 1 april 1988 , authorised by an order of the secretary of state , which provided Â£1.5 million , phased over five years , to enable the canal to be brought up to standard

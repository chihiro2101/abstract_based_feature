the stratford-upon-avon canal connects the worcester and birmingham canal at kings norton to the river avon at stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire it consists of two sections , divided by a junction which connects it to the grand union canal the northern section from kings norton in the suburbs of birmingham to lapworth is level for the first , following the birmingham level , but then descends quite rapidly through the lapworth flight of 18 locks , to reach the junction there is a choice of route to reach the grand union , as there are two locks side by side , one on the main line of the canal , and one on the branch , but a channel joins the bottom ends of both locks this nearly-level section contains two of the canal 's three iron aqueducts the easy cruising is interrupted by the wilmcote flight of eleven locks in just over a mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) , soon after which the canal reaches stratford-upon-avon near king 's norton junction there is a disused stop lock , which used to prevent the canal taking water from the worcester and birmingham canal when they were separately owned , but is now left permanently open from kings norton junction at the northern end the canal immediately passes through the unusual king 's norton stop lock , the only guillotine lock stop-lock on a canal further south is the electrically operated shirley draw bridge which carries drawbridge road over the canal the northern section also has a swing bridge ( no.2 , normally left open ) , a lift bridge ( no.28 ) , and another drawbridge ( no on the southern section interesting features of the canal include the unique barrel-roofed lock keeper 's cottages to be found south of kingswood junction the southern section of the canal passes over three cast iron aqueducts , unusual in that the towpaths are at the level of the canal bottom there was once a pipe from the side of the canal that enabled locomotives to draw water to fill the locomotives ' tanks the stratford-upon-avon canal was conceived as part of a network of canals which would allow coal from the dudley canal and the stourbridge canal to reach oxford and london , without having to use the birmingham canals , the management of which was seen as high-handed an act was passed on 28 march 1793 for the construction of a canal from a junction with the worcester and birmingham canal in kings norton to stratford-upon-avon he was also working on the dudley canal 's extension , and another four canal schemes at the same time , and was the first great tunnel engineer the southern section of the canal never realised james ' ambitions , as the upper avon was too tortuous and prone to floods to be a reliable through route by the 1950s , the southern section was un-navigable by canal boats , as several of the locks could not be operated , and some of the small pounds between the locks of the wilmcote flight were dry two canoeists , who had used the canal recently , produced a dated toll ticket for their journey , which was offered as proof that the canal was not disused

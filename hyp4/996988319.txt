the stratford-upon-avon canal connects the worcester and birmingham canal at kings norton to the river avon at stratford-upon-avon in warwickshire it consists of two sections , divided by a junction which connects it to the grand union canal the northern section from kings norton in the suburbs of birmingham to lapworth is level for the first , following the birmingham level , but then descends quite rapidly through the lapworth flight of 18 locks , to reach the junction this nearly-level section contains two of the canal 's three iron aqueducts from kings norton junction at the northern end the canal immediately passes through the unusual king 's norton stop lock , the only guillotine lock stop-lock on a canal it is long , and like many canal tunnels it has no towpath ; horses were walked over the hill and barges were pulled through the tunnel using a handrail on the wall of the tunnel , parts of which can still be seen further south is the electrically operated shirley draw bridge which carries drawbridge road over the canal on the southern section interesting features of the canal include the unique barrel-roofed lock keeper 's cottages to be found south of kingswood junction the southern section of the canal passes over three cast iron aqueducts , unusual in that the towpaths are at the level of the canal bottom travelling south from kingswood junction , the first aqueduct is the modest yarningale aqueduct which carries the canal over a small stream near preston bagot , warwickshire the aqueduct crosses a minor road , the birmingham and north warwickshire railway and also the trackbed of the former alcester railway an act was passed on 28 march 1793 for the construction of a canal from a junction with the worcester and birmingham canal in kings norton to stratford-upon-avon the route would take it close to warwick and birmingham canal at lapworth , but the act did not include any provision for a direct connection with it , or with the river avon at stratford he was also working on the dudley canal 's extension , and another four canal schemes at the same time , and was the first great tunnel engineer he wanted to create a through route between the river severn and the midlands , and so the canal company obtained a further act of parliament on 12 may 1815 , which authorised a connection between the canal and the avon at stratford , as well as enabling them to build reservoirs at earlswood in 1845 , the company agreed to sell the canal to the oxford , worcester and wolverhampton railway , who were also keen to purchase the stratford and moreton tramway the northern section of the canal was saved from dereliction by such pioneering efforts retention of the canal was announced on 22 may 1959 , and by 16 october , the british transport commission and the national trust reported that they had agreed on the terms of a lease , under which the national trust would be responsible for the restoration and maintenance of the southern section the canal was transferred on 1 april 1988 , authorised by an order of the secretary of state , which provided Â£1.5 million , phased over five years , to enable the canal to be brought up to standard

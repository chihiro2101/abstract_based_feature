the main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server , although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use any application that runs and presents its gui in a window , is a client of the display server the display server and its clients communicate with each other over a communications protocol , which is usually called display server protocol , the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user the display server is also responsible for the output of the clients to the computer monitor the output of sound is usually not managed by the display server , but the sound volume is usually handled through gui applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top a display server protocol can be network capable or even network transparent , facilitating the implementation of thin clients a display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system , the hardware , and each other the display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol , a communications protocol , which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable the display server is a key component in any graphical user interface , specifically the windowing system one example of a display server is the x.org server , which runs on top of the kernel ( usually a unix-based kernel , such as linux or bsd ) like any display server , a wayland compositor is responsible for handling input and output for its clients and – in contrast to x11 – additionally for the compositing for apple 's macos family of operating systems , quartz compositor fulfils the tasks of a display server and of a window manager in the windowing system

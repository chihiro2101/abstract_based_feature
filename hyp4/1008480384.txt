the main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server , although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use any application that runs and presents its gui in a window , is a client of the display server the display server and its clients communicate with each other over a communications protocol , which is usually called display server protocol , the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user the display server is also responsible for the output of the clients to the computer monitor the output of sound is usually not managed by the display server , but the sound volume is usually handled through gui applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top the display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol , a communications protocol , which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable the display server is a key component in any graphical user interface , specifically the windowing system one example of a display server is the x.org server , which runs on top of the kernel ( usually a unix-based kernel , such as linux or bsd ) the x.org server is a display server , but in its current implementation it relies on a second program , the compositing window manager , to do the compositing display servers that implement the wayland display server protocol , are called wayland compositors wayland compositors communicate with wayland clients over the wayland display server protocol the display server still gets to decide which window is on top and thus visible to the user and also still is responsible for passing data regarding to input devices from evdev to its clients

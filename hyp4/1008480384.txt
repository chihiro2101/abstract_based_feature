the main component of any windowing system is usually called the display server , although alternative denominations such as window server or compositor are also in use any application that runs and presents its gui in a window , is a client of the display server the display server and its clients communicate with each other over a communications protocol , which is usually called display server protocol , the display server being the mediator between the clients and the user the output of sound is usually not managed by the display server , but the sound volume is usually handled through gui applets and it is the display server who decides which applications are on top a display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system , the hardware , and each other the display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol , a communications protocol , which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable the display server is a key component in any graphical user interface , specifically the windowing system one example of a display server is the x.org server , which runs on top of the kernel ( usually a unix-based kernel , such as linux or bsd ) the x.org server is a display server , but in its current implementation it relies on a second program , the compositing window manager , to do the compositing display servers that implement the wayland display server protocol , are called wayland compositors as of 2017 , it has been replaced with the wayland display server for desktop editions of ubuntu for microsoft windows , from windows vista onward , desktop window manager enables the use of hardware acceleration to render the graphical user interface

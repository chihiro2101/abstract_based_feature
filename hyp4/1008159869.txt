in early 1942 , aeronautical engineer barnes wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking germany 's dams in the hope of crippling german heavy industry wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly , but when he takes his conclusions to the ministry , he is told that lack of production capacity means they can not go ahead with his proposals angry and frustrated , wallis secures an interview with arthur travers harris ( played by basil sydney ) , the head of raf bomber command , who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously bomber command forms a special squadron of lancaster bombers , 617 squadron , to be commanded by wing commander guy gibson , and tasked to fly the mission this requires the drop altitude to be reduced to with only a few weeks to go , he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead wallis later encounters gibson , clearly affected by the loss of the crewmen , but gibson stresses the squadron knew what they were facing but they went in regardless of the odds image : dam busters gibson.jpg thumb 225px richard todd as guy gibson in the dam busters (

of 617 squadron ) , robert clark the head of production at associated british picture corporation ( abpc ) approached its author paul brickhill about acquiring the film rights as a vehicle for richard todd the company 's production manager was , however , of the opinion that , due to its numerous personnel and raids , it would not be able to film the book in its entirety as a result , clark requested that brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film brickhill agreed to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on operation chastise and ignore the later raids after the air ministry agreed to make available four lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable , associated british decided to proceed with the film and agreed with brickhill on the film rights in december 1952 for what is believed to have been £5,000 sherriff was selected as the screenwriter with planned august delivery of the screenplay sherriff agreed with brickhill 's opinion that the film needed to concentrate on operation chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book '' bill '' whittaker on 22 march 1952 to witness wallis demonstrating his original home experiment to wallis 's embarrassment he could n't get it to work , no matter how many times he tried just prior to the film 's scheduled release , guy gibson 's widow eve took legal action to prevent it , and brickhill and clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband 's book enemy coast ahead were included the flight sequences of the film were shot using real avro lancaster bombers supplied by the raf ( an american cut was made more dramatic by depicting an aircraft flying into a hill and exploding this version used stock footage from warner brothers of a boeing b-17 flying fortress , not a lancaster ) the upper derwent valley in derbyshire ( the test area for the real raids ) doubled as the ruhr valley for the film the scene where the dutch coast is crossed was filmed between boston , lincolnshire , and king 's lynn , norfolk , and other coastal scenes near skegness guy gibson had been based at hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational avro lancaster base during the war three of the four lancaster bombers used in the film had also appeared in the dirk bogarde film appointment in london two years earlier the film featured several actors who would go on to be stars of cinema and tv robert shaw was featured as gibson 's engineer flt sgt pulford while george baker played flt lt maltby patrick mcgoohan had a bit part as a security guard , standing guard outside the briefing room he delivered the line— '' sorry , old boy , it 's secret—you ca n't go in the dam busters march , by eric coates , is for many synonymous with the film , as well as with the exploit itself , and remains a favourite military band item at flypasts and in the concert hall other than the introduction and trio section theme , the majority of the march as performed is not featured in the film soundtrack coates only agreed to provide an overture for the film after he was persuaded by the film 's producers it was of '' national importance '' and pressure was put on him via his publisher , chappell the majority of the soundtrack including the theme played during the raid sequence in the film was composed by leighton lucas some of the these scenes were sampled in the film pink floyd – the wall ( 1982 ) in 1999 , british television network itv broadcast a censored version of the film , removing all utterances of '' nigger '' itv blamed regional broadcaster london weekend television , which in turn alleged that a junior staff member had been responsible for the unauthorised cuts in 2020 , film 4 has broadcast an edited version , possibly re-dubbed in a few places , where the dog 's name is removed , addressed as '' old boy '' or referred to as '' my dog '' thumb the film is largely historically accurate , with only a small number of changes made for reasons of artistic license instead of all of gibson 's tour-expired crew at 106 squadron volunteering to follow him to his new command , only his wireless operator , hutchinson , went with him to 617 squadron rather than the purpose as well as the method of the raid being wallis 's sole idea , the dams had already been identified as an important target by the air ministry before the war '' national archives reveals inglorious truth behind classic world war two movies some of the sequences showing the testing of upkeep—the code name for the weapon—in the film are of mosquito fighter-bombers dropping the naval version of the bouncing bomb , code-named highball , intended to be used against ships the british film institute placed the dam busters as the 68th greatest british film the attack on the death star in the climax of the film star wars is a deliberate and acknowledged homage to the climactic sequence of the dam busters the dam busters : a british film guide

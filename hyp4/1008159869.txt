in early 1942 , aeronautical engineer barnes wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking germany 's dams in the hope of crippling german heavy industry working for the minister of aircraft production , as well as his own job at vickers , he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets when it hit the dam , backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall , making the explosion far more destructive wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly , but when he takes his conclusions to the ministry , he is told that lack of production capacity means they can not go ahead with his proposals angry and frustrated , wallis secures an interview with arthur travers harris ( played by basil sydney ) , the head of raf bomber command , who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously bomber command forms a special squadron of lancaster bombers , 617 squadron , to be commanded by wing commander guy gibson , and tasked to fly the mission while they train for the mission , wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems , such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water with only a few weeks to go , he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead wallis later encounters gibson , clearly affected by the loss of the crewmen , but gibson stresses the squadron knew what they were facing but they went in regardless of the odds before they part wallis asks if gibson will finally get some sleep gibson says he can not ; he has to write letters to the dead airmen 's next of kin image : dam busters gibson.jpg thumb 225px richard todd as guy gibson in the dam busters ( 1955 ) image : dam busters redgrave.jpg thumb michael redgrave as barnes wallis in the dam busters ( 1955 ) in credits order following the success of the book the dam busters ( a raf-approved history of 617 squadron ) , robert clark the head of production at associated british picture corporation ( abpc ) approached its author paul brickhill about acquiring the film rights as a vehicle for richard todd as a result , clark requested that brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film brickhill agreed to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on operation chastise and ignore the later raids after the air ministry agreed to make available four lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable , associated british decided to proceed with the film and agreed with brickhill on the film rights in december 1952 for what is believed to have been Â£5,000 forester , terence rattigan , as well as emlyn williams and leslie arliss , r to wallis 's embarrassment he could n't get it to work , no matter how many times he tried just prior to the film 's scheduled release , guy gibson 's widow eve took legal action to prevent it , and brickhill and clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband 's book enemy coast ahead were included the flight sequences of the film were shot using real avro lancaster bombers supplied by the raf the scene where the dutch coast is crossed was filmed between boston , lincolnshire , and king 's lynn , norfolk , and other coastal scenes near skegness guy gibson had been based at hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational avro lancaster base during the war the station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named gibson house the four wartime hangars also still stand , little changed in external appearance since the war '' 'appointment in london ' ( film ) '' patrick mcgoohan had a bit part as a security guard , standing guard outside the briefing room richard thorp played sqn ldr maudslay the dam busters march , by eric coates , is for many synonymous with the film , as well as with the exploit itself , and remains a favourite military band item at flypasts and in the concert hall other than the introduction and trio section theme , the majority of the march as performed is not featured in the film soundtrack the majority of the soundtrack including the theme played during the raid sequence in the film was composed by leighton lucas during world war ii there was a nigger ( dog ) , a black labrador belonging to royal air force wing commander guy gibson , and the mascot of no nigger died on 16 may 1943 , the day of the operation chastise , when he was hit by a car in the film , the dog was portrayed in several scenes ; his name and the codeword were mentioned several times when itv again showed a censored version in june 2001 , it was condemned by the index on censorship as '' unnecessary and ridiculous '' and because the edits introduced continuity errors the british channel 4 screened the censored american version in july 2007 , in which the dialogue was dubbed so as to call the dog '' trigger '' , this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced in september 2007 , as part of the bbc summer of british film series , the dam busters was shown at selected cinemas across the uk in its uncut format thumb the film is largely historically accurate , with only a small number of changes made for reasons of artistic license some errors derive from paul brickhill 's book , which was written when much detail about the raid was not yet in the public domain rather than the purpose as well as the method of the raid being wallis 's sole idea , the dams had already been identified as an important target by the air ministry before the war gibson did not devise the spotlights altimeter after visiting a theatre ; it was suggested by benjamin lockspeiser of the ministry of aircraft production after gibson requested they solve the problem the position and angle of the lake in relation to the castle suggest that in reality the bombing-run would have needed a downhill approach to the west of the castle the british film institute placed the dam busters as the 68th greatest british film jackson said in the mid-1990s that he became interested in remaking the 1955 film , but found that the rights had been bought by mel gibson the attack on the death star in the climax of the film star wars is a deliberate and acknowledged homage to the climactic sequence of the dam busters '' the reason that the dam busters is in the film version of the wall , '' explained the floyd 's roger waters , '' is because i 'm from that generation who grew up in postwar britain , and all those movies were very important to us

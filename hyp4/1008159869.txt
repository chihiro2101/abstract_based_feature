in early 1942 , aeronautical engineer barnes wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking germany 's dams in the hope of crippling german heavy industry working for the minister of aircraft production , as well as his own job at vickers , he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets when it hit the dam , backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall , making the explosion far more destructive wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly , but when he takes his conclusions to the ministry , he is told that lack of production capacity means they can not go ahead with his proposals angry and frustrated , wallis secures an interview with arthur travers harris ( played by basil sydney ) , the head of raf bomber command , who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously bomber command forms a special squadron of lancaster bombers , 617 squadron , to be commanded by wing commander guy gibson , and tasked to fly the mission while they train for the mission , wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems , such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water wallis later encounters gibson , clearly affected by the loss of the crewmen , but gibson stresses the squadron knew what they were facing but they went in regardless of the odds before they part wallis asks if gibson will finally get some sleep image : dam busters gibson.jpg thumb 225px richard todd

dam busters ( a raf-approved history of 617 squadron ) , robert clark the head of production at associated british picture corporation ( abpc ) approached its author paul brickhill about acquiring the film rights as a vehicle for richard todd the company 's production manager was , however , of the opinion that , due to its numerous personnel and raids , it would not be able to film the book in its entirety as a result , clark requested that brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film brickhill agreed to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights to assist him , clark teamed him up with walter mycroft who was the company 's director of production after the air ministry agreed to make available four lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable , associated british decided to proceed with the film and agreed with brickhill on the film rights in december 1952 for what is believed to have been £5,000 sherriff agreed with brickhill 's opinion that the film needed to concentrate on operation chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book '' bill '' whittaker on 22 march 1952 to witness wallis demonstrating his original home experiment to wallis 's embarrassment he could n't get it to work , no matter how many times he tried just prior to the film 's scheduled release , guy gibson 's widow eve took legal action to prevent it , and brickhill and clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband 's book enemy coast ahead were included the flight sequences of the film were shot using real avro lancaster bombers supplied by the raf the aircraft , four of the final production b.viis , had to be taken out of storage and specially modified by removing the mid-upper gun turrets to mimic 617 squadron 's special aircraft , and cost £130 per hour to run , which amounted to a tenth of the film 's costs the scene where the dutch coast is crossed was filmed

in early 1942 , aeronautical engineer barnes wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking germany 's dams in the hope of crippling german heavy industry working for the minister of aircraft production , as well as his own job at vickers , he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets when it hit the dam , backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall , making the explosion far more destructive wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly , but when he takes his conclusions to the ministry , he is told that lack of production capacity means they can not go ahead with his proposals angry and frustrated , wallis secures an interview with arthur travers harris ( played by basil sydney ) , the head of raf bomber command , who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously bomber command forms a special squadron of lancaster bombers , 617 squadron , to be commanded by wing commander guy gibson , and tasked to fly the mission while they train for the mission , wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems , such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water image : dam busters gibson.jpg thumb 225px richard todd as guy gibson in the dam busters ( 1955 )

squadron ) , robert clark the head of production at associated british picture corporation ( abpc ) approached its author paul brickhill about acquiring the film rights as a vehicle for richard todd the company 's production manager was , however , of the opinion that , due to its numerous personnel and raids , it would not be able to film the book in its entirety as a result , clark requested that brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on operation chastise and ignore the later raids after the air ministry agreed to make available four lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable , associated british decided to proceed with the film and agreed with brickhill on the film rights in december 1952 for what is believed to have been Â£5,000 forester , terence rattigan , as well as emlyn williams and leslie arliss , r sherriff agreed with brickhill 's opinion that the film needed to concentrate on operation chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book to wallis 's embarrassment he could n't get it to work , no matter how many times he tried just prior to the film 's scheduled release , guy gibson 's widow eve took legal action to prevent it , and brickhill and clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband 's book enemy coast ahead were included ) the upper derwent valley in derbyshire ( the test area for the real raids ) doubled as the ruhr valley for the film guy gibson had been based at hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational avro lancaster base during the war the station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named gibson house the dam busters march , by eric coates , is for many synonymous with the film , as well as with the exploit itself , and remains a favourite military band item at flypasts and in the concert hall other than the introduction and trio section theme , the majority of the march as performed is not featured in the film soundtrack coates only agreed to provide an overture for the film after he was persuaded by the film 's producers it was of '' national importance '' and pressure was put on him via his publisher , chappell the majority of the soundtrack including the theme played during the raid sequence in the film was composed by leighton lucas during world war ii there was a nigger ( dog ) , a black labrador belonging to royal air force wing commander guy gibson , and the mascot of no gibson owned the dog when he was previously a member of 106 squadron nigger died on 16 may 1943 , the day of the operation chastise , when he was hit by a car in 1999 , british television network itv broadcast a censored version of the film , removing all utterances of '' nigger '' itv blamed regional broadcaster london weekend television , which in turn alleged that a junior staff member had been responsible for the unauthorised cuts '' itv attacked over dam busters censorship the british channel 4 screened the censored american version in july 2007 , in which the dialogue was dubbed so as to call the dog '' trigger '' , this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced in september 2007 , as part of the bbc summer of british film series , the dam busters was shown at selected cinemas across the uk in its uncut format in 2020 , film 4 has broadcast an edited version , possibly re-dubbed in a few places , where the dog 's name is removed , addressed as '' old boy '' or referred to as '' my dog '' some errors derive from paul brickhill 's book , which was written when much detail about the raid was not yet in the public domain instead of all of gibson 's tour-expired crew at 106 squadron volunteering to follow him to his new command , only his wireless operator , hutchinson , went with him to 617 squadron gibson did not devise the spotlights altimeter after visiting a theatre ; it was suggested by benjamin lockspeiser of the ministry of aircraft production after gibson requested they solve the problem the scenes of the attack on the eder dam show a castle resembling schloss waldeck on the wrong side of the lake and dam the position and angle of the lake in relation to the castle suggest that in reality the bombing-run would have needed a downhill approach to the west of the castle in a 1942 paper , wallis mentioned the bouncing of cannonballs in the 16th and 17th centuries , but nelson was not mentioned in the film wallis ( redgrave ) tells gibson and young that a mechanical problem with the release gear has been solved as the engineers had the correct oil in store the dambusters received a royal world premiere at the odeon leicester square on 16 may 1955 , the twelfth anniversary of the raid over time , the film 's reputation has grown and is now regarded as a beloved classic of british cinema in a 2015 review , the guardian stated that the dam busters remains very well made and entertaining les munro , a pilot in the strike team , joined the production crew in masterton as technical advisor '' the reason that the dam busters is in the film version of the wall , '' explained the floyd 's roger waters , '' is because i 'm from that generation who grew up in postwar britain , and all those movies were very important to us the first showed a german guard on top of a dam catching a number of bouncing bombs as if he were a goalkeeper

menander was the last indo-greek king mentioned by ancient historians , and developments after his death are therefore difficult to trace tarn and bopearachchi , is that menander was succeeded by his queen agathokleia , who acted as regent to their infant son strato i until he became an adult and took over the crown after thrason was murdered , competing kings such as zoilos i or lysias may have taken over menander 's kingdom menander 's dynasty was thus dethroned and did not return to power until later , though his relative nicias may have ruled a small principality in the kabul valley at the same time , right after the death of menander , several indo-greek rulers also started to adopt on their coins the pƒÅli title of '' dharmikasa '' , meaning '' follower of the dharma '' ( the title of the great indian buddhist king ashoka was dharmaraja '' king of the dharma '' ) altogether , the conversion of menander to buddhism suggested by the milinda panha seems to have triggered the use of buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him especially , all the kings after menander who are recorded to have ruled in gandhara ( apart from the little-known demetrius iii ) display buddhist symbolism in one form or another although the spread of buddhism to central asia and northern asia is usually associated with the kushans , a century or two later , there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from gandhara '' even earlier , during the time of demetrius and menander '' ( puri , '' buddhism in central asia '' ) around the time , or rather soon after the death of menander , a frieze in sanchi shows buddhist devotees in greek attire this would tend to suggest that the first statues were created between 130 bc ( death of menander ) and 50 bc , precisely at the time when buddhist symbolism appeared on indo-greek coinage

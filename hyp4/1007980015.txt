menander was the last indo-greek king mentioned by ancient historians , and developments after his death are therefore difficult to trace tarn and bopearachchi , is that menander was succeeded by his queen agathokleia , who acted as regent to their infant son strato i until he became an adult and took over the crown according to this scenario , agathokleia and strato i only managed to maintain themselves in the eastern parts of the kingdom , punjab and at times gandhara paropamisadae and pushkalavati were taken over by zoilos i , perhaps because some of agathokleia 's subjects may have been reluctant to accept an infant king with a queen regent senior and other numismatics such as david bivar have suggested that strato i ruled several decades after menander : they point out that strato 's and agathokleia 's monograms are usually different from menander 's , and overstrikes and hoard findings also associates them with later kings after thrason was murdered , competing kings such as zoilos i or lysias may have taken over menander 's kingdom altogether , the conversion of menander to buddhism suggested by the milinda panha seems to have triggered the use of buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him although the spread of buddhism to central asia and northern asia is usually associated with the kushans , a century or two later , there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from gandhara '' even earlier , during the time of demetrius and menander '' ( puri , '' buddhism in central asia '' ) this would tend to suggest that the first statues were created between 130 bc ( death of menander ) and 50 bc , precisely at the time when buddhist symbolism appeared on indo-greek coinage coins of king menander more coins of menander kapisa coinage of menander the debate of king milinda the questions of king milinda catalogue of the coins of menander

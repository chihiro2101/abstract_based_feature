menander was the last indo-greek king mentioned by ancient historians , and developments after his death are therefore difficult to trace senior and other numismatics such as david bivar have suggested that strato i ruled several decades after menander : they point out that strato 's and agathokleia 's monograms are usually different from menander 's , and overstrikes and hoard findings also associates them with later kings menander 's dynasty was thus dethroned and did not return to power until later , though his relative nicias may have ruled a small principality in the kabul valley altogether , the conversion of menander to buddhism suggested by the milinda panha seems to have triggered the use of buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him especially , all the kings after menander who are recorded to have ruled in gandhara ( apart from the little-known demetrius iii ) display buddhist symbolism in one form or another both because of his conversion and because of his unequaled territorial expansion , menander may have contributed to the expansion of buddhism in central asia although the spread of buddhism to central asia and northern asia is usually associated with the kushans , a century or two later , there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from gandhara '' even earlier , during the time of demetrius and menander '' ( puri , '' buddhism in central asia '' ) the anthropomorphic representation of the buddha is absent from indo-greek coinage , suggesting that the indo-greek kings may have respected the indian an-iconic rule for depictions of the buddha , limiting themselves to symbolic representation only this would tend to suggest that the first statues were created between 130 bc ( death of menander ) and 50 bc , precisely at the time when buddhist symbolism appeared on indo-greek coinage coins of king menander more coins of menander kapisa coinage of menander the debate of king milinda the questions of king milinda catalogue of the coins of menander

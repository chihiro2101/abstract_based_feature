1825 : conveying marquis de lafayette to france from july 1824 to september 1825 , the last surviving french general of the revolutionary war , the marquis de lafayette , made a famous tour of the 24 states in the united states at many stops on this tour , he was received by the populace with a hero 's welcome , and many honors and monuments were presented to commemorate and memorialize lafayette 's visit susquehanna—a 44-gun frigate—was laid down on september 20 , 1821 , at the washington navy yard shortly before she was to be launched in the spring of 1825 , president john quincy adams decided to have an american warship carry the marquis de lafayette back to europe , in the wake of his visit to the land he had fought to free almost 50 years before the general had expressed his intention of sailing for home sometime in the late summer or early autumn of 1825 adams selected susquehanna for this honor , and accordingly—as a gesture of the nation 's affection for lafayette—the frigate was renamed brandywine to commemorate the battle of brandywine , in which lafayette was wounded fighting with american forces as an honor to the marquis , officers were selected from as many states as possible and , where practicable , from descendants of persons who had distinguished themselves in the american revolution after fitting out at the navy yard , the frigate traveled down the potomac river to await her passenger at st lafayette enjoyed a last state dinner to celebrate his 68th birthday on the evening of september 6 and then embarked in the steamboat mount vernon on september 7 for the trip downriver to join brandywine on september 8 , the frigate stood out of the potomac river and sailed down chesapeake bay toward the open ocean brandywine left le havre that same day to join the united states ' mediterranean squadron en route , she stopped at cowes on the isle of wight in england to re-caulk seams that had opened rather badly during the atlantic crossing then , after being rendered more seaworthy , she resumed her voyage to gibraltar on october 22 , reaching the famed british bastion guarding the mediterranean sea 's atlantic entrance on november 2 following an 11-day passage , the trio reached mahón , minorca ; and brandywine spent the next three months refitting she directed her efforts to protecting american citizens , especially merchant seamen who were being impressed into service by the peruvian navy ballard in command , the warship set out for the gulf of mexico two months later to gather information concerning conditions in that area at first , this deployment was devoted almost exclusively to sailing from one peaceful port to the next , showing the flag to maintain and enhance american prestige while napoleon 's brother , joseph bonaparte , sat on the throne there , naples had seized several american merchantmen ; and the most recent successor to the throne , king ferdinand ii , had repudiated the debts on september 13 , brandywine set sail for the brazil station where she cruised for more than three years protecting united states interests in the region later moved to norfolk , she also assumed the role of receiving ship for the squadron brandywine was also the very first warship ever built with an innovative stern which reduced the chronic vulnerability of the traditional square stern ship to enemy fire and allowed her to carry stern-mounted guns

on 12 october 1936 , the spanish civil war had been underway for just under three months ; the celebration of columbus day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the university of salamanca , including enrique pla y deniel , the archbishop of salamanca , and carmen polo , the wife of franco , falangist general josé millán astray and unamuno himself unamuno had supported franco 's uprising because he believed it necessary to bring order to the anarchy created by the popular front , and that day he was representing general franco in the event by then the republican government had removed unamuno from his perpetual rectory at the salamanca university and the rebel government had restored him according to the british historian hugh thomas in his masterpiece the spanish civil war ( 1961 ) , the evening began with an impassioned speech by the falangism writer josé maría pemán '' from somewhere in the auditorium , someone cried out the spanish legion´s motto '' ¡viva la muerte ! '' long live death ! as was his habit , millán astray , the founder and first commander of the spanish legion , responded with '' ¡españa ! '' spain ! ; the crowd replied with '' ¡una ! '' one ! unamuno , who was presiding over the meeting , rose up slowly and addressed the crowd : unamuno gestured to the archbishop of salamanca , millán astray responded : '' death to intelligence ! long live death ! '' provoking applause from the falangists '' millán astray , controlling himself , shouted '' take the lady 's arm ! '' unamuno took carmen polo by the arm and left under her protection severiano delgado , a historian and librarian at the university of salamanca , asserts that unamuno 's words were put in his mouth by luis portillo , in 1941 , possibly with some help from george orwell , in a piece in the literary magazine horizon , entitled unamuno 's last lecture severiano delgado 's book , titled '' archeology of a myth : the act of october 12 , 1936 in the auditorium of the university of salamanca , '' shows how the propaganda myth arose regarding the confrontation that took place that day between miguel de unamuno and the general millán astray delgado agrees that a '' very fierce and violent verbal confrontation '' between unamuno and millán astray definitely occurred , which led to unamuno being removed from his rectorship , but he thinks that the famous speech attributed to unamuno was invented and written by luis portillo '' delgado says that : unamuno took the floor , not to confront millán astray , but to answer a previous speech by professor of literature francisco maldonado who had identified catalonia and the basque country with the '' antispaña as proof that the incident was nothing more than a crossroads of hard words , the photograph reproduced on the cover of his book shows millán astray and miguel de unamuno calmly saying goodbye in the presence of bishop plà , with no tension between them the photo was discovered in 2018 in the national library and was part of the chronicle of the act that the newspaper '' the advancement of salamanca '' published the following day , 13 october 1936 however , research by and , released in 2020 , suggests that he may have been murdered by bartolomé aragón , the last person to have visited him , based on the fact that he falsely claimed to be a former student of his , was a fascist militant ( and requete ) with opposed political ideas to unamuno and had collaborated with nationals propaganda before el espejo de la muerte ( the mirror of death ) ( 1913 ) & nbsp ; — a collection of stories niebla ( mist ) ( 1914 ) & nbsp ; — one of unamuno 's key works , which he called a nivola to distinguish it from the supposedly fixed form of the novel ( novela in spanish ) vida de don quijote y sancho ( usually translated into english as our lord don quixote ) ( 1914 ) & nbsp ; — another key work of unamuno , often perceived as one of the earliest works applying existential elements to don quixote the book , on unamuno 's own admission , is of mixed genre with elements of personal essay , philosophy , and fiction unamuno felt that miguel de cervantes had not told the story of don quijote very well , cluttering it with unrelated tales '' tragic sense of life , i the man of flesh and bone he provides a stimulating discussion of the differences between faith and reason in his most famous work : del sentimiento trágico de la vida ( the tragic sense of life , 1912 ) unamuno 's conception of liberalism , elaborated in essays such as la esencia del liberalismo in 1909 , was one that sought to reconcile a great respect for individual freedom with a more interventionist state , bringing him to a position closer to social liberalism in the final analysis unamuno 's significance is that he was one of a number of notable interwar intellectuals , along with luminaries such as julien benda , karl jaspers , johan huizinga , and josé ortega y gasset , who resisted the intrusion of ideology into western intellectual life

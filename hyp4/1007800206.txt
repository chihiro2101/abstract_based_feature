nuclear terrorism could include : acquiring or fabricating a nuclear weapon fabricating a dirty bomb attacking a nuclear reactor , e.g the creation of a device that may give information about the configuration of components needed for a nuclear weapon former u.s president barack obama called nuclear terrorism '' the single most important national security threat that we face '' security council , president obama said that '' just one nuclear weapon exploded in a city -- be it new york or moscow , tokyo or beijing , london or paris -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people '' robert oppenheimer , about the possibility of detecting a smuggled atomic bomb : this sparked further work on the question of smuggled atomic devices during the 1950s by the mid-1980s the power stations may easily be turning out 200,000 & nbsp ; lb of the stuff each year and the new york times commented in 1981 that the nuclear emergency search team 's '' origins go back to the aftershocks of the munich olympic massacre in mid-1972 until that time , no one in the united states government had thought seriously about the menace of organized , international terrorism , much less nuclear terrorism there was a perception in washington that the value of what is called 'special nuclear material ' - plutonium or highly enriched uranium ( heu ) - was so enormous that the strict financial accountability of the private contractors who dealt with it would be enough to protect it from falling into the wrong hands but it has since been revealed that the physical safeguarding of bomb-grade material against theft was almost scandalously neglected this discussion took on a larger public character in the 1980s after nbc aired special bulletin , a television dramatization of a nuclear terrorist attack on the united states the world institute for nuclear security is an organization which seeks to prevent nuclear terrorism and improve world nuclear security wins was formed in 2008 , less than a year after a break-in at the pelindaba nuclear facility in south africa , which contained enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs the global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism ( gicnt ) is an international partnership of 88 nations and 5 official observers working to improve capacity on a national and international level for prevention , detection , and response to a nuclear terrorist event partners join the gicnt by endorsing the statement of principles , a set of broad nuclear security objectives and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small , crude nuclear weapon by a militant group in a major city , with significant loss of life and property it is feared that a terrorist group could detonate a dirty bomb , a type of radiological weapon there would be no nuclear blast and likely no fatalities , but the radioactive material is dispersed and can cause extensive fallout depending on the material used there are other radiological weapons called radiological exposure devices where an explosive is not necessary al-qaeda has sought nuclear weapons for almost two decades by attempting to purchase stolen nuclear material and weapons and has sought nuclear expertise on numerous occasions however , nuclear experts regarded the threat as insignificant in october 2015 it was reported that moldovan authorities working with the fbi have stopped four attempts from 2010 to 2015 by gangs with suspected connections to russia 's intelligence services that sought to sell radioactive material to isis and other middle eastern extremists the last reported case came in february 2015 when a smuggler with a large amount of radioactive caesium specifically sought a buyer from isis since relations between russia and the west have deteriorated , it is difficult to know whether smugglers are succeeding in selling radioactive material originating from russia to islamist terrorists and elsewhere in april 2016 , european union and nato security chiefs warned that isis are plotting to carry out nuclear attacks on the united kingdom and europe similar to al-qaeda , these groups ’ activities have been hampered by counter-terrorism activity ; nevertheless they remain committed to launching such a devastating attack within russia the japanese terror cult aum shinrikyo , which used sarin in the 1995 tokyo metro attack , has also tried to acquire nuclear weapons information reported to the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) shows '' a persistent problem with the illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials , thefts , losses and other unauthorized activities '' however , the then director general ispr athar abbas said the claims were '' factually incorrect '' , adding that the sites were '' military facilities , not nuclear installations '' there have been incidents where individuals such as david hahn ( a former boy scout known for trying to build a nuclear reactor ) and others have been initially charged under the relevant legislation due to the extent of contamination but the charges later withdrawn either due to lack of evidence or other reasons in 2009 , a paper published in west point military academy 's journal alleged that pakistan 's nuclear sites had been attacked by al-qaeda and the taliban at least three times in january 2010 , it was revealed that the us army was training a specialised unit '' to seal off and snatch back '' pakistani nuclear weapons in the event that militants would obtain a nuclear device or materials that could make one '' pakistan nuclear weapons at risk of theft by terrorists , us study warns , the guardian , 2010-04-12 in 2016 , defense intelligence agency director vincent r stewart said that pakistan '' continues to take steps to improve its nuclear security , and is aware of the threat presented by extremists to its program '' the region has more violent extremists than any other , the country is unstable , and its arsenal of nuclear weapons is expanding '' could terrorists get hold of a nuclear bomb ? , bbc , 2010-04-12 in 2015 , white house press secretary josh earnest said that the us has confidence that pakistan is '' well aware of the range of potential threats to its nuclear arsenal '' official : terrorists seek nuclear material , but lack ability to use it , cnn , 2010-04-13 in 2015 , richard g a 2016 study by the congressional research service titled 'pakistan 's nuclear weapons ' , noted that pakistan 's '' initiatives , such as strengthened export control laws , improved personnel security , and international nuclear security cooperation programs , have improved pakistan 's nuclear security '' during the 2020 armenian–azerbaijani skirmishes azerbaijan threatened to launch missile attacks on the armenian nuclear power plant while in office , president barack obama reviewed homeland security policy and concluded that '' attacks using improvised nuclear devices bush and senator john kerry both agreed that the most serious danger facing the united states is the possibility that terrorists could obtain a nuclear bomb assistant secretary of defense during the clinton administration , wrote that “ on the current path , a nuclear terrorist attack on america in the decade ahead is more likely than not '' in 2006 , robert galluccii , dean of the school of foreign service , estimated that , “ it is more likely than not that al-qaeda or one of its affiliates will detonate a nuclear weapon in a u.s there is no credible evidence that any terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear bomb or the materials needed to make one in this scenario , uncontrolled fires would burn for days and emergency services and hospitals would be completely overwhelmed “ the goal would be twofold : first , to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons ; second , to give every leader the incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials focus on nuclear terrorism , '' the fear of terrorist transfer of nuclear weapons seems greatly exaggerated many of the shortcomings of the washington nuclear security summit were addressed at the seoul nuclear security summit in march 2012

nuclear terrorism could include : acquiring or fabricating a nuclear weapon fabricating a dirty bomb attacking a nuclear reactor , e.g the creation of a device that may give information about the configuration of components needed for a nuclear weapon former u.s president barack obama called nuclear terrorism '' the single most important national security threat that we face '' security council , president obama said that '' just one nuclear weapon exploded in a city -- be it new york or moscow , tokyo or beijing , london or paris -- could kill hundreds of thousands of people '' robert oppenheimer , about the possibility of detecting a smuggled atomic bomb : this sparked further work on the question of smuggled atomic devices during the 1950s in 1975 the economist warned that '' you can make a bomb with a few pounds of plutonium '' '' nuclear terrorism , '' the economist ( january 25 , 1975 ) p until that time , no one in the united states government had thought seriously about the menace of organized , international terrorism , much less nuclear terrorism there was a perception in washington that the value of what is called 'special nuclear material ' - plutonium or highly enriched uranium ( heu ) - was so enormous that the strict financial accountability of the private contractors who dealt with it would be enough to protect it from falling into the wrong hands this discussion took on a larger public character in the 1980s after nbc aired special bulletin , a television dramatization of a nuclear terrorist attack on the united states in 1986 a private panel of experts known as the international task force on the prevention of terrorism released a report urging all nuclear-armed states to beware the dangers of terrorism and work on equipping their nuclear arsenals with permissive action links costello , '' experts warn on nuclear terror , '' courier-mail ( june 26 , 1986 ) wins was formed in 2008 , less than a year after a break-in at the pelindaba nuclear facility in south africa , which contained enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs and there is concern about the possible detonation of a small , crude nuclear weapon by a militant group in a major city , with significant loss of life and property averting catastrophe : why the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is losing its deterrence capacity and how to restore it may 22 , 2007 , p there would be no nuclear blast and likely no fatalities , but the radioactive material is dispersed and can cause extensive fallout depending on the material used in osama bin laden 's only interview with a journalist after the september 11 attacks , he and ayman al-zawahiri claimed that al-qaeda possessed readily usable chemical and nuclear weapons however it is generally believed , including by the interviewer hamid mir , that they were bluffing and that it would have been extremely unlikely for al-qaeda to have procured weapons of mass destruction at that time according to leaked diplomatic documents , al-qaeda can produce radiological weapons , after sourcing nuclear material and recruiting rogue scientists to build '' dirty bombs '' al-qaeda , along with some north caucasus terrorist groups that seek to establish an islamic caliphate in russia , have consistently stated they seek nuclear weapons and have tried to acquire them al-qaeda has sought nuclear weapons for almost two decades by attempting to purchase stolen nuclear material and weapons and has sought nuclear expertise on numerous occasions osama bin laden stated that the acquisition of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction is a “ religious duty ” while pressure from a wide range of counter-terrorist activity has hampered al-qaeda 's ability to manage such a complex project , there is no sign that it has jettisoned its goals of acquiring fissile material the islamic state of iraq and syria ( isis ) has demonstrated ambition to use weapons of mass destruction although the chances of them obtaining a nuclear bomb are small , the group have been trying/suspected of trying to obtain a nuclear dirty bomb in a letter to un secretary-general ban ki-moon , iraq 's un ambassador mohamed ali alhakim said that the materials had been kept at the university and '' can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction '' international atomic energy agency spokeswoman gill tudor said that the seized materials were '' low grade and would not present a significant safety , security or nuclear proliferation risk '' in march 2016 , it was reported that a senior belgian nuclear official was being monitored by isis suspects linked to the november 2015 paris attacks leading the belgian federal agency for nuclear control to suspect that isis was planning on abducting the official to obtain nuclear materials for a dirty bomb they have also engaged in reconnaissance activities on nuclear storage facilities and have repeatedly threatened to sabotage nuclear facilities similar to al-qaeda , these groups ’ activities have been hampered by counter-terrorism activity ; nevertheless they remain committed to launching such a devastating attack within russia information reported to the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) shows '' a persistent problem with the illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials , thefts , losses and other unauthorized activities '' the iaea illicit nuclear trafficking database notes 1,266 incidents reported by 99 countries over the last 12 years , including 18 incidents involving heu or plutonium trafficking : there have been 18 incidents of theft or loss of highly enriched uranium ( heu ) and plutonium confirmed by the iaea in november 2006 , mi5 warned that al-qaida were planning on using nuclear weapons against cities in the united kingdom by obtaining the bombs via clandestine means in november 2006 , the alexander litvinenko poisoning with radioactive polonium '' represents an ominous landmark : the beginning of an era of nuclear terrorism , '' according to andrew j '' ushering in the era of nuclear terrorism , '' by patterson , andrew j he was instead convicted of charges that he conspired to '' murder , kidnap and maim '' people overseas a study by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university titled '' securing the bomb 2010 , '' found that pakistan 's stockpile '' faces a greater threat from islamic terror groups seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth '' pakistan nuclear weapons at risk of theft by terrorists , us study warns , the guardian , 2010-04-12 in 2016 , defense intelligence agency director vincent r stewart said that pakistan '' continues to take steps to improve its nuclear security , and is aware of the threat presented by extremists to its program '' '' could terrorists get hold of a nuclear bomb ? , bbc , 2010-04-12 in 2015 , white house press secretary josh earnest said that the us has confidence that pakistan is '' well aware of the range of potential threats to its nuclear arsenal '' official : terrorists seek nuclear material , but lack ability to use it , cnn , 2010-04-13 in 2015 , richard g a 2016 study by the congressional research service titled 'pakistan 's nuclear weapons ' , noted that pakistan 's '' initiatives , such as strengthened export control laws , improved personnel security , and international nuclear security cooperation programs , have improved pakistan 's nuclear security '' led by the national technical nuclear forensics center , attribution would allow the government to determine the likely source of nuclear material used in the event of a nuclear attack the exercises were carried out at a training center in indiana , and were set up to '' simulate the aftermath of a small nuclear bomb blast , set off in a u.s global threat reduction initiative ( gtri ) was established in order to consolidate nuclear stockpiles of highly enriched uranium ( heu ) , plutonium , and assemble nuclear weapons at fewer locations “ the goal would be twofold : first , to deter leaders of nuclear states from selling weapons to terrorists by holding them accountable for any use of their own weapons ; second , to give every leader the incentive to tightly secure their nuclear weapons and materials president obama , along with nearly fifty world leaders , discussed the threat of nuclear terrorism , what steps needed to be taken to mitigate illicit nuclear trafficking , and how to secure nuclear material many of the shortcomings of the washington nuclear security summit were addressed at the seoul nuclear security summit in march 2012

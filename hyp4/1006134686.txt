bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s in 1955 eastman kodak used mylar as a support for photographic film and called it '' estar base '' the very thin and tough film allowed reels to be exposed on long-range u-2 reconnaissance flights the most common way of doing this is the sequential process , in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction , i.e once the drawing is completed , the film is '' heat set '' or crystallized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above the heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about if it were produced without any additives , the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up , similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked to make handling possible , microscopic inert inorganic particles are usually embedded in the pet to roughen the surface of the film such as silicon dioxide biaxially oriented pet film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium , gold , or other metal onto it for some applications like food packaging , the aluminized bopet film can be laminated with a layer of polyethylene , which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance uses for bopet polyester films include , but are not limited to : laminates containing metallized bopet foil ( in technical language called printin or laminate web substrate ) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss , achieving long shelf life metallized bopet film space blanket conserve a shock victim 's body heat fire proximity suit used by fire fighters for protection from the high amount of heat release from fuel fires aluminized , as an inexpensive solar eclipse viewer , although care must be taken , because invisible fissures can form in the metal film , reducing its effectiveness metallized bopet film , along with other plastic films , is used as a dielectric in foil capacitors although '' blueprint '' duplication has fallen out of use , mylar is still used for its archival properties , typically as a record set of plans for building departments to keep on file

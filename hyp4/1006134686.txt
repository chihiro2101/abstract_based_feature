bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s the very thin and tough film allowed reels to be exposed on long-range u-2 reconnaissance flights in 1964 , nasa launched echo ii , a diameter balloon constructed from a thick mylar film sandwiched between two layers of thick aluminium foil bonded together thumb the manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) being extruded onto a chill roll , which quenches it into the amorphous state once the drawing is completed , the film is '' heat set '' or crystallized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about biaxially oriented pet film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium , gold , or other metal onto it the result is much less permeable to gases ( important in food packaging ) and reflects up to 99 % of light , including much of the infrared spectrum for some applications like food packaging , the aluminized bopet film can be laminated with a layer of polyethylene , which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance the polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the bopet side shiny white bopet web substrate is used as lidding for dairy goods such as yogurt clear bopet web substrate is used as lidding for fresh or frozen ready meals due to its excellent heat resistance , it can remain on the package during microwave or oven heating roasting bags metallised films laminated sheet metal ( aluminium or steel ) used in the manufacture of cans ( bisphenol a-free alternative to lacquers ) spacecraft are insulated with a metallized bopet film clear and white bopet films are used as core layers and overlays in smart cards before the widespread adoption of cad , engineering drawings or architectural drawings were plotted onto sheets of bopet film , known as drafting film transparency ( projection ) for photocopiers or laser printers ( bopet film withstands the high heat )

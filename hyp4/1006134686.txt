bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s in 1955 eastman kodak used mylar as a support for photographic film and called it '' estar base '' the very thin and tough film allowed reels to be exposed on long-range u-2 reconnaissance flights thumb the manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) being extruded onto a chill roll , which quenches it into the amorphous state orthogonally to the direction of travel , in a heated oven it is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously , although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate once the drawing is completed , the film is '' heat set '' or crystallized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above the heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about to make handling possible , microscopic inert inorganic particles are usually embedded in the pet to roughen the surface of the film such as silicon dioxide for some applications like food packaging , the aluminized bopet film can be laminated with a layer of polyethylene , which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance the polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the bopet side shiny other coatings , such as conductive indium tin oxide ( ito ) , can be applied to bopet film by sputter deposition uses for bopet polyester films include , but are not limited to : roasting bags metallised films laminated sheet metal ( aluminium or steel ) used in the manufacture of cans ( bisphenol a-free alternative to lacquers ) metallized bopet film , along with other plastic films , is used as a dielectric in foil capacitors clear and white bopet films are used as core layers and overlays in smart cards transparency ( projection ) for photocopiers or laser printers ( bopet film withstands the high heat )

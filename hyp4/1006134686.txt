bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s in 1955 eastman kodak used mylar as a support for photographic film and called it '' estar base '' the very thin and tough film allowed reels to be exposed on long-range u-2 reconnaissance flights thumb the manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) being extruded onto a chill roll , which quenches it into the amorphous state the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about if it were produced without any additives , the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up , similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked to make handling possible , microscopic inert inorganic particles are usually embedded in the pet to roughen the surface of the film such as silicon dioxide biaxially oriented pet film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium , gold , or other metal onto it the polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the bopet side shiny other coatings , such as conductive indium tin oxide ( ito ) , can be applied to bopet film by sputter deposition white bopet web substrate is used as lidding for dairy goods such as yogurt clear bopet web substrate is used as lidding for fresh or frozen ready meals roasting bags metallised films laminated sheet metal ( aluminium or steel ) used in the manufacture of cans ( bisphenol a-free alternative to lacquers ) bopet films are often annealed to a glass element to improve thermal conductivity , and guarantee the necessary flat surface needed for even telescopic solar observation bopet film is often used as the diaphragm material in headphones , electrostatic loudspeakers and microphones bopet film is used as the substrate in practically all magnetic tapes and floppy disks transparency ( projection ) for photocopiers or laser printers ( bopet film withstands the high heat ) pvc was previously used for this , but over long periods of time pvc can release chlorine , which reacts with the silver and copper in coins

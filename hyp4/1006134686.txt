bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s originally by dupont , imperial chemical industries ( ici ) , and hoechst in 1955 eastman kodak used mylar as a support for photographic film and called it '' estar base '' in 1964 , nasa launched echo ii , a diameter balloon constructed from a thick mylar film sandwiched between two layers of thick aluminium foil bonded together thumb the manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) being extruded onto a chill roll , which quenches it into the amorphous state the most common way of doing this is the sequential process , in which the film is first drawn in the machine direction using heated rollers and subsequently drawn in the transverse direction , i.e it is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously , although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate the heat setting step prevents the film from shrinking back to its original unstretched shape and locks in the molecular orientation in the film plane the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about if it were produced without any additives , the surface of the film would be so smooth that layers would adhere strongly to one another when the film is wound up , similar to the sticking of clean glass plates when stacked to make handling possible , microscopic inert inorganic particles are usually embedded in the pet to roughen the surface of the film such as silicon dioxide biaxially oriented pet film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium , gold , or other metal onto it other coatings , such as conductive indium tin oxide ( ito ) , can be applied to bopet film by sputter deposition laminates containing metallized bopet foil ( in technical language called printin or laminate web substrate ) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss , achieving long shelf life bopet film has been used in the production of banjo & drumheads since 1958 due to its durability and acoustical properties when stretched over the bearing edge of the drum bopet film is used as the substrate in practically all magnetic tapes and floppy disks before the widespread adoption of cad , engineering drawings or architectural drawings were plotted onto sheets of bopet film , known as drafting film transparency ( projection ) for photocopiers or laser printers ( bopet film withstands the high heat )

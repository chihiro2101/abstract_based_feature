bopet film was developed in the mid-1950s , izard , emmette farr , '' production of polyethylene terephthalate '' , u.s adams , john francis edward ; gerber , kenneth george ; holmes-walker , william anthony , '' process for the production of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film '' , u.s in 1955 eastman kodak used mylar as a support for photographic film and called it '' estar base '' thumb the manufacturing process begins with a film of molten polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) being extruded onto a chill roll , which quenches it into the amorphous state it is also possible to draw the film in both directions simultaneously , although the equipment required for this is somewhat more elaborate once the drawing is completed , the film is '' heat set '' or crystallized under tension in the oven at temperatures typically above the orientation of the polymer chains is responsible for the high strength and stiffness of biaxially oriented pet film , which has a typical young 's modulus of about as a result , biaxially oriented pet film has excellent clarity , despite its semicrystalline structure biaxially oriented pet film can be metallized by vapor deposition of a thin film of evaporated aluminium , gold , or other metal onto it for some applications like food packaging , the aluminized bopet film can be laminated with a layer of polyethylene , which provides sealability and improves puncture resistance the polyethylene side of such a laminate appears dull and the bopet side shiny uses for bopet polyester films include , but are not limited to : laminates containing metallized bopet foil ( in technical language called printin or laminate web substrate ) protect food against oxidation and aroma loss , achieving long shelf life clear bopet web substrate is used as lidding for fresh or frozen ready meals roasting bags metallised films laminated sheet metal ( aluminium or steel ) used in the manufacture of cans ( bisphenol a-free alternative to lacquers ) an electrical insulation material insulation for houses and tents , reflecting thermal radiation five layers of metallized bopet film in nasa 's spacesuits make them radiation resistant and help regulate temperature metallized bopet film , along with other plastic films , is used as a dielectric in foil capacitors the bopet sheets become legal documents from which copies or blueprints are made transparency ( projection ) for photocopiers or laser printers ( bopet film withstands the high heat )

considering that the entropy of written english is less than 1.1 bits per character , passphrases can be relatively weak the equation employed here is : : 4 bits ( 1st character ) + 14 bits ( characters 2 & ndash ; 8 ) + 18 bits ( characters 9 & ndash ; 20 ) + 3 bits ( characters 21 & ndash ; 23 ) + 6 bits ( bonus for upper case , lower case , and alphanumeric ) 45 bits ( this calculation does not take into account that this is a well-known quote from the operetta h.m.s an md5 hash of this passphrase can be cracked in 4 seconds using crackstation.net , indicating that the phrase is found in password cracking databases ) using this guideline , to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security ( non-military ) by nist , a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long , assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric for example , the characters in five-letter words each contain 2.3 bits of entropy , which would mean only a 35-character passphrase is necessary to achieve 80 bit strength if the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack however , the required effort ( in time and cost ) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and how randomly they are chosen and ordered in the passphrase these are difficult conditions to meet , and selecting at least one word that can not be found in any dictionary significantly increases passphrase strength on the other hand , user-selected passwords tend to be much weaker than that and encouraging users to use even 2-word passphrases may be able to raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits one method to create a strong passphrase is to use dice to select words at random from a long list , a technique often referred to as diceware for example , if there are 7776 words in the list and six words are chosen randomly , then there are 7776 6 & nbsp ; 221073919720733357899776 combinations , providing about 78 bits of entropy

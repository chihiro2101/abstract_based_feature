an md5 hash of this passphrase can be cracked in 4 seconds using crackstation.net , indicating that the phrase is found in password cracking databases ) using this guideline , to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security ( non-military ) by nist , a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long , assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric for example , the characters in five-letter words each contain 2.3 bits of entropy , which would mean only a 35-character passphrase is necessary to achieve 80 bit strength if the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack however , the required effort ( in time and cost ) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and how randomly they are chosen and ordered in the passphrase on the other hand , user-selected passwords tend to be much weaker than that and encouraging users to use even 2-word passphrases may be able to raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits where the password data ( hopefully ) can not be extracted ) but passwords are typically not safe to use as keys for standalone security systems ( e.g however , if a passphrase is not protected appropriately by the authenticator and the clear-text passphrase is revealed its use is no better than other passwords when used in cryptography , commonly the password protects a long ( machine generated ) key , and the key protects the data one method to create a strong passphrase is to use dice to select words at random from a long list , a technique often referred to as diceware for example , if there are 7776 words in the list and six words are chosen randomly , then there are 7776 6 & nbsp ; 221073919720733357899776 combinations , providing about 78 bits of entropy

since the principle of delegatus non-potest delegare has not achieved rigid standing in canada , the qr & os authorize other military officials to generate orders having similar , but not equal , status these instruments can be found in the canadian forces administrative orders and defence administrative orders and directives ; they are used as direction for authorities within the cf to administer the day-to-day considerations of the forces for example , officer cadets attending military college are organized and subject to regulations more appropriate for their academic success than the enforcement of discipline , as might be expected of fully trained members volume iv , appendix 6.1 of the queen 's regulations and orders for the canadian military colleges ( qr canmilcols ) applies the branch interprets the canadian forces ' own internal rules and code of discipline , and also international and humanitarian laws and codes of war , such as the geneva conventions the finnish military law concerns the members of the finnish defence forces and the finnish border guard the military jurisdiction encompasses all military persons : conscripts , students training for a paid military position , females serving voluntarily and paid military personnel however , military chaplains are outside the criminal military jurisdiction the military jurisdiction starts from the moment when a person reports to duty or was liable to report to duty and lasts to the moment when the person has been discharged from service and , in case of conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists , has also left the military area during wartime , also civilians serving in the defence forces or in civilian institutions that have been put under the direction of defence forces are under military jurisdiction like in germany , persons under military jurisdiction are under the usual civilian criminal law the military criminal law , the 45th chapter of the penal code , encompasses only the crimes which only military persons can commit ( act on maintenance of military discipline and crime fighting in the defence forces ) ] however , they are only under military jurisdiction if the crime has been committed against another military person or against the defence forces unlike other crimes , the military crimes have separate sentence ranges for peace and wartime for example , desertion carries , in the peacetime , a sentence of disciplinary punishment or up to one year in prison when the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime , and the crime carries fine as a punishment , a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law when the crime falls under military jurisdiction , it is usually investigated by the serviceman 's own unit when the company commander or his superior feels that the crime is non-trivial and requires professional investigation , they may submit the issue to the defence command for investigation during peacetime , professional soldiers ( with the exception of certain soldiers deployed to international missions ) can not be given other disciplinary punishment than a public letter of reprimand or a fine if the superior does not feel that his powers allow him to give sufficient punishment , he will transfer the matter to the next higher superior when the brigade commander determines that he can not give sufficient punishment , he will transfer the matter to the public prosecutor who will commence prosecution in a civilian court the brigade commander 's decision can be appealed to the district court within seven days the military crimes that go to court are handled by civilian courts that have military members the district court has a learned civilian judge and two military members the supreme court of finland has two officers with at least colonel 's rank as members when handling military crimes the military members of the district court are selected by the court of appeals on the motion of the commander of the finnish army the military members of the courts of appeals are selected by the ministry of justice on motion of the ministry of defence when the military person holds a permanent or temporary paid position as a state military servant , as all officers and ncos in regular active service do , they will be sentenced to dismissal in addition to other punishments , if they are convicted of a military or a civilian crime for more than two years in prison and there are no special grounds for leniency if the military person is no longer in service , the summary disciplinary procedure can not be used and the military has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue in such cases , the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members in addition to judicial dismissal , the defence forces and the border guard have the option of administratively ending the military person 's service if the person is in a paid position soldiers that violate military regulations may also receive penalties in form of non-judicial punishment or in severe cases judicial punishments by a special type of court the judge of such a court is a civil one , two military officers are attending every case and act as consultants to the judge he will remain in arrest for the same time but continue serving in his unit on duty times unless the court has imposed further limits the armed forces act 2006 replaces the three separate service discipline acts and earlier armed forces acts as the system of law under which the armed forces operate

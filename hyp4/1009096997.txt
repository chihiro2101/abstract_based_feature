since the principle of delegatus non-potest delegare has not achieved rigid standing in canada , the qr & os authorize other military officials to generate orders having similar , but not equal , status these instruments can be found in the canadian forces administrative orders and defence administrative orders and directives ; they are used as direction for authorities within the cf to administer the day-to-day considerations of the forces for example , officer cadets attending military college are organized and subject to regulations more appropriate for their academic success than the enforcement of discipline , as might be expected of fully trained members volume iv , appendix 6.1 of the queen 's regulations and orders for the canadian military colleges ( qr canmilcols )

persons can commit the military has a jurisdiction to investigate all military crimes proper , and also a number of other crimes that have been specifically listed as belonging to the military jurisdiction however , they are only under military jurisdiction if the crime has been committed against another military person or against the defence forces unlike other crimes , the military crimes have separate sentence ranges for peace and wartime during wartime , the crimes carry considerably larger sentence ranges and , if the crime causes the danger to the military unit , the sentence range is even harsher when the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime , and the crime carries fine as a punishment , a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law the battalion commander and military police officers have also the right to arrest the suspect and to conduct searches inside a military area when the brigade commander determines that he can not give sufficient punishment , he will transfer the matter to the public prosecutor who will commence prosecution in a civilian court the military crimes that go to

persons , the penal code provides for the loss of military rank the legislator has purposefully given the military superiors the legal tools by which to maintain discipline by punishing even the slight appearances of bad conduct if they feel it necessary the judge of such a court is a civil one , two military officers are attending every case and act as consultants to the judge the military

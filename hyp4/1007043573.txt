an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks in endemic regions , coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20 % of cases of community-acquired pneumonia notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection this can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the meninges , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough ( sometimes productive of mucus ) , fevers , night sweats and weight loss after coccidioides infection , coccidioidomycosis begins with valley fever , which is its initial acute form valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis therefore , coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types : : acute coccidioidomycosis , sometimes described in literature as primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis : chronic coccidioidomycosis : disseminated coccidioidomycosis , which includes primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis this happens when the soil is disturbed often by clearing trees , construction and farming the more land that is cleared , the more arid the soil , the riper the environment for coccidioides on arriving in alveoli , they enlarge in size to become spherules , and internal septations develop this division of cells is made possible by the optimal temperature inside the body rupture of spherules release these endospores , which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual on rare occasion it can enter the body through a break in the skin , causing infection with specific nucleotide primers , c.immitis dna can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) it can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with c.immitis rna an indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal antigen or host igm or igg antibody produced against the fungus the available tests include the tube-precipitin ( tp ) assays , complement fixation test , and elisa if the meninges are affected , csf will show csf glucose , an increased level of protein , and lymphocytic pleocytosis chest x-rays rarely demonstrate nodules or cavities in the lungs , but these images commonly demonstrate lung opacification , pleural effusions , or lymphadenopathy associated with the lungs preventing valley fever is challenging because it is difficult to avoid breathing in the fungus should it be present ; however , the public health effect of the disease is essential to understand in areas where the fungus is endemic enhancing surveillance of coccidioidomycosis is key to preparedness in the medical field in addition to improving diagnostics for early infections currently there are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through valley fever -endemic areas recommended preventive measures include avoiding airborne dust or dirt , but this does not guarantee protection against infection that were logged into the notifiable disease united states research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who are aware of the disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for coccidioidomycosis greater construction activity may disturb spores in the soil however , coccidioides immitis was never weaponized to the public 's knowledge , and most of the military research in the mid-1960s was concentrated on developing a human vaccine in 2002 , coccidioides posadasii was identified as genetically distinct from coccidioides immitis despite their morphologic similarities and can also cause coccidioidomycosis image : spherule and endospore forms of coccidioides immitis 01ee057 lores.jpg image : mature spherule with endospores of coccidioides immitis phil 480.tif

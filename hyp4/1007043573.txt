an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks in endemic regions , coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20 % of cases of community-acquired pneumonia notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection this can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the meninges , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough ( sometimes productive of mucus ) , fevers , night sweats and weight loss osteomyelitis , including involvement of the spine , and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection severe lung disease may develop in hiv-infected persons after coccidioides infection , coccidioidomycosis begins with valley fever , which is its initial acute form valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis serious complications may occur in patients who have weakened immune systems , including severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistulas requiring resection , lung nodules , and possible disseminated form , where the infection spreads throughout the body the disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body , causing skin ulcers , abscesses , bone lesions , swollen joints with severe pain , heart inflammation , urinary tract problems , and meningitis , which can lead to death it must rain first to start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus underneath the soil the more land that is cleared , the more arid the soil , the riper the environment for coccidioides rupture of spherules release these endospores , which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual these cavities can result in symptoms like pleurisy , hemoptysis , and persistent cough coccidioidomycosis diagnosis relies on a combination of an infected person 's signs and symptoms , findings on radiographic imaging , and laboratory results an indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal antigen or host igm or igg antibody produced against the fungus chest x-rays rarely demonstrate nodules or cavities in the lungs , but these images commonly demonstrate lung opacification , pleural effusions , or lymphadenopathy associated with the lungs currently there are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through valley fever -endemic areas research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who are aware of the disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for coccidioidomycosis currently , recommended prevention measures can include type-of-exposure-based respirator protection for persons engaged in agriculture , construction and others working outdoors in endemic areas dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil , and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions there is a lack of prospective studies that examine optimal antifungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis on the whole , oral fluconazole and intravenous amphotericin b are used in progressive or disseminated disease , or in immunocompromised individuals intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin b therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to the common flu , pneumonia , and other respiratory diseases , it is important for public health professionals to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis conventional amphotericin b desoxycholate ( amb : used since the 1950s as a primary agent ) is known to be associated with increased drug-induced nephrotoxicity ( kidney toxicity ) impairing renal function in addition , the effect of altitude on fungi growth and morphology has not been studied , and altitude can range from sea level to 10,000 feet or higher across california , arizona , utah and new mexico women who are pregnant and immediately postpartum are at a high risk of infection and dissemination as of 2013 , there is no vaccine available to prevent infection with coccidioides immitis or coccidioides posadasii , but efforts to develop such a vaccine are underway

an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks in endemic regions , coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20 % of cases of community-acquired pneumonia notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection this can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the meninges , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) osteomyelitis , including involvement of the spine , and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection severe lung disease may develop in hiv-infected persons after coccidioides infection , coccidioidomycosis begins with valley fever , which is its initial acute form valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis the disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body , causing skin ulcers , abscesses , bone lesions , swollen joints with severe pain , heart inflammation , urinary tract problems , and meningitis , which can lead to death over a prolonged dry period , cells within hyphae degenerate to form alternating barrel-shaped cells ( arthroconidia ) this happens when the soil is disturbed often by clearing trees , construction and farming the more land that is cleared , the more arid the soil , the riper the environment for coccidioides rupture of spherules release these endospores , which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual coccidioidomycosis diagnosis relies on a combination of an infected person 's signs and symptoms , findings on radiographic imaging , and laboratory results tp antibody is specific and is used as a confirmatory test , whereas elisa is sensitive and thus used for initial testing if the meninges are affected , csf will show csf glucose , an increased level of protein , and lymphocytic pleocytosis preventing valley fever is challenging because it is difficult to avoid breathing in the fungus should it be present ; however , the public health effect of the disease is essential to understand in areas where the fungus is endemic recommended preventive measures include avoiding airborne dust or dirt , but this does not guarantee protection against infection states do not require reporting of coccidioidomycosis , the actual numbers can be higher the united states ' centers for disease control and prevention called the disease a '' silent epidemic '' and acknowledged that there is no proven anticoccidioidal vaccine available studies done in the past show that the cost benefit of a vaccine is most notable among infants , teens , and immigrant adults , with negative cost-benefit results among older age groups currently , recommended prevention measures can include type-of-exposure-based respirator protection for persons engaged in agriculture , construction and others working outdoors in endemic areas amphotericin b used to be the only available treatment , although now there are alternatives , including itraconazole or ketoconazole , that may be used for milder disease intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin b therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment the antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis the latter was not as effective in one study as amphotericin b desoxycholate which had a 50 % murine morbidity rate versus zero for the amb colloidal dispersion the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the united states in 2011 ( 42.6 per 100,000 ) was almost ten times higher than the incidence reported in 1998 ( 5.3 per 100,000 ) in retrospect , smith played a major role in both medical research and raising awareness about coccidioidomycosis , especially when he became dean of the school of public health at the university of california at berkeley in 1951 in 2002 , coccidioides posadasii was identified as genetically distinct from coccidioides immitis despite their morphologic similarities and can also cause coccidioidomycosis as of 2013 , there is no vaccine available to prevent infection with coccidioides immitis or coccidioides posadasii , but efforts to develop such a vaccine are underway

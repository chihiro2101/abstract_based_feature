an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection this can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the meninges , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) chronic infection is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough ( sometimes productive of mucus ) , fevers , night sweats and weight loss osteomyelitis , including involvement of the spine , and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection after coccidioides infection , coccidioidomycosis begins with valley fever , which is its initial acute form therefore , coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types : : acute coccidioidomycosis , sometimes described in literature as primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis : chronic coccidioidomycosis : disseminated coccidioidomycosis , which includes primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis the disseminated form of coccidioidomycosis can devastate the body , causing skin ulcers , abscesses , bone lesions , swollen joints with severe pain , heart inflammation , urinary tract problems , and meningitis , which can lead to death it must rain first to start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus underneath the soil on rare occasion it can enter the body through a break in the skin , causing infection coccidioidomycosis diagnosis relies on a combination of an infected person 's signs and symptoms , findings on radiographic imaging , and laboratory results the fungal infection can be demonstrated by microscopic detection of diagnostic cells in body fluids , exudates , sputum and biopsy tissue by methods of papanicolaou or grocott 's methenamine silver staining it can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with c.immitis rna an indirect demonstration of fungal infection can be achieved also by serologic analysis detecting fungal antigen or host igm or igg antibody produced against the fungus the available tests include the tube-precipitin ( tp ) assays , complement fixation test , and elisa tp antibody is specific and is used as a confirmatory test , whereas elisa is sensitive and thus used for initial testing enhancing surveillance of coccidioidomycosis is key to preparedness in the medical field in addition to improving diagnostics for early infections currently there are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through valley fever -endemic areas the use of air filtration indoors is also helpful , in addition to keeping skin injuries clean and covered to avoid skin infection the united states ' centers for disease control and prevention called the disease a '' silent epidemic '' and acknowledged that there is no proven anticoccidioidal vaccine available those with severe symptoms may benefit from antifungal therapy , which requires 3–6 months or more of treatment depending on the response to the treatment there is a lack of prospective studies that examine optimal antifungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis amphotericin b used to be the only available treatment , although now there are alternatives , including itraconazole or ketoconazole , that may be used for milder disease because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to the common flu , pneumonia , and other respiratory diseases , it is important for public health professionals to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis immitis is endemic to southern and central california with the highest presence in the san joaquin valley the first case of what was later named coccidioidomycosis was described in 1892 in buenos aires by alejandro posadas , a medical intern at the hospital de clínicas '' josé de san martín '' they decided that the causative organism was a coccidia-type protozoan and named it coccidioides immitis ( resembling coccidia , not mild ) in 2002 , coccidioides posadasii was identified as genetically distinct from coccidioides immitis despite their morphologic similarities and can also cause coccidioidomycosis centers for disease control and prevention page on coccidioidomycosis medline plus entry for coccidioidomycosis

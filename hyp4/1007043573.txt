an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks in endemic regions , coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20 % of cases of community-acquired pneumonia notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection this can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the meninges , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough ( sometimes productive of mucus ) , fevers , night sweats and weight loss osteomyelitis , including involvement of the spine , and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection severe lung disease may develop in hiv-infected persons after coccidioides infection , coccidioidomycosis begins with valley fever , which is its initial acute form valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis therefore , coccidioidomycosis may be divided into the following types : : acute coccidioidomycosis , sometimes described in literature as primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis : chronic coccidioidomycosis : disseminated coccidioidomycosis , which includes primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis it must rain first to start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus underneath the soil on arriving in alveoli , they enlarge in size to become spherules , and internal septations develop in individuals with a weakened immune system , the infection can spread fungemia coccidioidomycosis diagnosis relies on a combination of an infected person 's signs and symptoms , findings on radiographic imaging , and laboratory results with specific nucleotide primers , c.immitis dna can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) it can also be detected in culture by morphological identification or by using molecular probes that hybridize with c.immitis rna states do not require reporting of coccidioidomycosis , the actual numbers can be higher the united states ' centers for disease control and prevention called the disease a '' silent epidemic '' and acknowledged that there is no proven anticoccidioidal vaccine available raising both surveillance and awareness of the disease while medical researchers are developing a human vaccine can positively contribute towards prevention efforts research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who are aware of the disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for coccidioidomycosis dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil , and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions significant disease develops in fewer than 5 % of those infected and typically occurs in those with a weakened immune system there is a lack of prospective studies that examine optimal antifungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person 's bones and joints because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to the common flu , pneumonia , and other respiratory diseases , it is important for public health professionals to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis greyhound dogs often get coccidioidomycosis as well , and their treatment regimen involves 6â€“12 months of ketoconazole , to be taken with food in arizona , for instance , in 2007 , there were 3,450 cases in maricopa county , which in 2007 had an estimated population of 3,880,181 u.s greater construction activity may disturb spores in the soil in 2002 , coccidioides posadasii was identified as genetically distinct from coccidioides immitis despite their morphologic similarities and can also cause coccidioidomycosis centers for disease control and prevention page on coccidioidomycosis medline plus entry for coccidioidomycosis

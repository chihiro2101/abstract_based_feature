an estimated 60 % of people infected with the fungi responsible for coccidioidomycosis have minimal to no symptoms , while 40 % will have a range of possible clinical symptoms of those who do develop symptoms , the primary infection is most often respiratory , with symptoms resembling bronchitis or pneumonia that resolve over a matter of a few weeks in endemic regions , coccidioidomycosis is responsible for 20 % of cases of community-acquired pneumonia notable coccidioidomycosis signs and symptoms include a profound fatigue ( medical ) , loss of smell and taste , fever , cough , headaches , rash , myalgia , and arthralgia the classic triad of coccidioidomycosis known as '' desert rheumatism '' includes the combination of fever , joint pains , and erythema nodosum a minority ( 3 % -5 % ) of infected individuals do not recover from the initial acute infection and develop a chronic infection this can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the meninges , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough ( sometimes productive of mucus ) , fevers , night sweats and weight loss osteomyelitis , including involvement of the spine , and meningitis may occur months to years after initial infection severe lung disease may develop in hiv-infected persons after coccidioides infection , coccidioidomycosis begins with valley fever , which is its initial acute form valley fever may progress to the chronic form and then to disseminated coccidioidomycosis it must rain first to start the cycle of initial growth of the fungus underneath the soil rupture of spherules release these endospores , which in turn repeat the cycle and spread the infection to adjacent tissues within the body of the infected individual coccidioidomycosis diagnosis relies on a combination of an infected person 's signs and symptoms , findings on radiographic imaging , and laboratory results these stains can demonstrate spherules and surrounding inflammation chest x-rays rarely demonstrate nodules or cavities in the lungs , but these images commonly demonstrate lung opacification , pleural effusions , or lymphadenopathy associated with the lungs currently there are no completely effective preventive measures available for people who live or travel through valley fever -endemic areas recommended preventive measures include avoiding airborne dust or dirt , but this does not guarantee protection against infection in 1998-2011 , there were 111,117 cases of coccidioidomycosis in the u.s research demonstrates that patients from endemic areas who are aware of the disease are most likely to request diagnostic testing for coccidioidomycosis dust control measures such as planting grass and wetting the soil , and also limiting exposure to dust storms are advisable for residential areas in endemic regions those with severe symptoms may benefit from antifungal therapy , which requires 3â€“6 months or more of treatment depending on the response to the treatment on the whole , oral fluconazole and intravenous amphotericin b are used in progressive or disseminated disease , or in immunocompromised individuals amphotericin b used to be the only available treatment , although now there are alternatives , including itraconazole or ketoconazole , that may be used for milder disease intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin b therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to the common flu , pneumonia , and other respiratory diseases , it is important for public health professionals to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the united states in 2011 ( 42.6 per 100,000 ) was almost ten times higher than the incidence reported in 1998 ( 5.3 per 100,000 ) following the 1994 northridge earthquake , there was a sudden increase of cases in the areas affected by the quake , at a pace of over 10 times baseline they decided that the causative organism was a coccidia-type protozoan and named it coccidioides immitis ( resembling coccidia , not mild ) coccidioides immitis was considered by the united states during the 1950s and 1960s as a potential biological weapon as of 2013 , there is no vaccine available to prevent infection with coccidioides immitis or coccidioides posadasii , but efforts to develop such a vaccine are underway in cats , symptoms may include skin lesions , fever , and loss of appetite , with skin lesions being the most common

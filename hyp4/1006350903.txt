film speed measurement systems the speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees ' warnerke ( sometimes seen as warn ) corresponding with the last number visible on the exposed plate after development and fixation each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° warnerke at the time his system saw some success but proved to be unreliable due to its spectral sensitivity to light , the fading intensity of the light emitted by the phosphorescent tablet after its excitation as well as high built-tolerances the concept , however , was later built upon in 1900 by henry chapman jones ( 1855–1932 ) plate tester and modified speed system in their system , speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required for example , an emulsion rated at 250 h & d would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 h & d ) system was devised by the german astronomer julius scheiner ( 1858–1913 ) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography scheiner 's system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development speed was expressed in degrees scheiner , originally ranging from 1° sch iso 2240:1982 ( 1982-07 ) , iso 2240:1994 ( 1994-09 ) , iso 2240:2003 ( 2003–10 ) photography — colour reversal camera films — determination of iso speed general purpose photographic exposure meters ( photoelectric type ) — guide to product specification photography — colour negative films for still photography — determination of iso speed photography — digital still cameras — determination of exposure index , iso speed ratings , standard output sensitivity , and recommended exposure index american standard method for determining photographic speed and speed number american standard method for determining speed of photographic negative materials ( monochrome , continuous tone ) speed of photographic negative materials ( monochrome , continuous tone , method for determining ) photography – colour reversal camera films – determination of iso speed asa ph2.27-1965 ( 1965-07-06 ) , asa ph2.27-1971 , asa ph2.27-1976 , ansi ph2.27-1979 , ansi ph2.27-1981 , ansi ph2.27-1988 ( 1988-08-04 ) photography – colour negative films for still photography – determination of iso speed ( withdrawn ) photography color negative films for still photography – determination of iso speed superseded by bsi bs 1380-1:1973 ( 1973-12 ) , bsi bs 1380-2:1984 ( 1984-09 ) , bsi bs 1380-3:1980 ( 1980-04 ) and others speed of sensitized photographic materials : negative monochrome material for still and cine photography superseded by din 4512-1:1971-04 , din 4512-4:1977-06 , din 4512-5:1977-10 and others photography – colour reversal camera films – determination of iso speed ( iso 2240:2003 )

film speed measurement systems the speed of the emulsion was then expressed in 'degrees ' warnerke ( sometimes seen as warn each number represented an increase of 1/3 in speed , typical plate speeds were between 10° and 25° warnerke at the time the concept , however , was later built upon in 1900 by henry chapman jones ( 1855–1932 ) plate tester and modified speed system in their system , speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required for example , an emulsion rated at 250 h & d would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 h & d ) system was devised by the german astronomer julius scheiner ( 1858–1913 ) in 1894 originally as a method of comparing the speeds of plates used for astronomical photography scheiner 's system rated the speed of a plate by the least exposure to produce a visible darkening upon development speed was expressed in degrees scheiner , originally ranging from 1° sch geneva : international organization for standardization iso 2240:1982 ( 1982-07 ) , iso 2240:1994 ( 1994-09 ) , iso 2240:2003 ( 2003–10 ) photography — colour reversal camera films — determination of iso speed general purpose photographic exposure meters ( photoelectric type ) — guide to product specification photography — colour negative films for still photography — determination of iso speed photography — digital still cameras — determination of exposure index , iso speed ratings , standard output sensitivity , and recommended exposure index american standard method for determining photographic speed and speed number american standard method for determining speed of photographic negative materials ( monochrome , continuous tone ) new york : united states of america standards institute ( usasi ) photography — black-and-white pictorial still camera negative film/process systems — determination of iso speed ( same as ansi/iso 6-1993 ) photography ( sensitometry ) color reversal camera films – determination of iso speed photography – colour reversal camera films – determination of iso speed new york : american national standards institute photography color negative films for still photography – determination of iso speed bsi bs iso 2240:1994 ( 1993-03-15 ) , bsi bs iso 2240:2003 ( 2004-02-11 ) bsi bs iso 5800:1987 ( 1995-03-15 ) photography – colour negative films for still photography – determination of iso speed ( iso 5800:1987 + corr what is the meaning of iso for digital cameras ? digital photography faq signal-dependent noise modeling , estimation , and removal for digital imaging sensors

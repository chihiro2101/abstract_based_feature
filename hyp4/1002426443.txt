in the final part of the work , campanella prophesies & mdash ; in the veiled language of astrology & mdash ; that the spanish kings , in alliance with the pope , are destined to be the instruments of a divine plan : the final victory of the true faith and its diffusion in the whole world while one could argue that campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the new world , it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before the city of the sun , the monarchy in spain , in which campanella exposes his vision of a unified , peaceful world governed by a theocracy monarchy protected and defended by seven circles of walls , constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens , the city is located in a place with an ideal climate , conducive to physical health , and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer one of the most significant aspects of this community is the distribution of work once again campanella engages in an explicit polemic with aristotle , who had excluded artisans , peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue in the city of the sun no occupation is vile or base , and all are of equal dignity—in fact , those workers who are required to expend greater effort , such as artisans and builders , receive more praise the only thing that they consider to be despicable is idleness , and in this way they come to privilege the decent work and to overturn an absurd conception of nobility , linked to inactivity and vice thanks to the equal division of labour , it is sufficient for each person to spend only four working time ; but it is essential that they all work , because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others one of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of the city of the sun , which immediately struck its readers , are the painted walls of the city in addition to the common ownership and the painted walls , another characteristic feature of the city of the sun , one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that campanella himself describes as “ hard and arduous ” , is the community of wives sexual generation , on the other hand , must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception , determined by an astrologer

in the final part of the work , campanella prophesies & mdash ; in the veiled language of astrology & mdash ; that the spanish kings , in alliance with the pope , are destined to be the instruments of a divine plan : the final victory of the true faith and its diffusion in the whole world while one could argue that campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the new world , it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before the city of the sun , the monarchy in spain , in which campanella exposes his vision of a unified , peaceful world governed by a theocracy monarchy protected and defended by seven circles of walls , constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens , the city is located in a place with an ideal climate , conducive to physical health , and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer in the city of the sun no occupation is vile or base , and all are of equal dignity—in fact , those workers who are required to expend greater effort , such as artisans and builders , receive more praise everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work , and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude thanks to the equal division of labour , it is sufficient for each person to spend only four working time ; but it is essential that they all work , because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others one of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of the city of the sun , which immediately struck its readers , are the painted walls of the city apart from enclosing and protecting the city , the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge in addition to the common ownership and the painted walls , another characteristic feature of the city of the sun , one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that campanella himself describes as “ hard and arduous ” , is the community of wives in trento 's civic library , there is kept a 1602 manuscript of the city of the sun ( shelf mark bct1-1538 ) , discovered in 1943 by italian historian luigi firpo at the bottom , it is sewed to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated : it 's a copy by anonymous author of '' the city of the sun ''

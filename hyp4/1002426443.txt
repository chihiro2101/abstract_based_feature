in the final part of the work , campanella prophesies & mdash ; in the veiled language of astrology & mdash ; that the spanish kings , in alliance with the pope , are destined to be the instruments of a divine plan : the final victory of the true faith and its diffusion in the whole world while one could argue that campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the new world , it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before the city of the sun , the monarchy in spain , in which campanella exposes his vision of a unified , peaceful world governed by a theocracy monarchy protected and defended by seven circles of walls , constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens , the city is located in a place with an ideal climate , conducive to physical health , and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer once again campanella engages in an explicit polemic with aristotle , who had excluded artisans , peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue in the city of the sun no occupation is vile or base , and all are of equal dignity—in fact , those workers who are required to expend greater effort , such as artisans and builders , receive more praise one of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of the city of the sun , which immediately struck its readers , are the painted walls of the city campanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries , and in the city of the sun he provides many examples of curious inventions , such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails , and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one 's feet , leaving one 's hands free in addition to the common ownership and the painted walls , another characteristic feature of the city of the sun , one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that campanella himself describes as “ hard and arduous ” , is the community of wives sexual generation , on the other hand , must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception , determined by an astrologer the religious beliefs of the citizenry , even though they include fundamental principles of christianity ( such as the immortality of the soul and divine providence ) , form a natural religion that establishes a sort of osmosis between the city and the stars in trento 's civic library , there is kept a 1602 manuscript of the city of the sun ( shelf mark bct1-1538 ) , discovered in 1943 by italian historian luigi firpo

in the final part of the work , campanella prophesies & mdash ; in the veiled language of astrology & mdash ; that the spanish kings , in alliance with the pope , are destined to be the instruments of a divine plan : the final victory of the true faith and its diffusion in the whole world while one could argue that campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the new world , it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before the city of the sun , the monarchy in spain , in which campanella exposes his vision of a unified , peaceful world governed by a theocracy monarchy protected and defended by seven circles of walls , constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens , the city is located in a place with an ideal climate , conducive to physical health , and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer in the city of the sun no occupation is vile or base , and all are of equal dignity—in fact , those workers who are required to expend greater effort , such as artisans and builders , receive more praise thanks to the equal division of labour , it is sufficient for each person to spend only four working time ; but it is essential that they all work , because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others the citizens possess nothing ; instead , everything is held in common , from food to houses , from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities , from honors to amusements , from women to children one of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of the city of the sun , which immediately struck its readers , are the painted walls of the city apart from enclosing and protecting the city , the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge in addition to the common ownership and the painted walls , another characteristic feature of the city of the sun , one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that campanella himself describes as “ hard and arduous ” , is the community of wives in one of his poems campanella promises : “ i shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar ” in trento 's civic library , there is kept a 1602 manuscript of the city of the sun ( shelf mark bct1-1538 ) , discovered in 1943 by italian historian luigi firpo

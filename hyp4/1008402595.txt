the first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by frenchman maxime guillaume in 1928 , british raf college cranwell cadet frank whittle formally submitted his ideas for a turbojet to his superiors frank whittle , improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles , british patent no griffith in a seminal paper in 1926 ( '' an aerodynamic theory of turbine design '' ) whittle would later concentrate on the simpler centrifugal compressor only , for a variety of practical reasons whittle had the first turbojet to run , the power jets wu , on 12 april 1937 it turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools , so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off air is drawn into the rotating compressor via the intake and is compressed to a higher pressure before entering the combustion chamber the combustion products leave the combustor and expand through the turbine where power is extracted to drive the compressor by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable one of the last applications for a turbojet engine was concorde which used the olympus 593 engine during the design the turbojet was found to be the optimum for cruising at twice the speed of sound despite the advantage of turbofans for lower speeds pre-jet commercial aircraft were designed with as many as four engines in part because of concerns over in-flight failures high-temperature alloys were a reverse salient , a key technology that dragged progress on jet engines automatic temperature limiting was introduced to reduce pilot workload and reduce the likelihood of turbine damage due to over-temperature the air flowing into a turbojet engine is always subsonic , regardless of the speed of the aircraft itself the intake has to supply air to the engine with an acceptably small variation in pressure ( known as distortion ) and having lost as little energy as possible on the way ( known as pressure recovery ) the intake gains prominence at high speeds when it generates more compression than the compressor stage the compressor is driven by the turbine turbojets supply bleed air from the compressor to the aircraft for the environmental control system , anti-icing , and fuel tank pressurization , for example in a turbojet , the air and fuel mixture burn in the combustor and pass through to the turbine in a continuous flowing process with no pressure build-up after the turbine , the gases expand through the exhaust nozzle producing a high velocity jet some engines used both at the same time when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity

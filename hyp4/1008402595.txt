the first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by frenchman maxime guillaume frank whittle , improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles , british patent no whittle would later concentrate on the simpler centrifugal compressor only , for a variety of practical reasons whittle had the first turbojet to run , the power jets wu , on 12 april 1937 it turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools , so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off the gloster e.28/39 , ( also referred to as the '' gloster whittle '' , '' gloster pioneer '' , or '' gloster g.40 '' ) was the first british jet-engined aircraft to fly the first two operational turbojet aircraft , the messerschmitt me 262 and then the gloster meteor , entered service in 1944 , towards the end of world war ii air is drawn into the rotating compressor via the intake and is compressed to a higher pressure before entering the combustion chamber fuel is mixed with the compressed air and burns in the combustor the combustion products leave the combustor and expand through the turbine where power is extracted to drive the compressor the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet the first jet engines were turbojets , with either a centrifugal compressor ( as in the heinkel hes 3 ) , or axial compressors ( as in the junkers jumo 004 ) which gave a smaller diameter , although longer , engine by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable overseas flight paths were plotted to keep planes within an hour of a landing field , lengthening flights the increase in reliability that came with the turbojet enabled three- and two-engine designs , and more direct long-distance flights non-uk jet engines built in the 1930s and 1940s had to be overhauled every 10 or 20 hours due to creep failure and other types of damage to blades despite their high maintenance , some of the early jet fighters are still operational with their original engines on early engines , the turbine temperature limit had to be monitored , and avoided , by the pilot , typically during starting and at maximum thrust settings an intake , or tube , is needed in front of the compressor to help direct the incoming air smoothly into the moving compressor blades the air flowing into a turbojet engine is always subsonic , regardless of the speed of the aircraft itself the intake gains prominence at high speeds when it generates more compression than the compressor stage in a turbojet , the air and fuel mixture burn in the combustor and pass through to the turbine in a continuous flowing process with no pressure build-up less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity

the first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by frenchman maxime guillaume frank whittle , improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles , british patent no whittle had the first turbojet to run , the power jets wu , on 12 april 1937 whittle 's team experienced near-panic when the engine would not stop , accelerating even after the fuel was switched off the gloster e.28/39 , ( also referred to as the '' gloster whittle '' , '' gloster pioneer '' , or '' gloster g.40 '' ) was the first british jet-engined aircraft to fly it was designed to test the whittle jet engine in flight , leading to the development of the gloster meteor the first two operational turbojet aircraft , the messerschmitt me 262 and then the gloster meteor , entered service in 1944 , towards the end of world war ii air is drawn into the rotating compressor via the intake and is compressed to a higher pressure before entering the combustion chamber the combustion products leave the combustor and expand through the turbine where power is extracted to drive the compressor the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet the first jet engines were turbojets , with either a centrifugal compressor ( as in the heinkel hes 3 ) , or axial compressors ( as in the junkers jumo 004 ) which gave a smaller diameter , although longer , engine by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable one of the last applications for a turbojet engine was concorde which used the olympus 593 engine during the design the turbojet was found to be the optimum for cruising at twice the speed of sound despite the advantage of turbofans for lower speeds early german turbojets had severe limitations on the amount of running they could do due to the lack of suitable high temperature materials for the turbines british engines such as the rolls-royce welland used better materials giving improved durability the air flowing into a turbojet engine is always subsonic , regardless of the speed of the aircraft itself it rotates at high speed , adding energy to the airflow and at the same time squeezing ( compressing ) it into a smaller space at the large end of the range , the ge-90-115 fan rotates at about 2,500 rpm , while a small helicopter engine compressor rotates around 50,000 rpm turbojets supply bleed air from the compressor to the aircraft for the environmental control system , anti-icing , and fuel tank pressurization , for example less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits the nozzle pressure ratio on a turbojet is high enough at higher thrust settings to cause the nozzle to choke when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity '' gas turbine theory '' cohen , rogers , saravanamuttoo , , p72-73 , fig 3.11 however , for supersonic aircraft this can be beneficial , and is part of the reason why the concorde employed turbojets

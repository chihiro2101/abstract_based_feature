the first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by frenchman maxime guillaume frank whittle , improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles , british patent no whittle would later concentrate on the simpler centrifugal compressor only , for a variety of practical reasons whittle had the first turbojet to run , the power jets wu , on 12 april 1937 it turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools , so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off it was designed to test the whittle jet engine in flight , leading to the development of the gloster meteor air is drawn into the rotating compressor via the intake and is compressed to a higher pressure before entering the combustion chamber the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable one of the last applications for a turbojet engine was concorde which used the olympus 593 engine for concorde less fuel was required to produce a given thrust for a mile at mach 2.0 than a modern high-bypass turbofan such as general electric cf6 at its mach 0.86 optimum speed turbojet engines had a significant impact on commercial aviation non-uk jet engines built in the 1930s and 1940s had to be overhauled every 10 or 20 hours due to creep failure and other types of damage to blades british engines such as the rolls-royce welland used better materials giving improved durability general electric in the united states was in a good position to enter the jet engine business due to its experience with the high-temperature materials used in their turbosuperchargers during world war ii garvin , '' starting something big '' , , p.5 water injection was a common method used to increase thrust , usually during takeoff , in early turbojets that were thrust-limited by their allowable turbine entry temperature automatic temperature limiting was introduced to reduce pilot workload and reduce the likelihood of turbine damage due to over-temperature an intake , or tube , is needed in front of the compressor to help direct the incoming air smoothly into the moving compressor blades the air flowing into a turbojet engine is always subsonic , regardless of the speed of the aircraft itself the intake has to supply air to the engine with an acceptably small variation in pressure ( known as distortion ) and having lost as little energy as possible on the way ( known as pressure recovery ) turbojets supply bleed air from the compressor to the aircraft for the environmental control system , anti-icing , and fuel tank pressurization , for example in a turbojet , the air and fuel mixture burn in the combustor and pass through to the turbine in a continuous flowing process with no pressure build-up afterburners are used almost exclusively on supersonic aircraft , most being military aircraft when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity

the first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by frenchman maxime guillaume in 1928 , british raf college cranwell cadet frank whittle formally submitted his ideas for a turbojet to his superiors frank whittle , improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles , british patent no whittle 's team experienced near-panic when the engine would not stop , accelerating even after the fuel was switched off it turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools , so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off the gloster e.28/39 , ( also referred to as the '' gloster whittle '' , '' gloster pioneer '' , or '' gloster g.40 '' ) was the first british jet-engined aircraft to fly it was designed to test the whittle jet engine in flight , leading to the development of the gloster meteor the first two operational turbojet aircraft , the messerschmitt me 262 and then the gloster meteor , entered service in 1944 , towards the end of world war ii the combustion products leave the combustor and expand through the turbine where power is extracted to drive the compressor the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet the first jet engines were turbojets , with either a centrifugal compressor ( as in the heinkel hes 3 ) , or axial compressors ( as in the junkers jumo 004 ) which gave a smaller diameter , although longer , engine by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable one of the last applications for a turbojet engine was concorde which used the olympus 593 engine early german turbojets had severe limitations on the amount of running they could do due to the lack of suitable high temperature materials for the turbines british engines such as the rolls-royce welland used better materials giving improved durability despite their high maintenance , some of the early jet fighters are still operational with their original engines on early engines , the turbine temperature limit had to be monitored , and avoided , by the pilot , typically during starting and at maximum thrust settings the air flowing into a turbojet engine is always subsonic , regardless of the speed of the aircraft itself compressor types used in turbojets were typically axial or centrifugal less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits air from the compressor is passed through these to keep the metal temperature within limits after the turbine , the gases expand through the exhaust nozzle producing a high velocity jet the fuel consumption is very high , typically four times that of the main engine '' gas turbine theory '' cohen , rogers , saravanamuttoo , , p72-73 , fig 3.11 however , for supersonic aircraft this can be beneficial , and is part of the reason why the concorde employed turbojets

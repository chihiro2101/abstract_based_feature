the first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by frenchman maxime guillaume in 1928 , british raf college cranwell cadet frank whittle formally submitted his ideas for a turbojet to his superiors frank whittle , improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles , british patent no the patent showed a two-stage axial compressor feeding a single-sided centrifugal compressor whittle had the first turbojet to run , the power jets wu , on 12 april 1937 whittle 's team experienced near-panic when the engine would not stop , accelerating even after the fuel was switched off it turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools , so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off the gloster e.28/39 , ( also referred to as the '' gloster whittle '' , '' gloster pioneer '' , or '' gloster g.40 '' ) was the first british jet-engined aircraft to fly air is drawn into the rotating compressor via the intake and is compressed to a higher pressure before entering the combustion chamber fuel is mixed with the compressed air and burns in the combustor the turbine exit gases still contain considerable energy that is converted in the propelling nozzle to a high speed jet by replacing the propeller used on piston engines with a high speed jet of exhaust , higher aircraft speeds were attainable one of the last applications for a turbojet engine was concorde which used the olympus 593 engine during the design the turbojet was found to be the optimum for cruising at twice the speed of sound despite the advantage of turbofans for lower speeds despite their high maintenance , some of the early jet fighters are still operational with their original engines on early engines , the turbine temperature limit had to be monitored , and avoided , by the pilot , typically during starting and at maximum thrust settings these vanes also helped to direct the air onto the blades the compressor is driven by the turbine turbojets supply bleed air from the compressor to the aircraft for the environmental control system , anti-icing , and fuel tank pressurization , for example the engine itself needs air at various pressures and flow rates to keep it running further compressed air is introduced which completes the combustion process and reduces the temperature of the combustion products to a level which the turbine can accept less than 25 % of the air is typically used for combustion , as an overall lean mixture is required to keep within the turbine temperature limits 1960 & 124 ; flight & 124 ; archive the hottest turbine vanes and blades in an engine have internal cooling passages when used in a turbojet application , where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle , raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity

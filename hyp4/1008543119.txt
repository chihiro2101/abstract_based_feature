standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board 's length , width and thickness more recently however , the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account , meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume the surface of the board that rests on the water is usually concave but sometimes convex the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard contours such as concaves ( similar to the deck of a skateboard ) or rail channels ( to add structural rigidity ) can also be shaped into the deck wax comes in different degrees of hardness allowing its application in differing water temperatures the surfboard fin is a stabilizing rudder fixed to the rear of the surfboard to prevent it from sliding sideways the american surfer tom blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard , fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935 about one or two years later , woody brown ( surfer ) independently developed a similar design , but brown himself gave blake precedence : '' ( i made my first surfboard keel ) about '36 or '37 , somewhere in there ; about the same time the template of the modern surfboard fin was developed by george greenough in the 1960s the australian surfer 's journal volume 2 no 2 autumn 1999 pages 82-84 the single fin changed little until the late 70s , when a second was added and popularised by australian mark richards he created a prototype and 30 years later his '' thruster '' design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards this provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced , utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place this innovation opened the market to a range of fin designs , including single foiled fins , concave inside surfaces , and curved fins bullet fins were invented in the 2005 by ron pettibone to increase surfboard hull planing and rail-to-rail transition speed this new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag winged fins are another type of surfboard fin , the genesis of which was america 's cup sailboat design the starfin was designed in the 1980s by the america 's cup yacht designer , ben lexcen , who had designed the winged keel for the america 's cup boat , australia ii the purpose of winglets , as in airplane design , is to increase lift ( horizontal turning force in the case of surfboard fins ) while reducing drag , by reducing the fin-tip vortex in windsurfing camber is used to increase the lift to drag ratio of the fin and to minimise cavitation and the risk of spin-out several fin manufacturers tried making some fins at that time , after the article was discussed on swaylock 's design forum hand foiling tubercles can take up to 40 hours+ roy stuart worked on wooden prototypes for years before creating the first polycarbonate , 3d printed , whale bumped surfboard fins in 2013 the tri-fin 's design attempts to incorporate the glide of a longboard and the performance of a shortboard into a single layout a '' quad '' four fins , typically arranged as two pairs of thrusters in wing formation , which are quick down the line but tend to lose energy through turns dubbed a '' guitar pick '' the nubster was designed to be used as a fifth fin the nubster helped professional surfer kelly slater win contests in new york and portugal in 2011 a surfboard leash or leg rope is the rope that attaches a surfboard to the surfer this can be pointed or rounded and can be made with a steep incline ( '' rocker '' , see below ) or a gentle one there are several names for this piece of foam applied to the top of a surfboard to increase the grip and allow surfers to have more control and perform more high performance maneuvers traction pads are used on both shortboards and longboards , usually applied to the tail area of a surfboard there are several brands of surfboard traction pads on the market , but the most popular brands include ; dakine , pro-lite , waxmat , cush , oam and famous larger , fuller rails contain a greater volume of foam giving the board increased buoyancy along the edge , while sharper , narrower rails have less volume , making the board easier to '' sink '' and '' lean on edge '' while riding down the line , one rail is always in the water while the other is suspended freely in the air this refers to the vertical curve of the board between nose and tail in board design , the '' stringer '' is a board 's central plane of reflection , down the middle of its deck and its keel the stringer serves to increase the board 's overall strength and reduce its flexibility all surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination a surfboard 's big summertime enemy - surfboard delamination ! delamination often first appear around dents modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials : polyurethane ( pu foam ) with polyester resin have been used in surfboards since the 1950s , and is , therefore , the oldest of the modern construction methods surfboard foam : polyurethane or polystyrene core ? note that it is also possible to build pu boards using epoxy this will give you the trusty feel and performance of your standard board , but with the added strength of epoxy resin instead of polyester '' pu is still the most used material in surf board construction today the ps foam core is therefore enclosed with a layer of epoxy to increase strength surf science know your foam often ps boards are not as stiff as pu boards , which may be the reason most professional surfers still prefer pu another drawback with eps foam is that it absorbs water more easily eps boards typically do n't delaminate easily , but should be constructed using a vent to prevent delamination due to outgassing xps therefore resists water absorption very well , since there are no air gaps between the beads depending on construction , xps boards may however be more prone delamination due to the closed structure preventing the epoxy resin getting a good grip on the foam the '' skin '' , made of a gloss coated foam , is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the surface of the entire epoxy surfboard compared to the shortboards , longboards are considerably easier to learn on as they are capable of achieving stability , thus making the transition quite difficult in malibu ( in los angeles county ) , the beach was so popular amongst the early surfers that it lent its name to the type of longboard , the malibu surfboard a longboard with a single fin allows the board to pivot turn in order to remain in the curl of the wave these boards are normally ridden by those wanting the feel of a longboard with the increased agility of a short board

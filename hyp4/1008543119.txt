choice of surf board type and size can be complex standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board 's length , width and thickness more recently however , the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account , meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume the surface of the board that rests on the water is usually concave but sometimes convex the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface modern surfboards often contain multiple contours on the bottom of the board , termed concaves these concaves have different uses and vary among different types of surfboards most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard these boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom contours such as concaves ( similar to the deck of a skateboard ) or rail channels ( to add structural rigidity ) can also be shaped into the deck in the early days , surfers would stabilize the board by hanging the toes of their back foot over the edge of the board and would steer by putting their foot in the water but , i did n't know anything about ( blake ) and his experiments with adding fins to surfboards ) this innovation revolutionized surfing , allowing surfers to direct the board 's momentum and providing more balance when turning the template of the modern surfboard fin was developed by george greenough in the 1960s this provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced , utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place these systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard , by changing the size and shape of fins used since the mid 1990s , half tunnel fins have mainly been used on very long hollow wooden surfboards mainly surfed by roy stuart bullet fins were invented in the 2005 by ron pettibone to increase surfboard hull planing and rail-to-rail transition speed just as with the bow of a ship , the traditional surfboard fin creates a wave as it displaces the water in its path the bulb of the bullet fin reduces this drag by creating a new ( primary ) fin wave in front of the original ( secondary ) wave this new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag winged fins are another type of surfboard fin , the genesis of which was america 's cup sailboat design fins with self-adjusting camber offer the improved qualities in both port side and starboard side sailing directions spitfire fins are based on the wing configuration used by spitfire aeroplanes the process of grinding bumps , which are properly foiled , into an existing fin is an arduous , time consuming task roy stuart worked on wooden prototypes for years before creating the first polycarbonate , 3d printed , whale bumped surfboard fins in 2013 the tri-fin 's design attempts to incorporate the glide of a longboard and the performance of a shortboard into a single layout the additional fins ensure that even what riding down the line , two , or at least one , vertical control surface is in black water ( not unstable foam ) allows riders better turning capabilities a '' quad '' four fins , typically arranged as two pairs of thrusters in wing formation , which are quick down the line but tend to lose energy through turns it prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers there are several names for this piece of foam applied to the top of a surfboard to increase the grip and allow surfers to have more control and perform more high performance maneuvers traction pads are used on both shortboards and longboards , usually applied to the tail area of a surfboard there are several brands of surfboard traction pads on the market , but the most popular brands include ; dakine , pro-lite , waxmat , cush , oam and famous in board design , the '' stringer '' is a board 's central plane of reflection , down the middle of its deck and its keel engineers discover why toucan beaks are models of lightweight strength delamination is a problem where the skin of the board ( i.e a surfboard 's big summertime enemy - surfboard delamination ! delamination often first appear around dents many hand-shaped boards are made of pu since it is a brittle material , making it easy to form by hand using sandpaper , shortening the build time surfboard foam : polyurethane or polystyrene core ? note that it is also possible to build pu boards using epoxy this will give you the trusty feel and performance of your standard board , but with the added strength of epoxy resin instead of polyester '' pu is still the most used material in surf board construction today the reason epoxy resin is used exclusively instead of polyester resin on these boards , is that the polystyrene foam reacts chemically upon contact with polyester resin , causing the ps foam to melt surf science know your foam often ps boards are not as stiff as pu boards , which may be the reason most professional surfers still prefer pu expanded polystyrene is the lightest foam material commonly used to produce surfboards today , being lighter than both pu and xps a drawback to eps is that it is difficult to shape by hand , and eps boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself it is possible to buy such semi-finished eps boards ( known as '' pop out boards '' ) to which the buyer can add glassfiber and resin themselves surfboard blanks types of eps pu and xps cores and blank – sanded australia xps has a homogenous structure consisting of several layers of continuously extruded closed cells xps boards typically do n't have a vent fiberglass is the most common skin regardless of foam type other skin materials used are bamboo , carbon fiber , hemp kevlar and innegra resin basics – sanded australia '' cores : epoxy can be used on pu , eps and xps cores '' the '' skin '' , made of a gloss coated foam , is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the surface of the entire epoxy surfboard thumb right the longboard is primarily a single-finned surfboard with large rounded nose and length of in malibu ( in los angeles county ) , the beach was so popular amongst the early surfers that it lent its name to the type of longboard , the malibu surfboard the classic single-fin longboard retains much of its classic design including a single fin , weight , and considerable buoyancy sometimes referred as a '' single-fin with training wheels '' , the 2+1 's fins actually takes the features of the classic longboard and the tri-fin

choice of surf board type and size can be complex standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board 's length , width and thickness more recently however , the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account , meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume the surface of the board that rests on the water is usually concave but sometimes convex the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface modern surfboards often contain multiple contours on the bottom of the board , termed concaves these concaves have different uses and vary among different types of surfboards most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard the purpose of concave is to direct water through the fins of the surfboard surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard these boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom contours such as concaves ( similar to the deck of a skateboard ) or rail channels ( to add structural rigidity ) can also be shaped into the deck the surfboard fin is a stabilizing rudder fixed to the rear of the surfboard to prevent it from sliding sideways in the early days , surfers would stabilize the board by hanging the toes of their back foot over the edge of the board and would steer by putting their foot in the water the american surfer tom blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard , fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935 he created a prototype and 30 years later his '' thruster '' design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards this provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced , utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place these systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard , by changing the size and shape of fins used bullet fins were invented in the 2005 by ron pettibone to increase surfboard hull planing and rail-to-rail transition speed the patent-pending fins are based on 50 years of hydrodynamic research on the bulbous bow hull design just as with the bow of a ship , the traditional surfboard fin creates a wave as it displaces the water in its path the resulting turbulence places drag on the surfboard this new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag in windsurfing camber is used to increase the lift to drag ratio of the fin and to minimise cavitation and the risk of spin-out in particular windsurfers trying to improve speed records use camber fins , as the maximum performance is required on one down-wind course direction several fin manufacturers tried making some fins at that time , after the article was discussed on swaylock 's design forum the process of grinding bumps , which are properly foiled , into an existing fin is an arduous , time consuming task roy stuart worked on wooden prototypes for years before creating the first polycarbonate , 3d printed , whale bumped surfboard fins in 2013 the additional fins ensure that even what riding down the line , two , or at least one , vertical control surface is in black water ( not unstable foam ) allows riders better turning capabilities in a thruster , the symmetric , usually larger , single center fin is flanked by twin asymmetric , cambered fins a '' quad '' four fins , typically arranged as two pairs of thrusters in wing formation , which are quick down the line but tend to lose energy through turns it prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers tail shapes vary from square , pin , squash , swallow , diamond , and so onâ€”each one in turn having its own family of smaller variants there are several brands of surfboard traction pads on the market , but the most popular brands include ; dakine , pro-lite , waxmat , cush , oam and famous while riding down the line , one rail is always in the water while the other is suspended freely in the air a larger kick adds maneuverability and lift to the tail at speed and provides tail sensitivity in critical turns a board with a v-shaped tail , for example , has had the lower/ outer portion of its rear rails reduced , increasing its tail rail rocker having a flat , even deck rocker will increase a board 's flexibility , while a convex deck rocker creates a board that is thicker along the board 's stringer and stiffer in the water engineers discover why toucan beaks are models of lightweight strength delamination is a problem where the skin of the board ( i.e all surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination a surfboard 's big summertime enemy - surfboard delamination ! delamination often first appear around dents modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials : polyurethane ( pu foam ) with polyester resin have been used in surfboards since the 1950s , and is , therefore , the oldest of the modern construction methods some drawbacks are the toxicity of the material , that it is non-recyclable and that the pu foam is more flexible than some alternatives , making the board less stiff so that it can bend and twist more during use pu foam can also absorb water and yellow over time surfboard foam : polyurethane or polystyrene core ? note that it is also possible to build pu boards using epoxy within polystyrene , mainly two types are used in surfboard construction ; eps and xps however , they are more time consuming to shape by hand , taking for example 2 to 4 times as long to build expanded polystyrene is the lightest foam material commonly used to produce surfboards today , being lighter than both pu and xps it is possible to buy such semi-finished eps boards ( known as '' pop out boards '' ) to which the buyer can add glassfiber and resin themselves another drawback with eps foam is that it absorbs water more easily depending on construction , xps boards may however be more prone delamination due to the closed structure preventing the epoxy resin getting a good grip on the foam the internal structure of cush ( cushion ) boards is an epoxy surfboard with an eps ( extruded polystyrene ) shaped foam core this blank construction is then laminated with epoxy resin and fiberglass or other composite cloth as any other surfboard would be , by hand or via vacuum bag its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves the fins of the 2+1 take the rigid stability of a classic longboard , and fuses with the strength and drive of a tri-fin

standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board 's length , width and thickness the surface of the board that rests on the water is usually concave but sometimes convex the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface modern surfboards often contain multiple contours on the bottom of the board , termed concaves these concaves have different uses and vary among different types of surfboards most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard the purpose of concave is to direct water through the fins of the surfboard surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard these boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom contours such as concaves ( similar to the deck of a skateboard ) or rail channels ( to add structural rigidity ) can also be shaped into the deck wax comes in different degrees of hardness allowing its application in differing water temperatures the surfboard fin is a stabilizing rudder fixed to the rear of the surfboard to prevent it from sliding sideways the american surfer tom blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard , fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935 but , i did n't know anything about ( blake ) and his experiments with adding fins to surfboards he created a prototype and 30 years later his '' thruster '' design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards this provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced , utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place tunnel fins were invented in the 1960s by richard deese , longboard magazine vol 4 no 5 since the mid 1990s , half tunnel fins have mainly been used on very long hollow wooden surfboards mainly surfed by roy stuart just as with the bow of a ship , the traditional surfboard fin creates a wave as it displaces the water in its path the purpose of winglets , as in airplane design , is to increase lift ( horizontal turning force in the case of surfboard fins ) while reducing drag , by reducing the fin-tip vortex fins with self-adjusting camber offer the improved qualities in both port side and starboard side sailing directions in 2004 frank fish introduced the world to whale bumps with their tubercle effect several fin manufacturers tried making some fins at that time , after the article was discussed on swaylock 's design forum roy stuart worked on wooden prototypes for years before creating the first polycarbonate , 3d printed , whale bumped surfboard fins in 2013 in a thruster , the symmetric , usually larger , single center fin is flanked by twin asymmetric , cambered fins the camber is angled front in and top in , directing energy from the incoming wave to lift the board and straighten it , not dissimilar from the force vectoring provided by the geometry of a rocket 's nozzle the energy is lost as the board goes up the wave because the fins are now vectoring energy from the oncoming water toward the back of the board , bleeding speed created by professional surfer sean mattison as a rear stabilization fin the nubster helped professional surfer kelly slater win contests in new york and portugal in 2011 a surfboard leash or leg rope is the rope that attaches a surfboard to the surfer it prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers jack o'neill lost his left eye in a surf leash accident as the surgical tubing used in the early designs allowed the leash to overstretch , causing the surfboard to fly back towards the surfer this can be pointed or rounded and can be made with a steep incline ( '' rocker '' , see below ) or a gentle one tail shapes vary from square , pin , squash , swallow , diamond , and so on—each one in turn having its own family of smaller variants there are several brands of surfboard traction pads on the market , but the most popular brands include ; dakine , pro-lite , waxmat , cush , oam and famous in board design , the '' stringer '' is a board 's central plane of reflection , down the middle of its deck and its keel all surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination many hand-shaped boards are made of pu since it is a brittle material , making it easy to form by hand using sandpaper , shortening the build time some drawbacks are the toxicity of the material , that it is non-recyclable and that the pu foam is more flexible than some alternatives , making the board less stiff so that it can bend and twist more during use polystyrene ( ps foam ) with epoxy has a lower weight , but is not as strong as the more traditional pu foam within polystyrene , mainly two types are used in surfboard construction ; eps and xps however , they are more time consuming to shape by hand , taking for example 2 to 4 times as long to build surf science know your foam often ps boards are not as stiff as pu boards , which may be the reason most professional surfers still prefer pu a drawback to eps is that it is difficult to shape by hand , and eps boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself it is possible to buy such semi-finished eps boards ( known as '' pop out boards '' ) to which the buyer can add glassfiber and resin themselves epoxy 101 - epoxy surfboards improvements in manufacturing has alleviated some of these problems resin basics – sanded australia '' cores : epoxy can be used on pu , eps and xps cores '' surfboards have traditionally been constructed using polyurethane foam and it remains a popular choice shapers then cut , plane , and sand the board to its specifications another method of making boards is using epoxy resin and prolapse polystyrene foam , instead of polyester resin and polyurethane foam right the ochroma pyramidale wood 's surfboard history originates in the hawaiians , and the wood lead surfing 's landfall on the us west coast in the 1940s the internal structure of cush ( cushion ) boards is an epoxy surfboard with an eps ( extruded polystyrene ) shaped foam core it was not until the late 1950s and early 1960s when the surfboard design had closely evolved into today 's modern longboard the fins of the 2+1 take the rigid stability of a classic longboard , and fuses with the strength and drive of a tri-fin longboarding surf culture surfboard lock wind surfing

standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board 's length , width and thickness more recently however , the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account , meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume the surface of the board that rests on the water is usually concave but sometimes convex the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface modern surfboards often contain multiple contours on the bottom of the board , termed concaves most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard these boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom contours such as concaves ( similar to the deck of a skateboard ) or rail channels ( to add structural rigidity ) can also be shaped into the deck the template of the modern surfboard fin was developed by george greenough in the 1960s he created a prototype and 30 years later his '' thruster '' design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards this provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced , utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place these systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard , by changing the size and shape of fins used another variation of fin was later designed in the time frame known as the soul fin , a sleek bendable attachment this new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag winged fins are another type of surfboard fin , the genesis of which was america 's cup sailboat design in windsurfing camber is used to increase the lift to drag ratio of the fin and to minimise cavitation and the risk of spin-out as the camber is fixed to one side , performance when sailing in one direction is improved but performance in the other way is deteriorated spitfire fins are based on the wing configuration used by spitfire aeroplanes the tri-fin 's design attempts to incorporate the glide of a longboard and the performance of a shortboard into a single layout the additional fins ensure that even what riding down the line , two , or at least one , vertical control surface is in black water ( not unstable foam ) allows riders better turning capabilities in a thruster , the symmetric , usually larger , single center fin is flanked by twin asymmetric , cambered fins created by professional surfer sean mattison as a rear stabilization fin it prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers subsequent cords were made with less elastic materials traction pads are used on both shortboards and longboards , usually applied to the tail area of a surfboard turns are largely a matter of transitioning from rail to tail and over to the contralateral ( opposing ) rail the nose rocker or flip is the curve between the front tip and the middle or flattest portion of the board , and the tail rocker or kick is that between the tail and the middle/ flattest portion an increase in flip helps keep the board from '' pearling '' ; larger boards often require a greater flip the board 's rails and deck may also be referred to as having rocker a board with a v-shaped tail , for example , has had the lower/ outer portion of its rear rails reduced , increasing its tail rail rocker all surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination both pu boards made by hand or by machines are usually more affordable compared to other foam materials pu foam can also absorb water and yellow over time surfboard foam : polyurethane or polystyrene core ? note that it is also possible to build pu boards using epoxy polystyrene ( ps foam ) with epoxy has a lower weight , but is not as strong as the more traditional pu foam within polystyrene , mainly two types are used in surfboard construction ; eps and xps the reason epoxy resin is used exclusively instead of polyester resin on these boards , is that the polystyrene foam reacts chemically upon contact with polyester resin , causing the ps foam to melt expanded polystyrene is the lightest foam material commonly used to produce surfboards today , being lighter than both pu and xps a drawback to eps is that it is difficult to shape by hand , and eps boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself eps boards typically do n't delaminate easily , but should be constructed using a vent to prevent delamination due to outgassing surfboard blanks types of eps pu and xps cores and blank – sanded australia xps has a homogenous structure consisting of several layers of continuously extruded closed cells skin basics – sanded australia eps and xps boards are sometimes erroneously referred to as '' epoxy boards '' , while pu boards sometimes are erroneously referred to as '' fiberglass boards '' secondly , pu foam boards can also be constructed using epoxy resin once the blanks have been made they are given to shapers it is during this stage that the fins or boxes for removable fins are attached and the leash plug installed another method of making boards is using epoxy resin and prolapse polystyrene foam , instead of polyester resin and polyurethane foam in recent years , surfboards made out of balsa and a polystyrene core are becoming more popular even solid balsa surfboards are available although foam boards are usually shaped by hand , the use of machines to shape them has become increasingly popular vacuum forming and modern sandwich construction techniques borrowed from other industries have also become common balsa wood boards are lighter , more buoyant and easier to handle than other boards soft skin construction , such as cush or spacestick boards , adds an additional soft shell skin to the outside of a sandwich construction board ever since the sixth-century ce the ancient hawaiians have used solid wooden boards when practicing their ancient art of hoe he ' e nalu but in the early 1990s , the longboard returned , integrating a number of the design features invented during the shortboard revolution

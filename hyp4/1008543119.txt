choice of surf board type and size can be complex standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board 's length , width and thickness more recently however , the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account , meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume the surface of the board that rests on the water is usually concave but sometimes convex the bottom can also feature channels and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize or direct water flow across the board 's bottom surface these concaves have different uses and vary among different types of surfboards most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard the purpose of concave is to direct water through the fins of the surfboard surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard these boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom wax comes in different degrees of hardness allowing its application in differing water temperatures the american surfer tom blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard , fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935 about one or two years later , woody brown ( surfer ) independently developed a similar design , but brown himself gave blake precedence : '' ( i made my first surfboard keel ) about '36 or '37 , somewhere in there ; about the same time ) this innovation revolutionized surfing , allowing surfers to direct the board 's momentum and providing more balance when turning the australian surfer 's journal volume 2 no 2 autumn 1999 pages 82-84 the single fin changed little until the late 70s , when a second was added and popularised by australian mark richards he created a prototype and 30 years later his '' thruster '' design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards in the early 90s removable fin systems were developed and embraced these systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard , by changing the size and shape of fins used another variation of fin was later designed in the time frame known as the soul fin , a sleek bendable attachment since the mid 1990s , half tunnel fins have mainly been used on very long hollow wooden surfboards mainly surfed by roy stuart bullet fins were invented in the 2005 by ron pettibone to increase surfboard hull planing and rail-to-rail transition speed this new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag fins with winglets—tiny wings—were invented in 2005 as the camber is fixed to one side , performance when sailing in one direction is improved but performance in the other way is deteriorated the elliptical wing shapes work very well as surfboard fins and several manufacturers make fins with this more upright stance , as it increases drive and maneuverability in a thruster , the symmetric , usually larger , single center fin is flanked by twin asymmetric , cambered fins a '' quad '' four fins , typically arranged as two pairs of thrusters in wing formation , which are quick down the line but tend to lose energy through turns dubbed a '' guitar pick '' the nubster was designed to be used as a fifth fin the nubster helped professional surfer kelly slater win contests in new york and portugal in 2011 it prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers a pin tail causes the board to move faster in the water , whereas the hip tail is created to help balance more than speed there are several names for this piece of foam applied to the top of a surfboard to increase the grip and allow surfers to have more control and perform more high performance maneuvers an increase in flip helps keep the board from '' pearling '' ; larger boards often require a greater flip a larger kick adds maneuverability and lift to the tail at speed and provides tail sensitivity in critical turns having a flat , even deck rocker will increase a board 's flexibility , while a convex deck rocker creates a board that is thicker along the board 's stringer and stiffer in the water in board design , the '' stringer '' is a board 's central plane of reflection , down the middle of its deck and its keel the stringer serves to increase the board 's overall strength and reduce its flexibility to achieve positive buoyancy and a stiff deck , shapers have always reached for a foam , often hardened with a tensile skin , using toucan beak engineering concepts all surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials : polyurethane ( pu foam ) with polyester resin have been used in surfboards since the 1950s , and is , therefore , the oldest of the modern construction methods both pu boards made by hand or by machines are usually more affordable compared to other foam materials some drawbacks are the toxicity of the material , that it is non-recyclable and that the pu foam is more flexible than some alternatives , making the board less stiff so that it can bend and twist more during use pu foam can also absorb water and yellow over time this will give you the trusty feel and performance of your standard board , but with the added strength of epoxy resin instead of polyester '' pu is still the most used material in surf board construction today within polystyrene , mainly two types are used in surfboard construction ; eps and xps the reason epoxy resin is used exclusively instead of polyester resin on these boards , is that the polystyrene foam reacts chemically upon contact with polyester resin , causing the ps foam to melt a drawback to eps is that it is difficult to shape by hand , and eps boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself eps has a structure consisting of individually closed cells , but there are air gaps between the cells themselves where water can enter hollow wooden surfboards are made of wood and epoxy or oil ( as a sustainable alternative to epoxy ) , and are a reversion to using wood after the foam became dominant in the 1950s the '' skin '' , made of a gloss coated foam , is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the surface of the entire epoxy surfboard modern hybrid boards are usually in length with a more rounded profile and tail shape in the 1920s boards made of plywood or planking called hollowboards came into use it was not until the late 1950s and early 1960s when the surfboard design had closely evolved into today 's modern longboard its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves a longboard with a single fin allows the board to pivot turn in order to remain in the curl of the wave

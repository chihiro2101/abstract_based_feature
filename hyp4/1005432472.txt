'' ferguson walked east ( forward ) on the train , pulling the trigger steadily about every half second several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats , while others fled to the eastern end of the train and tried to enter the next car ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat , briefly facing each victim before firing an article in the new york times called ferguson 's actions '' as methodical as if he were taking tickets '' ferguson said , '' i 'm going to get you , '' over and over as he walked down the aisle other passengers farther away in the train did not realize that a shooting had occurred until after the train stopped , as a crowd of panicked passengers fled from the third car into neighboring cars one man appeared annoyed by their unruliness and said , '' be calm , '' before they forced a train door open and fled into the station the train 's conductor was informed of the shooting , but he decided against opening the train doors right away because two of the cars were not yet at the platform while he was reloading his third magazine , somebody yelled , '' grab him !

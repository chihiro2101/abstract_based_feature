the foss dyke joins the river trent at torksey a branch leaves the main channel , passes under the a156 bridge , and immediately enters torksey lock , which is the only lock on the canal it has six sets of gates , three sets facing lincoln , and three facing the river , which is tidal at this point , and so its level can be higher than the level of the canal ordnance survey , 1:50,000 map at saxilby , the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway crosses the waterway , to run along the south bank all the way to lincoln the original bridge was manufactured in 1884 , and crossed the great northern railway at newark-on-trent for 103 years before it was put to a new use the river till flows south and under the road to join the foss dyke , after which a new marina has been built at burton meadows the canal crosses under the a46 on the outskirts of lincoln , and then over a drainage ditch , to run alongside the carholme golf club the final bridge carries the b1273 brayford way over the canal as it enters brayford pool , once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of lincoln , but now a marina with the university of lincoln on the southern bank together with the car dyke it formed part an important transport route from peterborough to york it was reputedly used by the danes when they invaded england and by the normans to carry stone to build lincoln cathedral in the 11th century work was carried out on the foss dyke , but only the first of the witham , from brayford pool to high bridge , received attention coal traffic averaged per year , bound for lincoln , but tolls were insufficient to finance repairs the city of lincoln did not have the expertise to manage the waterway , and so leased it to richard ellison in 1741 , who had experience with the river don navigation the witham was affected more than the foss dyke , as the line followed its bank from lincoln to boston when there is insufficient water in barlings eau and the witham , torksey pumping station transfers water from the trent through a short pipeline into foss dyke a former lift bridge , which crossed the western entrance to the pool , was replaced in august 1996 by a new concrete flyover , as part of the redevelopment of the south bank , which included the opening of the university in the same year for much of its route it runs along the top of the northern floodbank , but drops down to a new crossing of the a57 road and a new bridge across the river till near saxilby

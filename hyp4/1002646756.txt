the foss dyke joins the river trent at torksey a branch leaves the main channel , passes under the a156 bridge , and immediately enters torksey lock , which is the only lock on the canal it has six sets of gates , three sets facing lincoln , and three facing the river , which is tidal at this point , and so its level can be higher than the level of the canal ordnance survey , 1:50,000 map at saxilby , the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway crosses the waterway , to run along the south bank all the way to lincoln there was once a swing bridge beyond the railway bridge , which was removed in 1937 , although the foundations are still obvious the original bridge was manufactured in 1884 , and crossed the great northern railway at newark-on-trent for 103 years before it was put to a new use the river till flows south and under the road to join the foss dyke , after which a new marina has been built at burton meadows the final bridge carries the b1273 brayford way over the canal as it enters brayford pool , once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of lincoln , but now a marina with the university of lincoln on the southern bank the unnavigable river witham flows into the bottom end of the pool , and becomes the witham navigation when it flows out on its way to boston in 1671 , during the reign of charles ii , lincoln obtained an act which authorised improvements from boston to the trent work was carried out on the foss dyke , but only the first of the witham , from brayford pool to high bridge , received attention coal traffic averaged per year , bound for lincoln , but tolls were insufficient to finance repairs the city of lincoln did not have the expertise to manage the waterway , and so leased it to richard ellison in 1741 , who had experience with the river don navigation the wakefield , lincoln and boston railway had negotiated with the proprietors of the witham and foss dyke in 1846 , to guarantee them an income by leasing the waterways however , the mslr , by then renamed the great central railway ( gcr ) , built a dock and transshipment warehouse at brayford in 1897 when there is insufficient water in barlings eau and the witham , torksey pumping station transfers water from the trent through a short pipeline into foss dyke construction of a footpath and cycleway beside the canal from lincoln to saxilby has been carried out by the lincolnshire waterways partnership , a joint initiative by lincolnshire , the environment agency and british waterways

the foss dyke joins the river trent at torksey a branch leaves the main channel , passes under the a156 bridge , and immediately enters torksey lock , which is the only lock on the canal it has six sets of gates , three sets facing lincoln , and three facing the river , which is tidal at this point , and so its level can be higher than the level of the canal a steel footbridge crosses the lock near the road , and both the footbridge and the lock are grade ii listed structures ordnance survey , 1:50,000 map at saxilby , the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway crosses the waterway , to run along the south bank all the way to lincoln the river till flows south and under the road to join the foss dyke , after which a new marina has been built at burton meadows the final bridge carries the b1273 brayford way over the canal as it enters brayford pool , once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of lincoln , but now a marina with the university of lincoln on the southern bank the unnavigable river witham flows into the bottom end of the pool , and becomes the witham navigation when it flows out on its way to boston the foss dyke was long thought to have been constructed by the romans around 120 pointers include an inscribed statuette of the god mars found in it at torksey , which is now in the british museum , but there is a lack of consensus among authors writing on the subject following king henry i 's work discussed above , the canal deteriorated , until by the 17th century it was virtually impassable the work was completed in 1672 , and included a navigable sluice or lock at torksey , which had first been proposed by simon hill in 1632 warehouses and wharves were built at brayford pool , but by 1717 , passage from torksey was again difficult navigation through lincoln and on to boston was hampered by the shallow draught available under the medieval high bridge , just below brayford pool when there is insufficient water in barlings eau and the witham , torksey pumping station transfers water from the trent through a short pipeline into foss dyke however , the demise of general commercial traffic had left brayford pool in the centre of lincoln as a derelict body of water , full of debris such as rubbish and sunken boats construction of a footpath and cycleway beside the canal from lincoln to saxilby has been carried out by the lincolnshire waterways partnership , a joint initiative by lincolnshire , the environment agency and british waterways

this prescience-enhancing property makes safe and accurate interstellar travel possible , as it enables spacing guild navigators to see safe paths through space-time and navigate the gigantic guild heighliners safely between planets the massive amount of melange needed to achieve this requires that navigators be contained in a large tank within a cloud of spice gas the fremen also use the spice to make , among other things , paper , plastics , and chemical explosives , and the existence of '' spice-cloth '' and '' spice-fiber '' rugs are noted in dune messiah ( 1969 ) and children of dune ( 1976 ) melange can be mixed with food , and it is used to make beverages such as spice coffee , spice beer , and spice liquor duke leto atreides notes that of every valuable commodity known to mankind , '' all fades before melange '' due to the rarity and value of melange and its necessity as a catalyst for interstellar travel , the padishah emperor 's power at the outset of dune is secured by his control of arrakis , which puts him on equal footing with both the assembly of noble families called the landsraad and the spacing guild , which monopoly interstellar travel '' later in heretics of dune ( 1984 ) , a discovered hoard of melange appears as '' mounds of dark reddish brown '' '' herbert writes repeatedly , starting in dune ( 1965 ) , that melange smells like cinnamon in dune , paul initially has green eyes , but after several years on arrakis they begin to take on the deep , uniform blue of the fremen '' in children of dune , the term '' spice trance '' is used to describe the effects of an overdose of spice in dune , there is only one source of melange : the sands of the planet arrakis , colloquially known as dune , and millennia later called simply '' rakis '' frank herbert describes such a spice blow in the following passage from dune : herbert writes that the pre-spice mass , '' after exposure to sun and air , becomes melange '' collecting the melange is hazardous in the extreme , since rhythmic activity on the desert surface of arrakis attracts the worms , which can be up to 400 meters ( 1,300 feet ) in length and are capable of swallowing a mining crawler whole within the 1500 years between the events of god emperor of dune ( 1981 ) and heretics of dune ( 1984 ) , the tleilaxu discover an artificial method of producing the spice in their axlotl tanks , previously only used to create gholas in sandworms of dune , brian herbert and anderson 's 2007 conclusion to the original series , the spacing guild is manipulated into replacing its navigators with ixian navigation devices and cutting off the navigators ' supply of melange carol hart analyzes the concept of the drug in the essay '' melange '' in the science of dune ( 2008 )

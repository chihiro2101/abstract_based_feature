edgar cayce was born on march 18 , 1877 , near beverly , south of hopkinsville , kentucky he was one of six children of farmers carrie elizabeth ( née major ) and leslie burr cayce as a child , he played with the 'little folk ' and was alleged to have seen his deceased grandfather he was taken to church when he was 10 , and from then he read the bible , becoming engrossed , and completing a dozen readings by the time he was 12 he was frightened , but he said that most of all he wanted to help others , especially sick children the next night , after a complaint from the school teacher , his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling , eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation when his father came back into the room and woke him up , he knew all the answers on being questioned , cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books his father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around , resulting in cayce becoming '' different '' from his peers shortly after this , cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep his father boasted that his son was , '' the greatest fellow in the world when he 's asleep '' sugrue 2003 , pp this stunned everyone there , as the mule could not be ridden the owner , thinking it may be time to break the animal in again , attempted to mount it but was immediately thrown off in december 1893 , the cayce family moved to hopkinsville , kentucky , and occupied 705 west seventh on the southeast corner of seventh and young streets cayce 's education stopped in the ninth grade because his family could not afford the costs involved much of the remainder of cayce 's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money throughout his life , cayce was drawn to church as a member of the disciples of christ he said he could see auras around people , spoke to angels , and heard voices of departed relatives he then decided to take up the trade of photography , an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice in 1901 , a traveling stage hypnotist and entertainer named hart , who referred to himself as '' the laugh man '' , was performing at the hopkinsville opera house cayce accepted his offer , and the experiment was conducted in the office of manning brown , the local throat specialist cayce 's voice allegedly returned while in a hypnotic trance but disappeared on awakening hart tried a posthypnotic suggestion that the voice would continue to function after the trance , but this proved unsuccessful since hart had appointments at other cities , he could not continue his hypnotic treatments of cayce , but admitted he had failed because cayce would not go into the third stage of hypnosis to take a suggestion on awakening , his voice was alleged to have remained normal layne asked cayce to describe layne 's own ailments and suggest cures , and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective layne suggested that cayce offer his trance healing to the public cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep , and whether the remedies were safe he began , with layne 's help , to offer free treatments to the townspeople layne described cayce 's method as , '' a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance '' reports of cayce 's work appeared in the newspapers , which inspired many postal inquiries cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room given only the person 's name and location , cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed '' the entity '' , and then provide a remedy cayce was still reticent and worried , as '' one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer '' there was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane , or at least that their health suffered cayce soon became famous , and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence in may 1902 he got a bookshop job in the town of bowling green where he boarded with some young professionals , two of whom were doctors he lost his voice while there and layne came to help effect the normal cure , finally visiting every week cayce , still worried , kept the meetings secret , and continued to refuse money for his readings they had three children : hugh lynn cayce ( march 16 , 1907 – july 4 , 1982 ) , milton porter cayce ( march 28 , 1911 – may 17 , 1911 ) , and edgar evans cayce ( february 9 , 1918 – february 15 , 2013 ) the virginian pilot ( obituaries ) feb 19 , 2013 she still disapproved of the readings , and cayce still agonized over the morality of them he left to acquire osteopathic qualifications in franklin all the experiments confirmed the accuracy of the readings after a violent examination by doctors while in a trance , cayce refused any more investigations , declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings sugrue 2003 , pp in 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios , leading to bankruptcy when asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method , they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind after soul searching the whole night , cayce finally accepted the offer under certain conditions , including that he did not take money for the readings cayce read the back readings , but they contained so many technical terms that he gained no more understanding of what he was doing he preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis , but only the doctors in hopkinsville would cooperate , whereas most of the patients were not in that locality also , doctors from all specialties were needed as the treatments prescribed varied widely shortly after this , in 1912 , cayce , whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings , discovered that ketchum had not been honest about them , and had also used them to gamble for finance he argued in defense that the medical profession were not backing them he continued to work in an apparent trance state with a hypnotist all his life his wife and eldest son later replaced layne in this role even though cayce was reluctant to help them , he was persuaded to give his readings , which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful in 1923 , arthur lammers , a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics , persuaded cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects sugrue 2003 , p cayce was told by lammers that , while in his trance state , he spoke of lammers ' past lives and of reincarnation , something lammers believed in twelve years earlier cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation in reading 4841–1 , given april 22 , 1911 , cayce referred to the soul being '' transmigrated '' lammers asked cayce to come to dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings it appeared that cayce 's subconscious mind was as much at home with the language of metaphysics as it was with the language of anatomy and medicine cayce used his knowledge of the bible to convince his family that the word of the bible agreed with reincarnation and other metaphysical teachings sugrue 2003 , pp it was at this time cayce directed his activities to provide readings centred around health cayce 's mature period , in which he created the several institutions that survived him , can be considered to have started in 1925 the readings increasingly came to involve occult or esoteric themes the idea of an association and a hospital was mooted again , but the readings insisted on virginia beach , not suiting most of the people cayce removed the files of the readings from the hospital and took them home many mansions elaborates on cayce 's work and supports his stated abilities with real life examples in many trance sessions , he interpreted the history of life on earth edgar cayce on atlantis , new york :

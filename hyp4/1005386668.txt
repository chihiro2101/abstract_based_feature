studio in bowling green , while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon , with cayce ’ s co-operation all the experiments confirmed the accuracy of the readings after a violent examination by doctors while in a trance , cayce refused any more investigations , declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings in 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios , leading to bankruptcy he found a job at the h sugrue 2003 , pp ketchum again urged cayce to join a business company he preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis , but only the doctors in hopkinsville would cooperate , whereas most of the patients were not in that locality edgar cayce , and especially gertrude , still did not give therapeutic priority to the readings and supposedly lost their second child due to this reticence shortly after this , in 1912 , cayce , whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings , discovered that ketchum had not been honest about them , and had also used them to gamble for finance cayce quit the company immediately and went back to the tresslar photography firm in selma , alabama cayce 's work grew in volume as his fame grew he asked for voluntary donations to support himself and his family so that he could practice full-time even though cayce was reluctant to help them , he was persuaded to give his readings , which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful a cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market ; however , despite his poor finances , cayce refused the merchant 's offer some wanted to know where to hunt for treasures while others wanted to know the outcome of horse races cayce was told by lammers that , while in his trance state , he spoke of lammers ' past lives and of reincarnation , something lammers believed in because of this , cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced he challenged lammers ' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue : : cayce : i said all that ? : insofar as this entity is concerned , this is the third appearance on this plane , and before this one , as the monk lammers had come to him with quite a bit of information of his own to share with cayce and seemed intent upon convincing cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs because cayce 's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923 , it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings lammers asked cayce to come to dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings cayce eventually agreed and went to dayton there , cayce produced much metaphysical information , which cayce tried to reconcile with christianity lammers wanted to ask the purpose of readings of cayce 's clairvoyance , and to put up money for an organization supporting cayce 's healing methods cayce decided to accept the work and asked his family to join him in dayton as soon as they could but by the time the cayces had arrived there , near the end of 1923 , lammers found himself in financial difficulties and could be of no use many people viewed cayce as of no use his remedies were coming under the scrutiny of the american medical association and cayce felt that it was time to legitimize the operations with the aid of licensed medical practitioners in 1925 cayce

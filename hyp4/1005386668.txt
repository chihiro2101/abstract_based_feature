sleep a little 'they ' could help him in fact , he could repeat anything in the book eventually , cayce used all his school books that way by 1892 , the teacher regarded cayce as his best student his

kentucky , and occupied 705 west seventh on the southeast corner of seventh and young streets cayce 's education stopped in the ninth grade because his family could not afford the costs involved much of the remainder of cayce 's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money on march 14 , 1897 , cayce became engaged to gertrude evans throughout his life , cayce was drawn to church as a member of the disciples of christ he read the bible once a year every year , taught at sunday school , and recruited missionaries he said he could see auras around people , spoke to angels , and heard voices of departed relatives in his early years , he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source he then decided to take up the trade of photography , an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice he began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of w bowles in hopkinsville , and eventually became quite talented in his trade hart heard about cayce 's condition and offered to attempt a cure the only local hypnotist , al layne , offered to help cayce restore his voice sugrue 2003 , pp '' after 20 minutes , cayce , still in a trance , declared the treatment over layne asked cayce to describe layne 's own ailments and suggest cures , and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep , and whether the remedies were safe he also told layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant layne described cayce 's method as , '' cayce was still reticent and worried , as '' one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer '' cayce soon became famous , and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence in may 1902 he got a bookshop job in the town of bowling green where he boarded with some young professionals , two of whom were doctors cayce and gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could , greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in bowling green , while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon , with cayce ’ s co-operation however , cayce refused a lucrative offer to go into business after a violent examination by doctors while in a trance , cayce refused any more investigations , declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings in 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios , leading to bankruptcy he again refused an offer to go into business , this time with homeopath wesley h ketchum from hopkinsville , who was introduced by his father when asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method , they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind sugrue 2003 , pp instead the company was to furnish him with a photographic studio for his livelihood , and build a separate office for the readings the contract was modified to give 50 % of the earnings to cayce and his father cayce read the back readings , but they contained so many technical terms that he gained no more understanding of what he was doing shortly after this , in 1912 , cayce , whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings , discovered that ketchum had not been honest about them , and had also used them to gamble for finance he argued in defense that the medical profession were not backing them sugrue 2003 , pp he continued to work in an apparent trance state with a hypnotist all his life his wife and eldest son later replaced layne in this role even though cayce was reluctant to help them , he was persuaded to give his readings , which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful cayce was told by lammers that , while in his trance state , he spoke of lammers ' past lives and of reincarnation , something lammers believed in reincarnation was a popular subject of the day but is not an accepted part of christian doctrine because of this , cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced he challenged lammers ' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue : : cayce : i said all that ? : insofar as this entity is concerned , this is the third appearance on this plane , and before this one , as the monk lammers had come to him with quite a bit of information of his own to share with cayce and seemed intent upon convincing cayce now that he felt the reading had confirmed his strongly-held beliefs because cayce 's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923 , it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings 1923–1925 : dayton , ohio period lammers asked cayce to come to dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings lammers declared that the fifth chapter of matthew was the constitution of christianity and the sermon on the mount was its declaration of independence it appeared that cayce 's subconscious mind was as much at home with the language of metaphysics as it was with the language of anatomy and medicine cayce decided to accept the work and asked his family to join him in dayton as soon as they could but by the time the cayces had arrived there , near the end of 1923 , lammers found himself in financial difficulties and could be of no use many people viewed cayce as of no use cayce used his knowledge of the bible to convince his family that the word of the bible agreed with reincarnation and other metaphysical teachings in 1925 cayce reported while in a trance , '' the voice '' had instructed him to move to virginia beach , virginia across the street from the beach the association continued the work of classifying and cross-referencing the over 14,000 files of readings that had been taken throughout cayce 's lifetime from march 31 , 1901 , to september 17 , 1944 edgarcayce.org other abilities that have been attributed to cayce include astral projection , prophecy , mediumship , viewing the akashic records or '' book of life '' , and seeing auras to treat patients he used spinal manipulation as well as red bug juice and oil of smoke in his cures a reading that cayce gave for rhine 's daughter was notably inaccurate traditional christians are critical of cayce 's views on issues such as reincarnation , oneness , and the akashic records

'saw ' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered , and asked him what he wanted most of all he was frightened , but he said that most of all he wanted to help others , especially sick children the next night , after a complaint from the school teacher , his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling , eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation he begged for a rest and put his head on the spelling book his father thought he had been fooling before and knocked him out of the chair again eventually , cayce used all his school books that way sugrue 2003 , pp by 1892 , the teacher regarded cayce as his best student his father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around , resulting in cayce becoming '' different '' from his peers shortly after this , cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep he was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game , after which he began to act very strangely , and eventually was put to bed he went to sleep and diagnosed the cure , which his family prepared and which cured him as he slept his father boasted that his son was , '' the greatest fellow in the world when he 's asleep '' the owner , thinking it may be time to break the animal in again , attempted to mount it but was immediately thrown off cayce 's education stopped in the ninth grade because his family could not afford the costs involved much of the remainder of cayce 's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money he said he could see auras around people , spoke to angels , and heard voices of departed relatives in his early years , he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source unable to work , he lived at home with his parents for almost a year he then decided to take up the trade of photography , an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice cayce 's voice allegedly returned while in a hypnotic trance but disappeared on awakening the only local hypnotist , al layne , offered to help cayce restore his voice 116–120 in subsequent sessions , when cayce wanted to indicate that the connection was made to the person or the '' entity '' that was requesting the reading , he would generally start off with , '' we have the body layne asked cayce to describe layne 's own ailments and suggest cures , and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective layne suggested that cayce offer his trance healing to the public cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep , and whether the remedies were safe he finally agreed , on the condition that readings would be free given only the person 's name and location , cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed '' the entity '' , and then provide a remedy cayce was still reticent and worried , as '' one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer '' there was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane , or at least that their health suffered sugrue 2003 , pp he lost his voice while there and layne came to help effect the normal cure , finally visiting every week a few days later layne revealed the activity to the professionals at the boarding house , one of whom was a magistrate and journalist , after which state medical authorities forced layne to close his practice cayce and gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could , greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors all the experiments confirmed the accuracy of the readings however , cayce refused a lucrative offer to go into business after a violent examination by doctors while in a trance , cayce refused any more investigations , declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings he became debt free by 1909 , although completely broke , and ready to start again he again refused an offer to go into business , this time with homeopath wesley h when asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method , they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind sugrue 2003 , pp after soul searching the whole night , cayce finally accepted the offer under certain conditions , including that he did not take money for the readings he preferred to put the readings on a more scientific basis , but only the doctors in hopkinsville would cooperate , whereas most of the patients were not in that locality also , doctors from all specialties were needed as the treatments prescribed varied widely when gertrude became fatally ill with tuberculosis , they used the readings after the doctor had given up shortly after this , in 1912 , cayce , whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings , discovered that ketchum had not been honest about them , and had also used them to gamble for finance cayce quit the company immediately and went back to the tresslar photography firm in selma , alabama sugrue 2003 , pp even though cayce was reluctant to help them , he was persuaded to give his readings , which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful a cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market ; however , despite his poor finances , cayce refused the merchant 's offer some wanted to know where to hunt for treasures while others wanted to know the outcome of horse races in 1923 , arthur lammers , a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics , persuaded cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects reincarnation was a popular subject of the day but is not an accepted part of christian doctrine you see , i have been studying metaphysics for years , and i was able by a few questions , by the facts you gave , to check what is right and what is wrong with a whole lot of the stuff i 've been reading the body is only the vehicle ever of that spirit and soul that waft through all times and ever remain the same twelve years earlier cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation in reading 4841–1 , given april 22 , 1911 , cayce referred to the soul being '' transmigrated '' because cayce 's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923 , it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings lammers asked cayce to come to dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings cayce eventually agreed and went to dayton sugrue 2003 , pp but by the time the cayces had arrived there , near the end of 1923 , lammers found himself in financial difficulties and could be of no use many people viewed cayce as of no use in 1925 cayce reported while in a trance , '' the voice '' had instructed him to move to virginia beach , virginia across the street from the beach the idea of an association and a hospital was mooted again , but the readings insisted on virginia beach , not suiting most of the people he bought them a house at virginia beach this would manage building the hospital and a scientific study of the readings morton was president and his brother and several others were vice

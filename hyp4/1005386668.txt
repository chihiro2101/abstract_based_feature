edgar cayce was born on march 18 , 1877 , near beverly , south of hopkinsville , kentucky he was one of six children of farmers carrie elizabeth ( n√©e major ) and leslie burr cayce as a child , he played with the 'little folk ' and was alleged to have seen his deceased grandfather he regarded them all as incorporeal because he could see through them if he looked hard enough he found it very difficult to keep his mind on his lessons at school he was taken to church when he was 10 , and from then he read the bible , becoming engrossed , and completing a dozen readings by the time he was 12 in may 1889 , while reading the bible in his hut in the woods , he 'saw ' a woman with wings who told him that his prayers were answered , and asked him what he wanted most of all he was frightened , but he said that most of all he wanted to help others , especially sick children he decided he would like to be a missionary the next night , after a complaint from the school teacher , his father ruthlessly tested him for spelling , eventually knocking him out of his chair with exasperation at that point , cayce 'heard ' the voice of the lady who had appeared the day before she told him that if he could sleep a little 'they ' could help him when his father came back into the room and woke him up , he knew all the answers in fact , he could repeat anything in the book eventually , cayce used all his school books that way on being questioned , cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books his father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around , resulting in cayce becoming '' different '' from his peers he went to sleep and diagnosed the cure , which his family prepared and which cured him as he slept his father boasted that his son was , '' the greatest fellow in the world when he 's asleep '' the owner , thinking it may be time to break the animal in again , attempted to mount it but was immediately thrown off cayce left for his family in the city that evening in december 1893 , the cayce family moved to hopkinsville , kentucky , and occupied 705 west seventh on the southeast corner of seventh and young streets much of the remainder of cayce 's younger years would be characterized by a search for both employment and money on march 14 , 1897 , cayce became engaged to gertrude evans he said he could see auras around people , spoke to angels , and heard voices of departed relatives in his early years , he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source he began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of w hart heard about cayce 's condition and offered to attempt a cure cayce 's voice allegedly returned while in a hypnotic trance but disappeared on awakening apparently , relapses occurred , but were said to have been corrected by layne in the same way , where eventually the cure was permanent layne asked cayce to describe layne 's own ailments and suggest cures , and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep , and whether the remedies were safe a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance '' reports of cayce 's work appeared in the newspapers , which inspired many postal inquiries cayce was still reticent and worried , as '' one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer '' there was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane , or at least that their health suffered cayce , still worried , kept the meetings secret , and continued to refuse money for his readings he still refused to give readings for money sugrue 2003 , pp cayce and gertrude evans married on june 17 , 1903 , and she moved to bowling green with him cayce and gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could , greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors however , cayce refused a lucrative offer to go into business between the two fires , his first son was born on march 16 , 1907 he became debt free by 1909 , although completely broke , and ready to start again in 1907 , outstanding diagnostic successes in the family helped his confidence when asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method , they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind the contract was modified to give 50 % of the earnings to cayce and his father also , doctors from all specialties were needed as the treatments prescribed varied widely edgar cayce , and especially gertrude , still did not give therapeutic priority to the readings and supposedly lost their second child due to this reticence shortly after this , in 1912 , cayce , whose everyday conscious mind was not aware during the readings , discovered that ketchum had not been honest about them , and had also used them to gamble for finance he argued in defense that the medical profession were not backing them cayce quit the company immediately and went back to the tresslar photography firm in selma , alabama sugrue 2003 , pp cayce 's work grew in volume as his fame grew some wanted to know where to hunt for treasures while others wanted to know the outcome of horse races in 1923 , arthur lammers , a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics , persuaded cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects cayce was told by lammers that , while in his trance state , he spoke of lammers ' past lives and of reincarnation , something lammers believed in because of this , cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced he challenged lammers ' charge that he had validated astrology and reincarnation in the following dialogue : : cayce : i said all that ? i could n't have said all that in one reading the body is only the vehicle ever of that spirit and soul that waft through all times and ever remain the same twelve years earlier cayce had briefly alluded to reincarnation because cayce 's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923 , it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings lammers asked cayce to come to dayton to pursue metaphysical truth via the readings gertrude cayce was dubious but interested lammers wanted to ask the purpose of readings of cayce 's clairvoyance , and to put up money for an organization supporting cayce 's healing methods cayce decided to accept the work and asked his family to join him in dayton as soon as they could sugrue 2003 , pp hugh lynn narrowed the mailing list to some 300 members who were genuinely enthusiastic , and as a result the first annual congress of the association was held in june 1932 the results of these have been disseminated through the association 's publications with the members as the recipients of this material medical health experts are critical of cayce 's unorthodox treatments , which they regard as quackery a reading that cayce gave for rhine 's daughter was notably inaccurate edgar cayce on atlantis , new york : hawthorn , 1968 , cerminara , gina the sleeping prophet , bantam books ,

teacher regarded cayce as his best student on being questioned , cayce told the teacher that he saw pictures of the pages in the books his father became proud of this accomplishment and spread it around , resulting in cayce becoming '' different '' from his peers shortly after this , cayce exhibited an ability to diagnose in his sleep he was struck on the base of the spine by a ball in a school game , after which he began to act very strangely , and eventually was put to bed however , this ability was not demonstrated again for several years sugrue 2003 , p cayce 's uncommon personality is also shown in an unusual incident in which he rode a certain mule back to the farmhouse at the end of a work day the owner , thinking it may be time to break the animal in again ,

christ in his early years , he agonized over whether these psychic abilities were spiritually delivered from the highest source unable to work , he lived at home with his parents for almost a year he then decided to take up the trade of photography , an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice he began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of w bowles in hopkinsville , and eventually became quite talented in his trade hart tried a posthypnotic suggestion that the voice would continue to function after the trance , but this proved unsuccessful the only local hypnotist , al layne , offered to help cayce restore his voice 116–120 in subsequent sessions , when cayce wanted to indicate that the connection was made to the person or the '' entity '' that was requesting the reading , he would generally start off with , '' we have the body '' after 20 minutes , cayce , still in a trance , declared the treatment over apparently , relapses occurred , but were said to have been corrected by layne in the same way , where eventually the cure was permanent layne suggested that cayce offer his trance healing to the public cayce was reluctant as he had no idea what he was prescribing while asleep , and whether the remedies were safe he also told layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant he began , with layne 's help , to offer free treatments to the townspeople layne described cayce 's method as , '' a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance '' reports of cayce 's work appeared in the newspapers , which inspired many postal inquiries cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room given only the person 's name and location , cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed '' the entity '' , and then provide a remedy cayce was still reticent and worried , as '' one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer '' few people knew what he was up to there was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane , or at least that their health suffered he lost his voice while there and layne came to help effect the normal cure , finally visiting every week cayce , still worried , kept the meetings secret , and continued to refuse money for his readings cayce and gertrude evans married on june 17 , 1903 , and she moved to bowling green with him the virginian pilot ( obituaries ) feb 19 , 2013 she still disapproved of the readings , and cayce still agonized over the morality of them he left to acquire osteopathic qualifications in franklin cayce and gertrude accepted the resulting publicity as best they could , greatly aided by the diplomacy of the young doctors cayce and a relative opened a photographic studio in bowling green , while the doctors formed a committee with some colleagues to investigate the phenomenon , with cayce ’ s co-operation after a violent examination by doctors while in a trance , cayce refused any more investigations , declaring that he would only do readings for those who needed help and believed in the readings in 1906 and 1907 fires burned down his two photographic studios , leading to bankruptcy he again refused an offer to go into business , this time with homeopath wesley h ketchum from hopkinsville , who was introduced by his father he found a job at the h when asked the mechanism of the readings via the sleep method , they were told that it happened via the capabilities of the subconscious mind ketchum again urged cayce to join a business company after soul searching the whole night , cayce finally accepted the offer under certain conditions , including that he did not take money for the readings instead the company was to furnish him with a photographic studio for his livelihood , and build a separate office for the readings the contract was modified to give 50 % of the earnings to cayce and his father cayce read the back readings , but they contained so many technical terms that he gained no more understanding of what he was doing . 1912–1923 : selma , alabama period cayce 's work grew in volume as his fame grew he asked for voluntary donations to support himself and his family so that he could practice full-time his wife and eldest son later replaced layne in this role even though cayce was reluctant to help them , he was persuaded to give his readings , which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful in 1923 , arthur lammers , a wealthy printer and student of metaphysics , persuaded cayce to give readings on philosophical subjects because of this , cayce questioned his stenographer about what he said in his trance state and remained unconvinced because cayce 's readings were not systematically recorded until 1923 , it is possible that he may have mentioned reincarnation in other earlier readings hugh lynn continued to build files of case histories , parallel studies in psychic phenomena , and research readings for the study groups edgar cayce : an american prophet , sidney kirkpatrick , 2000 gina cerminara published books such as many mansions and the world within the majority of the book investigated cases where cayce 's readings were demonstrably incorrect medical health experts are critical of cayce 's unorthodox

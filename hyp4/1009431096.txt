test cards typically contain a set of patterns to enable television cameras and receivers to be adjusted to show the picture correctly ( see smpte color bars ) most modern test cards include a set of calibrated colour bars which will produce a characteristic pattern of '' dot landings '' on a vectorscope , allowing chroma and tint to be precisely adjusted between generations of videotape or network feeds smpte bars—and several other test cards—include analog black ( a flat waveform at 7.5 ire , or the ntsc setup level ) , full white ( 100 ire ) , and a '' sub-black '' , or '' blacker-than-black '' ( at 0 ire ) , which represents the lowest low-frequency transmission voltage permissible in ntsc broadcasts ( though the negative excursions of the colourburst signal may go below 0 ire ) there are a variety of different test patterns , each testing a specific technical parameter : gradient monotone bars for testing brightness and colour ; a crosshatch pattern for aspect ratio , alignment , focus , and convergence ; and a single-pixel border for overscan and dimensions image : indian head test pattern labeled.png thumb 260px the famous rca indian-head test pattern used mainly in north america from 1940 to the 1970s with its elements labeled , describing the use of each element in aligning a black & white analog tv receiver formerly a common sight , test cards are now only rarely seen outside of television studios , post-production , and distribution facilities ) on the other hand , digital test signal generators do include test signals which are intended to stress the digital interface , and many sophisticated generators allow the insertion of jitter , bit errors , and other pathological conditions that can cause a digital interface to fail in north america , most test cards such as the famous indian-head test pattern of the 1950s and 1960s have long been relegated to history rather than physical test cards , which had to be televised using a camera , television stations often used a special purpose camera tube which had the test pattern painted on the inside screen of the tube the test card circle details of the uk 's trade test transmissions including the history of the bbc and ita test cards , a look at the music used and full details about the trade test colour films shown from the late fifties to 1973 japanese monochrome test cards – picture gallery of monochrome test cards used in japan in the 1950s , in japanese language only

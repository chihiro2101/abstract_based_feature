kerogen is formed during sedimentary diagenesis from the degradation of living matter the original organic matter can comprise lacustrine and marine algae and plankton and terrestrial higher-order plants , proteins , lipids , and carbohydrates in the original organic matter decompose partially or completely the formation of geopolymers in this way accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen during the process of maturity ( geology ) , kerogen breaks down in high-temperature pyrolysis reactions to form lower-molecular-weight products including bitumen , oil , and gas these generated species are partially expelled from the kerogen-rich source rock and in some cases can charge into a reservoir rock much of the porosity in these shales is found to be hosted within the kerogen , rather than between mineral grains as occurs in conventional reservoir rocks kerogen is a complex mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up the most abundant fraction of organic matter in sedimentary rocks as kerogen is a mixture of organic materials , it is not defined by a single chemical formula kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents in part because of its high molecular mass of its component compounds the chemical composition of kerogen has been analyzed by several forms of solid state spectroscopy these experiments typically measure the speciations ( bonding environments ) of different types of atoms in kerogen it is found that the oxygen content of kerogen decreases during thermal maturation ( as has also been observed by elemental analysis ) , with relatively little observable change in oxygen speciation this variation in starting material may lead to variations in composition between different kerogen particles , leading to spatial heterogeneity in kerogen composition at the micron length scale this classification was developed originally for coal ( a sedimentary rock that is rich in organic matter of terrestrial origin ) but is now applied to the study of other kerogen-rich sedimentary deposits type iv kerogen comprises mostly inert organic matter in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons kerogen materials have been detected also in interstellar medium around stars

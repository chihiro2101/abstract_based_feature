resulting changes in the burial temperatures and pressures lead to further changes in kerogen composition including loss of hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and their associated functional groups , and subsequent isomerization and aromatization such changes are indicative of the thermal maturity state of kerogen aromatization allows for molecular stacking in sheets , which in turn drives changes in physical characteristics of kerogen , such as increasing molecular density , vitrinite reflectance , and spore coloration ( yellow to orange to brown to black with increasing depth/thermal maturity ) the extent of thermal maturation controls the nature of the product , with lower thermal maturities yielding mainly bitumen/oil and higher thermal maturities yielding gas these generated species are partially expelled from the kerogen-rich source rock and in some cases can charge into a reservoir rock kerogen is a complex mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up the most abundant fraction of organic matter in sedimentary rocks for example , kerogen from the green river formation oil shale deposit of western north america contains elements in the proportions carbon 215 : hydrogen 330 : oxygen 12 : nitrogen 5 : sulfur 1 shales that are rich in kerogen but have not been heated to required temperature to generate hydrocarbons instead may form oil shale deposits these experiments typically measure the speciations ( bonding environments ) of different types of atoms in kerogen the relative spectral position ( raman shift ) and intensity of these carbon species is shown to correlate to thermal maturity , with kerogens of higher thermal maturity having higher abundance of graphitic/ordered aromatic carbons complementary and consistent results have been obtained with infrared spectroscopy , which show that kerogen has higher fraction of aromatic carbon and shorter lengths of aliphatic chains at higher thermal maturities similarly , sulfur speciation can be investigated with x-ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) spectroscopy , which is sensitive to sulfur-containing functional groups such as sulfides , thiophenes , and sulfoxides the microstructure of kerogen also evolves during thermal maturation , as has been inferred by scanning electron microscope ( sem ) imaging showing the presence of abundant internal pore networks within the lattice of thermally mature kerogen this evolution is consistent with the change in carbon speciation from predominantly aliphatic ( similar to wax , density 2 g/ml ) with increasing thermal maturity these results indicate that all macerals decrease in oxygen content and increase in aromaticity ( decrease in aliphalicity ) during thermal maturation , but some macerals undergo large changes while other macerals undergo relatively small changes in addition , macerals that are richer in aromatic carbon are mechanically stiffer than macerals that are richer in aliphatic carbon , as expected because highly aromatic forms of carbon ( such as graphite ) are stiffer than highly aliphatic forms of carbon ( such as wax ) , oil ) , refractory kerogen breaks down to generate principally gaseous hydrocarbons , and inert kerogen generates no hydrocarbons but forms graphite type iv kerogen comprises mostly inert organic matter in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

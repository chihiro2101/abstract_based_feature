kerogen is formed during sedimentary diagenesis from the degradation of living matter the original organic matter can comprise lacustrine and marine algae and plankton and terrestrial higher-order plants , proteins , lipids , and carbohydrates in the original organic matter decompose partially or completely the formation of geopolymers in this way accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen during the process of maturity ( geology ) , kerogen breaks down in high-temperature pyrolysis reactions to form lower-molecular-weight products including bitumen , oil , and gas thus , kerogen controls much of the storage and transport of oil and gas in shale kerogen is a complex mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up the most abundant fraction of organic matter in sedimentary rocks as kerogen is a mixture of organic materials , it is not defined by a single chemical formula its chemical composition varies substantially between and even within sedimentary formations kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents in part because of its high molecular mass of its component compounds when such kerogens are present in high concentration in rocks such as organic-rich mudrocks shale , they form possible source rocks shales that are rich in kerogen but have not been heated to required temperature to generate hydrocarbons instead may form oil shale deposits the chemical composition of kerogen has been analyzed by several forms of solid state spectroscopy , oil ) , refractory kerogen breaks down to generate principally gaseous hydrocarbons , and inert kerogen generates no hydrocarbons but forms graphite the van krevelen diagram is one method of classifying kerogen by 'types ' , where kerogens form distinct groups when the ratios of hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon are compared this kerogen is rich in lipid-derived material and is commonly , but not always , from algal organic matter in lacustrine ( freshwater ) environments type iv kerogen comprises mostly inert organic matter in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

kerogen is formed during sedimentary diagenesis from the degradation of living matter the formation of geopolymers in this way accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen during the process of maturity ( geology ) , kerogen breaks down in high-temperature pyrolysis reactions to form lower-molecular-weight products including bitumen , oil , and gas much of the porosity in these shales is found to be hosted within the kerogen , rather than between mineral grains as occurs in conventional reservoir rocks thus , kerogen controls much of the storage and transport of oil and gas in shale kerogen is a complex mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up the most abundant fraction of organic matter in sedimentary rocks for example , kerogen from the green river formation oil shale deposit of western north america contains elements in the proportions carbon 215 : hydrogen 330 : oxygen 12 : nitrogen 5 : sulfur 1 kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents in part because of its high molecular mass of its component compounds shales that are rich in kerogen but have not been heated to required temperature to generate hydrocarbons instead may form oil shale deposits these experiments typically measure the speciations ( bonding environments ) of different types of atoms in kerogen it is found that the oxygen content of kerogen decreases during thermal maturation ( as has also been observed by elemental analysis ) , with relatively little observable change in oxygen speciation sulfur content in kerogen generally decreases with thermal maturity , and sulfur speciation includes a mix of sulfides and thiophenes at low thermal maturities and is further enriched in thiophenes at high maturities the microstructure of kerogen also evolves during thermal maturation , as has been inferred by scanning electron microscope ( sem ) imaging showing the presence of abundant internal pore networks within the lattice of thermally mature kerogen for example , the skeletal density of kerogen increases from approximately 1.1 g/ml at low thermal maturity to 1.7 g/ml at high thermal maturity , oil ) , refractory kerogen breaks down to generate principally gaseous hydrocarbons , and inert kerogen generates no hydrocarbons but forms graphite this kerogen is rich in lipid-derived material and is commonly , but not always , from algal organic matter in lacustrine ( freshwater ) environments type iv kerogen comprises mostly inert organic matter in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

kerogen is formed during sedimentary diagenesis from the degradation of living matter the formation of geopolymers in this way accounts for the large molecular weights and diverse chemical compositions associated with kerogen when kerogen is contemporaneously deposited with geologic material , subsequent sedimentation and progressive burial or overburden provide elevated pressure and temperature owing to lithostatic and geothermal gradients in earth 's crust resulting changes in the burial temperatures and pressures lead to further changes in kerogen composition including loss of hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and their associated functional groups , and subsequent isomerization and aromatization such changes are indicative of the thermal maturity state of kerogen aromatization allows for molecular stacking in sheets , which in turn drives changes in physical characteristics of kerogen , such as increasing molecular density , vitrinite reflectance , and spore coloration ( yellow to orange to brown to black with increasing depth/thermal maturity ) during the process of maturity ( geology ) , kerogen breaks down in high-temperature pyrolysis reactions to form lower-molecular-weight products including bitumen , oil , and gas kerogen is a complex mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up the most abundant fraction of organic matter in sedimentary rocks for example , kerogen from the green river formation oil shale deposit of western north america contains elements in the proportions carbon 215 : hydrogen 330 : oxygen 12 : nitrogen 5 : sulfur 1 kerogen is insoluble in normal organic solvents in part because of its high molecular mass of its component compounds & nbsp ; 150–200 & nbsp ; °c , both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated ) some types of kerogen release crude oil or natural gas , collectively known as hydrocarbons ( fossil fuels ) shales that are rich in kerogen but have not been heated to required temperature to generate hydrocarbons instead may form oil shale deposits the chemical composition of kerogen has been analyzed by several forms of solid state spectroscopy the relative spectral position ( raman shift ) and intensity of these carbon species is shown to correlate to thermal maturity , with kerogens of higher thermal maturity having higher abundance of graphitic/ordered aromatic carbons complementary and consistent results have been obtained with infrared spectroscopy , which show that kerogen has higher fraction of aromatic carbon and shorter lengths of aliphatic chains at higher thermal maturities for example , the skeletal density of kerogen increases from approximately 1.1 g/ml at low thermal maturity to 1.7 g/ml at high thermal maturity measurements performed with atomic force microscopy coupled to infrared spectroscopy ( afm-ir ) and correlated with organic petrography have analyzed the evolution of the chemical composition and mechanical properties of individual macerals of kerogen with thermal maturation at the nanoscale european association of organic geochemists organic geochemistry ( journal ) animation illustrating kerogene formation ( approx t 50s ) '' oil and gas formation '' youtube clip by earthscience westernaustralia

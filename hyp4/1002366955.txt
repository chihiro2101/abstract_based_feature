kerogen is formed during sedimentary diagenesis from the degradation of living matter , proteins , lipids , and carbohydrates in the original organic matter decompose partially or completely when kerogen is contemporaneously deposited with geologic material , subsequent sedimentation and progressive burial or overburden provide elevated pressure and temperature owing to lithostatic and geothermal gradients in earth 's crust resulting changes in the burial temperatures and pressures lead to further changes in kerogen composition including loss of hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , sulfur , and their associated functional groups , and subsequent isomerization and aromatization such changes are indicative of the thermal maturity state of kerogen during the process of maturity ( geology ) , kerogen breaks down in high-temperature pyrolysis reactions to form lower-molecular-weight products including bitumen , oil , and gas the extent of thermal maturation controls the nature of the product , with lower thermal maturities yielding mainly bitumen/oil and higher thermal maturities yielding gas kerogen is a complex mixture of organic chemical compounds that make up the most abundant fraction of organic matter in sedimentary rocks for example , kerogen from the green river formation oil shale deposit of western north america contains elements in the proportions carbon 215 : hydrogen 330 : oxygen 12 : nitrogen 5 : sulfur 1 & nbsp ; 150–200 & nbsp ; °c , both depending on how quickly the source rock is heated ) some types of kerogen release crude oil or natural gas , collectively known as hydrocarbons ( fossil fuels ) when such kerogens are present in high concentration in rocks such as organic-rich mudrocks shale , they form possible source rocks shales that are rich in kerogen but have not been heated to required temperature to generate hydrocarbons instead may form oil shale deposits nmr experiments have found that carbon in kerogen can range from almost entirely aliphatic ( orbital hybridisation sp3 ) to almost entirely aromatic ( orbital hybridisation sp2 ) , with kerogens of higher thermal maturity typically having higher abundance of aromatic carbon this evolution is consistent with the change in carbon speciation from predominantly aliphatic ( similar to wax , density 2 g/ml ) with increasing thermal maturity this variation in starting material may lead to variations in composition between different kerogen particles , leading to spatial heterogeneity in kerogen composition at the micron length scale , oil ) , refractory kerogen breaks down to generate principally gaseous hydrocarbons , and inert kerogen generates no hydrocarbons but forms graphite the van krevelen diagram is one method of classifying kerogen by 'types ' , where kerogens form distinct groups when the ratios of hydrogen to carbon and oxygen to carbon are compared european association of organic geochemists organic geochemistry ( journal ) animation illustrating kerogene formation ( approx t 50s ) '' oil and gas formation '' youtube clip by earthscience westernaustralia

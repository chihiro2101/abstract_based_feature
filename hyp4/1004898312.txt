magnesium oxide is produced by the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide : mg 2+ + ca ( oh ) 2 → mg ( oh ) 2 + ca 2+ calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity calcining temperatures 1000 – 1500 & nbsp ; °c produce hard-burned magnesia , which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature , ( 700–1000 & nbsp ; °c ) produces light-burned magnesia , a reactive form , also known as caustic calcined magnesia although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 & nbsp ; °c , the resulting materials appears to reabsorb carbon dioxide from the air as a construction material , magnesium oxide wallboards have several attractive characteristics : fire resistance , termite resistance , moisture resistance , mold and mildew resistance , and strength most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations , therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility additionally , magnesium , an essential element to most biological systems , is provided to soil and groundwater microbial populations during mgo-assisted metals remediation as an added benefit magnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and dyspepsia , as an antacid , magnesium supplement , and as a short-term laxative it was historically used as a reference white color in colorimetry , owing to its good diffusing and reflectivity properties the electrical heating industry also experimented with aluminium oxide , but it is not used anymore lehvoss.de an aerosolized solution of mgo is used in library science and collections management for the deacidification of at-risk paper items magnesium oxide is used as an oxide barrier in spin-tunneling devices calcium oxide barium oxide magnesium sulfide reactive magnesia

magnesium oxide is produced by the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide : mg 2+ + ca ( oh ) 2 → mg ( oh ) 2 + ca 2+ calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity high temperatures 1500 – 2000 & nbsp ; °c diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned ( often called dead burnt ) magnesia , an unreactive form used as a refractory although some decomposition of the carbonate to oxide occurs at temperatures below 700 & nbsp ; °c , the resulting materials appears to reabsorb carbon dioxide from the air '' by far the largest consumer of magnesia worldwide is the refractory industry , which consumed about 56 & nbsp ; % of the magnesia in the united states in 2004 , the remaining 44 & nbsp ; % being used in agricultural , chemical , construction , environmental , and other industrial applications as a construction material , magnesium oxide wallboards have several attractive characteristics : fire resistance , termite resistance , moisture resistance , mold and mildew resistance , and strength magnesium oxide is used extensively in the soil and groundwater remediation , wastewater treatment , drinking water treatment , air emissions treatment , and waste treatment industries for its acid buffering capacity and related effectiveness in stabilizing dissolved heavy metal species most metal species are toxic to humans at certain concentrations , therefore it is imperative to minimize metal bioavailability and mobility granular mgo is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material , which is also commonly of a low ( acidic ) ph , in order to drive the ph into the 8–10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities most , if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high ph conditions in aquifers whereas mgo creates an ideal aquifer condition with a ph of 8–10 magnesium oxide for the animal feed industry in this process , the alkalinity of mgo ( and similar compounds ) neutralizes the relatively high acidity characteristic of low-quality paper , thus slowing the rate of deterioration magnesium oxide is used as an oxide barrier in spin-tunneling devices

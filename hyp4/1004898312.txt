magnesium oxide is produced by the calcination of magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide the latter is obtained by the treatment of magnesium chloride solutions , typically seawater , with limewater or milk of lime : mg 2+ + ca ( oh ) 2 → mg ( oh ) 2 + ca 2+ calcining at different temperatures produces magnesium oxide of different reactivity high temperatures 1500 – 2000 & nbsp ; °c diminish the available surface area and produces dead-burned ( often called dead burnt ) magnesia , an unreactive form used as a refractory calcining temperatures 1000 – 1500 & nbsp ; °c produce hard-burned magnesia , which has limited reactivity and calcining at lower temperature , ( 700–1000 & nbsp ; °c ) produces light-burned magnesia , a reactive form , also known as caustic calcined magnesia '' by far the largest consumer of magnesia worldwide is the refractory industry , which consumed about 56 & nbsp ; % of the magnesia in the united states in 2004 , the remaining 44 & nbsp ; % being used in agricultural , chemical , construction , environmental , and other industrial applications as a construction material , magnesium oxide wallboards have several attractive characteristics : fire resistance , termite resistance , moisture resistance , mold and mildew resistance , and strength many heavy metals species , such as lead and cadmium are most soluble in water at acidic ph ( below 6 ) as well as high ph ( above 11 ) granular mgo is often blended into metals-contaminated soil or waste material , which is also commonly of a low ( acidic ) ph , in order to drive the ph into the 8–10 range where most metals are at their lowest solubilities most , if not all products that are marketed as metals stabilization technologies create very high ph conditions in aquifers whereas mgo creates an ideal aquifer condition with a ph of 8–10 magnesium oxide is used for relief of heartburn and dyspepsia , as an antacid , magnesium supplement , and as a short-term laxative magnesium oxide is used as an oxide barrier in spin-tunneling devices calcium oxide barium oxide magnesium sulfide reactive magnesia

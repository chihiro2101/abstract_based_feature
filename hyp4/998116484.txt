in 1942 , the university of ottawa 's english debating society published the inaugural edition of their newsletter , entitled the fulcrum due to its conservative catholic editorial policies , the fulcrum was fairly non-controversial compared to its more outspoken counterpart , la rotonde the inclusion of advertising starting in its second year allowed the paper some slight financial freedom and the fulcrum continued in this manner until 1946 , when it came under the supervision of the english students ' association and the sfuo in 1947 , the fulcrum became a member of the canadian university press , a national cooperative linking student newspapers across canada in 1951 , the sfuo ( suffering from serious financial problems ) proposed that the fulcrum and la rotonde be combined into one publication and renamed the ottawa throughout the 1950s , la rotonde and the university of ottawa administration had a combative relationship , inciting the canadian university press to label la rotonde as '' the most censored student newspaper in canada '' in 1956 both the fulcrum and la rotonde continued to publish unabated throughout most of the 1960s , with la rotonde continuing with its outspoken approach , and the fulcrum often playing the mediator and aiming criticism at both parties however , this began to change in 1964 , when the university of ottawa administration censored an article in la rotonde espousing the opinion that queen elizabeth ii was not welcome in quebec the fulcrum spoke out on the issue and in an editorial at the time stated that : '' we feel that the administration should have given the publishers of la rotonde a chance to act in october 2004 , a letters patent was granted to '' the fulcrum publishing society '' , the corporation that would take over the governance of the fulcrum , and negotiations between the sfuo and the fulcrum continued throughout the year the fulcrum publishing society was set up to be governed by a ten-member board of directors made up of students , community members , fulcrum staff , u of o faculty , and fulcrum alumni after a turbulent first year , the fulcrum settled into a financially stable position as an autonomous corporation most of the fulcrum 's editorial board and staff members were against the boycott

in 1942 , the university of ottawa 's english debating society published the inaugural edition of their newsletter , entitled the fulcrum '' in its first year , the fulcrum was funded almost entirely by alumni donations and published only 8 issues per year due to its conservative catholic editorial policies , the fulcrum was fairly non-controversial compared to its more outspoken counterpart , la rotonde in 1947 , the fulcrum became a member of the canadian university press , a national cooperative linking student newspapers across canada throughout the 1950s , la rotonde and the university of ottawa administration had a combative relationship , inciting the canadian university press to label la rotonde as '' the most censored student newspaper in canada '' in 1956 despite the atmosphere on campus , the fulcrum continued to publish during this time both the fulcrum and la rotonde continued to publish unabated throughout most of the 1960s , with la rotonde continuing with its outspoken approach , and the fulcrum often playing the mediator and aiming criticism at both parties however , this began to change in 1964 , when the university of ottawa administration censored an article in la rotonde espousing the opinion that queen elizabeth ii was not welcome in quebec across from the main campus in a university of ottawa building beginning in the 2003-2004 school year , the paper began referring to itself as university of ottawa 's fulcrum , rather than the fulcrum , on the cover in october 2004 , a letters patent was granted to '' the fulcrum publishing society '' , the corporation that would take over the governance of the fulcrum , and negotiations between the sfuo and the fulcrum continued throughout the year the fulcrum publishing society was set up to be governed by a ten-member board of directors made up of students , community members , fulcrum staff , u of o faculty , and fulcrum alumni to avoid a similar conflict of interest , provisions were put into the corporate bylaws prohibiting the board from interfering in editorial content unless faced with possible legal action

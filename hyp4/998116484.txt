in 1942 , the university of ottawa 's english debating society published the inaugural edition of their newsletter , entitled the fulcrum the premiere edition included as its mission statement the following : '' the fulcrum is dedicated entirely to the interests of our students of today and yesterday the inclusion of advertising starting in its second year allowed the paper some slight financial freedom and the fulcrum continued in this manner until 1946 , when it came under the supervision of the english students ' association and the sfuo in 1947 , the fulcrum became a member of the canadian university press , a national cooperative linking student newspapers across canada in 1951 , the sfuo ( suffering from serious financial problems ) proposed that the fulcrum and la rotonde be combined into one publication and renamed the ottawa the proposal was rejected , but operations at the two papers were condensed into one workspace in the house the sfuo occupied at the time throughout the 1950s , la rotonde and the university of ottawa administration had a combative relationship , inciting the canadian university press to label la rotonde as '' the most censored student newspaper in canada '' in 1956 both the fulcrum and la rotonde continued to publish unabated throughout most of the 1960s , with la rotonde continuing with its outspoken approach , and the fulcrum often playing the mediator and aiming criticism at both parties however , this began to change in 1964 , when the university of ottawa administration censored an article in la rotonde espousing the opinion that queen elizabeth ii was not welcome in quebec it was during this time that the fulcrum moved to offices located between university of ottawa 's thompson residence and morriset library ( later occupied by chuo-fm , and now known as the déjà vu lounge ) beginning in the 2003-2004 school year , the paper began referring to itself as university of ottawa 's fulcrum , rather than the fulcrum , on the cover in october 2004 , a letters patent was granted to '' the fulcrum publishing society '' , the corporation that would take over the governance of the fulcrum , and negotiations between the sfuo and the fulcrum continued throughout the year on march 19 , 2008 , the fulcrum held its annual general meeting , normally a fairly subdued event

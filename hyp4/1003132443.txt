the work was composed after diabelli , a well-known music publisher and composer , in the early part of 1819 sent a waltz of his creation to all the important composers of the austrian empire , including franz schubert , carl czerny , johann nepomuk hummel , and the archduke rudolph , asking each of them to write a variation on it about a slightly earlier period , 1815 , beethoven 's authoritative biographer , alexander wheelock thayer , writes , '' diabelli , born near salzburg in 1781 , had now been for some years one of the more prolific composers of light and pleasing music , and one of the best and most popular teachers in vienna '' at the time of his project for variations on a theme of his own by various composers , diabelli had advanced to become a partner in the publishing firm of cappi and diabelli the oft-told but now questionable story of the origins of this work is that beethoven at first refused categorically to participate in diabelli 's project , dismissing the theme as banal , a schusterfleck or 'cobbler 's patch , ' unworthy of his time ( in another version of the legend , beethoven was so insulted at being asked to work with material he considered beneath him that he wrote 33 variations to demonstrate his prowess its origins are with anton schindler , beethoven 's unreliable biographer , whose account conflicts in a number of ways with several established facts , indicating that he did not have first-hand knowledge of events at some point , beethoven certainly did accept diabelli 's proposal , but rather than contributing a single variation on the theme , he planned a large set of variations 74 carl czerny , a pupil of beethoven , claimed that '' beethoven wrote these variations in a merry freak '' one suggestion on what prompted beethoven to write a set of '' grand variations '' on diabelli 's theme is the influence of the archduke rudolph who , in the previous year , under beethoven 's tutelage , had composed a huge set of forty variations on a theme by beethoven he might have been trying to outdo himself after his 32 variations in c & nbsp ; minor , or trying to outdo bach 's goldberg variations with its total of thirty-two pieces ( two presentations of the theme and thirty variations ) there is a story that diabelli was pressing beethoven to send him his contribution to the project , whereupon beethoven asked , '' how many contributions have you got ? '' '' thirty-two '' , said diabelli

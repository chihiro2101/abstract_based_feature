beethoven had had a connection with diabelli for a number of years about a slightly earlier period , 1815 , beethoven 's authoritative biographer , alexander wheelock thayer , writes , '' diabelli , born near salzburg in 1781 , had now been for some years one of the more prolific composers of light and pleasing music , and one of the best and most popular teachers in vienna the oft-told but now questionable story of the origins of this work is that beethoven at first refused categorically to participate in diabelli 's project , dismissing the theme as banal , a schusterfleck or 'cobbler 's patch , ' unworthy of his time not long afterwards , according to the story , upon learning that diabelli would pay a handsome price for a full set of variations from him , beethoven changed his mind and decided to show how much could be done with such slim materials at some point , beethoven certainly did accept diabelli 's proposal , but rather than contributing a single variation on the theme , he planned a large set of variations 74 carl czerny , a pupil of beethoven , claimed that '' beethoven wrote these variations in a merry freak '' then he laid the work aside for several years – something beethoven rarely did – while he returned to the missa solemnis and the late piano sonatas in june 1822 , beethoven offered to his publisher peters '' variations on a waltz for pianoforte alone ( there are many ) '' one suggestion on what prompted beethoven to write a set of '' grand variations '' on diabelli 's theme is the influence of the archduke rudolph who , in the previous year , under beethoven 's tutelage , had composed a huge set of forty variations on a theme by beethoven there is a story that diabelli was pressing beethoven to send him his contribution to the project , whereupon beethoven asked , '' how many contributions have you got ? '' '' thirty-two '' , said diabelli van beethoven sur une valse de diabelli , a 1971 dialogue between writer michel butor and beethoven

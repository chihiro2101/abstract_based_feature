this means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness , or '' luminance '' , than in color however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image the ntsc color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler ; the 1950s tv sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important modern tv sets can display multiple field rates ( 50 , 59.94 , or 60 , in either interlaced or progressive scan ) while accepting power at various frequencies ( often the operating range is specified as 48–62 & nbsp ; hz ) in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) when displayed together or in rapid succession , these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer to do so without making the images flicker , the refresh time of all three images put together would have to be above the critical limit , and generally the same as a single black and white image one of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth in the united states , after considerable research , the national television systems committee national television system committee ( 1951–1953 ) , report and reports of panel no 11 , 11-a , 12–19 , with some supplementary references cited in the reports , and the petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the federal communications commission , n.p the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image experiments with facsimile image transmission systems that used radio broadcasts to transmit images date to the 19th century early systems generally used a device known as a '' nipkow disk '' , which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image a similar disk was used at the receiver side , with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector a number of such mechanical television systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s in spite of these early successes , all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built the first color television project is claimed by him , western technology and soviet economic development : 1945 to 1965 , by

demonstrations in the u.k mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by bell laboratories in june 1929 using three complete systems of solar cell , amplifiers , glow-tubes , and color filters , with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red , green , and blue images into one full color image as was the case with black-and-white television , an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like baird 's each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems the simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera : arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen , like frosted glass rca built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on february 5 , 1940 ,

phosphors instead of an even coating of white instead , a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror in these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other , in either complete frames in the '' field-sequential color system '' , or for each line in the '' line-sequential '' system in order to avoid this , these systems increased the frame rate considerably , making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards in 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional

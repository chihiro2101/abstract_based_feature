the human eye 's detection system in the retina consists primarily of two types of light detectors : rod cells that capture light , dark , and shapes/figures , and the cone cells that detect color however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image the ntsc color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler ; the 1950s tv sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important modern tv sets can display multiple field rates ( 50 , 59.94 , or 60 , in either interlaced or progressive scan ) while accepting power at various frequencies ( often the operating range is specified as 48–62 & nbsp ; hz ) in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) to do so without making the images flicker , the refresh time of all three images put together would have to be above the critical limit , and generally the same as a single black and white image early plans for color television in the united states included a move from very high frequency ( vhf ) to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) to open up additional spectrum in the united states , after considerable research , the national television systems committee national television system committee ( 1951–1953 ) , report and reports of panel no :54021386 library of congress online catalog approved an all-electronic system developed by rca which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image the ntsc standard represented a major technical achievement a key problem was the need to convert a 2d image into a '' 1d '' radio signal ; some form of image scanning was needed to make this work early systems generally used a device known as a '' nipkow disk '' , which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image a single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot , which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast indeed , baird 's system was demonstrated to members of the royal institution in london in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true , working television system being mechanically driven , perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure , and irregularities could result in major image distortion converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances with these systems , the bbc began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936 , but these were shut down again with the start of world war ii in 1939 in 1936 , under the guidance of the minister of public enlightenment and propaganda , joseph goebbels , direct transmissions from fifteen mobile units at the 1936 summer olympics were transmitted to selected small television houses in berlin and hamburg in 1941 , the first ntsc meetings produced a single standard for us broadcasts the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built polish inventor jan szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897 , using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver 330 and was patented in germany on march 31 , 1908 , patent number 197183 , then in britain , on april 1 , 1908 , patent number 7219 , the history of television , 1880–1941 , by albert abramson , 1987 , p rokhlin , tak rozhdalos ' dal'novidenie ( in russian ) shortly after his practical demonstration of black and white television , on july 3 , 1928 , baird demonstrated the world 's first color transmission this used scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures , each spiral with filters of a different primary color ; and three light sources , controlled by the signal , at the receiving end , with a commutator to alternate their illumination john logie baird , television apparatus and the like , u.s as was the case with black-and-white television , an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like baird 's the obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an rgb signal the problem with this approach was there was no simple way to recombine them on the receiver end if each image was sent at the same time on different frequencies , the images would have to be '' stacked '' somehow on the display , in real time kenyon kilbon , pioneering in electronics : a short history of the origins and growth of rca laboratories , radio corporation of america , 1919 to 1964 , chapter nine – television : monochrome to color , 1964 this system , however , suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set , as well as having very dim pictures , the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era another solution would be to use a single screen , but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white three receivers would be used , each sending its output to a separate electron gun , aimed at its colored phosphor the electron guns used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution , and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays , the guns would have to focus on individual dots three times smaller in these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other , in either complete frames in the '' field-sequential color system '' , or for each line in the '' line-sequential '' system in order to avoid this , these systems increased the frame rate considerably , making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards in 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk goldmark , assignor to columbia broadcasting system , '' color television '' , u.s current broadcasting 1940 '' color television success in test '' , the new york times , august 30 , 1940 , p '' new television system transmits images in full color '' , popular science , december 1940 , p cbs began experimental color field tests using film as early as august 28 , 1940 , and live cameras by november 12 '' television hearing set '' , the new york times , november 13 , 1940 , p nbc ( owned by rca ) made its first field test of color television on february 20 , 1941 cbs began daily color field tests on june 1 , 1941 the war production board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from april 22 , 1942 , to august 20 , 1945 , limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public cbs initiated a limited schedule of color broadcasts from its new york station wcbs-tv mondays to saturdays beginning november 14 , 1950 , making ten color receivers available for the viewing public cbs announces color television ( advertisement ) , new york daily news , november 13 , 1950 , p all were broadcast using the single color camera that cbs owned '' philco offers 11 tv sets to receive cbs color tv in black and white '' , the wall street journal , june 4 , 1951 , p however , rca 's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems , and were easily bested by cbs 's hybrid system at the time that ntsc color broadcasting was officially introduced into canada in 1966 , less than one percent of canadian households had a color television set a color model from westinghouse h840ck15 ( 1,295 , or became available in the new york area on february 28 , 1954 ;

the human eye 's detection system in the retina consists primarily of two types of light detectors : rod cells that capture light , dark , and shapes/figures , and the cone cells that detect color a typical retina contains 120 & nbsp ; million rods and 4.5 & nbsp ; million to 6 & nbsp ; million cones , which are divided into three types , each one with a characteristic profile of excitability by different wavelengths of the spectrum of visible light however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image the eye has limited bandwidth to the rest of the visual system , estimated at just under 8 mbit/s the ntsc color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler ; the 1950s tv sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) early plans for color television in the united states included a move from very high frequency ( vhf ) to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) to open up additional spectrum one of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth 11 , 11-a , 12–19 , with some supplementary references cited in the reports , and the petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the federal communications commission , n.p :54021386 library of congress online catalog approved an all-electronic system developed by rca which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made what we know as television practical early systems generally used a device known as a '' nipkow disk '' , which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image a single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot , which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast the best-known was john logie baird 's , which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in britain for several years indeed , baird 's system was demonstrated to members of the royal institution in london in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true , working television system with these systems , the bbc began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936 , but these were shut down again with the start of world war ii in 1939 by 22 march 1935 , 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the paul nipkow tv station in berlin in 1936 , under the guidance of the minister of public enlightenment and propaganda , joseph goebbels , direct transmissions from fifteen mobile units at the 1936 summer olympics were transmitted to selected small television houses in berlin and hamburg us television broadcasts began in earnest in the immediate post-war era , and by 1950 there were 6 & nbsp ; million televisions in the united states '' television '' , the world book encyclopedia 2003 : 119 the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built among the earliest published proposals for television was one by maurice le blanc in 1880 for a color system , including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning , although he gave no practical details but his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end , and could not have worked as he described it an armenian inventor , hovannes adamian , also experimented with color television as early as 1907 the first color television project is claimed by him , western technology and soviet economic development : 1945 to 1965 , by antony c rokhlin , tak rozhdalos ' dal'novidenie ( in russian ) shortly after his practical demonstration of black and white television , on july 3 , 1928 , baird demonstrated the world 's first color transmission john logie baird , television apparatus and the like , u.s baird television : crystal palace television studios rca built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on february 5 , 1940 , privately shown to members of the us federal communications commission at the rca plant in camden , new jersey kenyon kilbon , pioneering in electronics : a short history of the origins and growth of rca laboratories , radio corporation of america , 1919 to 1964 , chapter nine – television : monochrome to color , 1964 instead , a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror in order to avoid this , these systems increased the frame rate considerably , making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards in 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk current broadcasting 1940 '' color television success in test '' , the new york times , august 30 , 1940 , p '' color television achieves realism '' , the new york times , september 5 , 1940 , p '' new television system transmits images in full color '' , popular science , december 1940 , p cbs began experimental color field tests using film as early as august 28 , 1940 , and live cameras by november 12 '' television hearing set '' , the new york times , november 13 , 1940 , p nbc ( owned by rca ) made its first field test of color television on february 20 , 1941 the war production board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from april 22 , 1942 , to august 20 , 1945 , limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public '' wpb cancels 210 controls ;

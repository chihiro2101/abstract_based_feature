the human eye 's detection system in the retina consists primarily of two types of light detectors : rod cells that capture light , dark , and shapes/figures , and the cone cells that detect color this means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness , or '' luminance '' , than in color however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image the ntsc color system changed from the black-and-white 60-fields-per-second standard to 59.94 fields per second to make the color circuitry simpler ; the 1950s tv sets had matured enough that the power frequency/field rate mismatch was no longer important modern tv sets can display multiple field rates ( 50 , 59.94 , or 60 , in either interlaced or progressive scan ) while accepting power at various frequencies ( often the operating range is specified as 48–62 & nbsp ; hz ) in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) when displayed together or in rapid succession , these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer one of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth in the united states , after considerable research , the national television systems committee national television system committee ( 1951–1953 ) , report and reports of panel no 11 , 11-a , 12–19 , with some supplementary references cited in the reports , and the petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the federal communications commission , n.p the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made what we know as television practical the best-known was john logie baird 's , which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in britain for several years indeed , baird 's system was demonstrated to members of the royal institution in london in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true , working television system in spite of these early successes , all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems the two key advances were philo farnsworth 's electronic scanning system , and vladimir zworykin 's iconoscope camera , played a key role in the development of radar by 22 march 1935 , 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the paul nipkow tv station in berlin us television broadcasts began in earnest in the immediate post-war era , and by 1950 there were 6 & nbsp ; million televisions in the united states the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built le blanc , '' etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses '' , la lumière electrique , vol polish inventor jan szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897 , using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver an armenian inventor , hovannes adamian , also experimented with color television as early as 1907 the first color television project is claimed by him , western technology and soviet economic development : 1945 to 1965 , by antony c as was the case with black-and-white television , an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like baird 's each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems three receivers would be used , each sending its output to a separate electron gun , aimed at its colored phosphor this was beyond the state of the art of the technology at the time instead , a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror in these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other , in either complete frames in the '' field-sequential color system '' , or for each line in the '' line-sequential '' system in 1939 , hungarian engineer peter carl goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at cbs , which contained an iconoscope sensor the cbs field-sequential color system was partly mechanical , with a disc made of red , blue , and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 & nbsp ; rpm , and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set current broadcasting 1940 '' color television success in test '' , the new york times , august 30 , 1940 , p '' new television system transmits images in full color '' , popular science , december 1940 , p '' color television success in test '' , the new york times , august 30 , 1940 , p '' television hearing set '' , the new york times , november 13 , 1940 , p ed reitan , rca-nbc color firsts in television ( commented ) these color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets , and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time , viewing of the color field tests was restricted to rca and cbs engineers and the invited press the war production board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from april 22 , 1942 , to august 20 , 1945 , limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public '' wpb cancels 210 controls ;

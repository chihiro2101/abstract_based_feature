however , post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image in its most basic form , a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images , one each in the three colors of red , green , and blue ( rgb ) when displayed together or in rapid succession , these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer early plans for color television in the united states included a move from very high frequency ( vhf ) to ultra high frequency ( uhf ) to open up additional spectrum one of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth 11 , 11-a , 12–19 , with some supplementary references cited in the reports , and the petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the federal communications commission , n.p :54021386 library of congress online catalog approved an all-electronic system developed by rca which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth the brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution , while color-capable televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display the higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image experiments with facsimile image transmission systems that used radio broadcasts to transmit images date to the 19th century it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made what we know as television practical a single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot , which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast a similar disk was used at the receiver side , with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector a number of such mechanical television systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s the best-known was john logie baird 's , which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in britain for several years indeed , baird 's system was demonstrated to members of the royal institution in london in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true , working television system with these systems , the bbc began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936 , but these were shut down again with the start of world war ii in 1939 by 22 march 1935 , 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the paul nipkow tv station in berlin the basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built polish inventor jan szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897 , using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet

in the u.k as was the case with black-and-white television , an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like baird 's each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems rca built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on february 5 , 1940 , privately shown to members of the us federal communications commission at the rca plant in camden , new jersey zworykin with frederick olessi ,

scanner for pickup this system , however , suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set , as well as having very dim pictures , the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era instead , a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror in 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk this device was very '' deep '' , but was later improved with a mirror

field test of color television on february 20 , 1941 early telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate baird 's demonstration on august 16 , 1944 , was the first example of a practical color television system the geer tube was similar to baird 's concept , but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces , instead of baird 's 3d patterning on a flat surface in the immediate post-war era the federal communications commission ( fcc ) was inundated with requests to set up new television stations , and the fcc started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts the fcc called for technical demonstrations of color systems in 1948 , and the joint technical advisory committee ( jtac ) was formed to study them the jtac still recommended the cbs system , and after the resolution of an ensuing rca lawsuit , color broadcasts using the cbs system started on june 25 , 1951 viewing was again restricted : the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets , and variety estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the new york area most of the remainder of the prototype color receivers were given to advertisers sponsoring the color broadcasts cbs had bought a television manufacturer in april , '' hytron 's deal with cbs seen tv color aid '' , the washington

network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn two days earlier , admiral had demonstrated to their distributors the prototype of admiral 's first color television set planned for consumer sale using the ntsc standards , priced at 1,175 digital terrestrial television standards , such as atsc , dvb-t , dvb-t2 , and isdb , have superseded these analog transmission standards in many countries .

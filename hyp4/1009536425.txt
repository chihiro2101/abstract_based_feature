the f-number n is given by : : n \frac\right ) n , where n is the uncorrected f-number , na i is the image-space numerical aperture of the lens , m is the absolute value of the lens 's magnification for an object a particular distance away , and p is the pupil magnification since the pupil magnification is seldom known it is often assumed to be 1 , which is the correct value for all symmetric lenses in photography this means that as one focuses closer , the lens ' effective aperture becomes smaller , making the exposure darker the working f-number is often described in photography as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor in 1867 , sutton and dawson defined '' apertal ratio '' as essentially the reciprocal of the modern f-number in the following quote , an '' apertal ratio '' of '' '' is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop : in every lens there is , corresponding to a given apertal ratio ( that is , the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length ) , a certain distance of a near object from it , between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range ' of the lens when this stop is used in the same lens , the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used , while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased the terms 'apertal ratio ' and 'focal range ' have not come into general use , but it is very desirable that they should , in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses in 1874 , john henry dallmeyer called the ratio 1/n the '' intensity ratio '' of a lens : the rapidity of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus at the same time , there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture , rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio in modern publications , the forms f-number and f number are more common , though the earlier forms , as well as f-number are still found in a few books ; not uncommonly , the initial lower-case f in f-number or f/number is set in a hooked italic form : f , or f

the f-number n is given by : : n \frac\right ) n , where n is the uncorrected f-number , na i is the image-space numerical aperture of the lens , m is the absolute value of the lens 's magnification for an object a particular distance away , and p is the pupil magnification in photography this means that as one focuses closer , the lens ' effective aperture becomes smaller , making the exposure darker the working f-number is often described in photography as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor in 1867 , sutton and dawson defined '' apertal ratio '' as essentially the reciprocal of the modern f-number in the following quote , an '' apertal ratio '' of '' '' is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop : in every lens there is , corresponding to a given apertal ratio ( that is , the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length ) , a certain distance of a near object from it , between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus the terms 'apertal ratio ' and 'focal range ' have not come into general use , but it is very desirable that they should , in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses in 1874 , john henry dallmeyer called the ratio 1/n the '' intensity ratio '' of a lens : the rapidity of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus although he did not yet have access to ernst abbe 's theory of stops and pupils , which was made widely available by siegfried czapski in 1893 , siegfried czapski , theorie der optischen instrumente , nach abbe , breslau : trewendt , 1893 dallmeyer knew that his working aperture was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop : it must be observed , however , that in order to find the real intensity ratio , the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained at the same time , there were a number of aperture numbering systems designed with the goal of making exposure times vary in direct or inverse proportion with the aperture , rather than with the square of the f-number or inverse square of the apertal ratio or intensity ratio by 1895 , hodges contradicts bothamley , saying that the f-number system has taken over : '' this is called the x system , and the diaphragms of all modern lenses of good construction are so marked he calls the f-number the '' ratio number , '' '' aperture ratio number , '' and '' ratio aperture

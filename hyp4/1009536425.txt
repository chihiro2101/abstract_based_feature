the f-number n is given by : : n \frac\right ) n , where n is the uncorrected f-number , na i is the image-space numerical aperture of the lens , m is the absolute value of the lens 's magnification for an object a particular distance away , and p is the pupil magnification in photography this means that as one focuses closer , the lens ' effective aperture becomes smaller , making the exposure darker the working f-number is often described in photography as the f-number corrected for lens extensions by a bellows factor in 1867 , sutton and dawson defined '' apertal ratio '' as essentially the reciprocal of the modern f-number in the following quote , an '' apertal ratio '' of '' '' is calculated as the ratio of to , corresponding to an f-stop : in every lens there is , corresponding to a given apertal ratio ( that is , the ratio of the diameter of the stop to the focal length ) , a certain distance of a near object from it , between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus stop ( apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth ) , all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it ( a fixed star , for instance ) are in equally good focus in the same lens , the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used , while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased in 1874 , john henry dallmeyer called the ratio 1/n the '' intensity ratio '' of a lens : the rapidity of a lens depends upon the relation or ratio of the aperture to the equivalent focus to ascertain this , divide the equivalent focus by the diameter of the actual working aperture of the lens in question ; and note down the quotient as the denominator with 1 , or unity , for the numerator thus to find the ratio of a lens of 2 inches diameter and 6 inches focus , divide the focus by the aperture , or 6 divided by 2 equals 3 ; i.e dallmeyer knew that his working aperture was not the same as the physical diameter of the aperture stop : it must be observed , however , that in order to find the real intensity ratio , the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained he calls the f-number the '' ratio number , '' '' aperture ratio number , '' and '' ratio aperture

in common parlance , the word fetish is used to refer to any sexually arousing stimuli , not all of which meet the medical criteria for fetishism originally , most medical sources defined fetishism as a sexual interest in non-living objects , body parts or secretions in 1987 , a revised edition of the dsm-iii ( dsm-iii-r ) introduced a new diagnosis for body part arousal , called partialism martin kafka argued that partialism should be merged into fetishism because of overlap between the two conditions , and the dsm-5 subsequently did so in 2013 in a review of 48 cases of clinical fetishism in 1983 , fetishes included clothing ( 58.3 % ) , rubber and rubber items ( 22.9 % ) , footwear ( 14.6 % ) , partialism ( 14.6 % ) , leather ( 10.4 % ) , and soft materials or fabrics ( 6.3 % ) of the groups about body parts or features , 47 % belonged to groups about feet ( podophilia ) , 9 % about body fluids ( including urophilia , scatophilia , lactaphilia , menophilia , mucophilia ) , 9 % about body size , 7 % about hair ( hair fetish ) , and 5 % about muscles ( muscle worship ) less popular groups focused on navels ( navel fetishism ) , legs , body hair , mouth , and nails , among other things of the groups about clothing , 33 % belonged to groups about clothes worn on the legs or buttocks ( such as stockings or skirts ) , 32 % about footwear ( shoe fetishism ) , 12 % about underwear ( underwear fetishism ) , and 9 % about whole-body wear such as jackets less popular object groups focused on headwear , stethoscopes , wristwear , pacifiers , and diapers ( diaper fetishism ) devotism is only a sexual fetish when the person who has the fetish considers the amputated body part on another person the object of sexual interest according to john bancroft , conditioning alone can not explain fetishism , because it does not result in fetishism for most people imprinting seems to occur during the child 's earliest experiences with arousal and desire , and is based on '' an egocentric evaluation of salient reward- or pleasure-related characteristics that differ from one individual to another the icd-10 defines fetishism as a reliance on non-living objects for sexual arousal and satisfaction under the dsm-5 , fetishism is sexual arousal from nonliving objects or specific nongenital body parts , excluding clothes used for cross-dressing ( as that falls under transvestic disorder ) and sex toys that are designed for genital stimulation in order to be diagnosed as fetishistic disorder , the arousal must persist for at least six months and cause significant psychosocial distress or impairment in important areas of their life in the dsm-iv , sexual interest in body parts was distinguished from fetishism under the name partialism ( diagnosed as paraphilia nos ) , but it was merged with fetishistic disorder for the dsm-5 according to the world health organization , fetishistic fantasies are common and should only be treated as a disorder when they impair normal functioning or cause distress another study found that 28 % of men and 11 % of women reported fetishistic arousal ( including feet , fabrics , and objects '' like shoes , gloves , or plush toys '' ) both male and female rats will develop a sexual preference for neutrally or even noxiously scented partners if those scents are paired with their early sexual experiences rats will also develop sexual preferences for the location of their early sexual experiences , and can be conditioned to show increased arousal in the presence of objects such as a plastic toy fish

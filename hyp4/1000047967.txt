in common parlance , the word fetish is used to refer to any sexually arousing stimuli , not all of which meet the medical criteria for fetishism this broader usage of fetish covers parts or features of the body ( including obesity and body modifications ) , objects , situations and activities ( such as smoking or bdsm ) originally , most medical sources defined fetishism as a sexual interest in non-living objects , body parts or secretions in 1987 , a revised edition of the dsm-iii ( dsm-iii-r ) introduced a new diagnosis for body part arousal , called partialism martin kafka argued that partialism should be merged into fetishism because of overlap between the two conditions , and the dsm-5 subsequently did so in 2013 of the groups about body parts or features , 47 % belonged to groups about feet ( podophilia ) , 9 % about body fluids ( including urophilia , scatophilia , lactaphilia , menophilia , mucophilia ) , 9 % about body size , 7 % about hair ( hair fetish ) , and 5 % about muscles ( muscle worship ) less popular groups focused on navels ( navel fetishism ) , legs , body hair , mouth , and nails , among other things of the groups about clothing , 33 % belonged to groups about clothes worn on the legs or buttocks ( such as stockings or skirts ) , 32 % about footwear ( shoe fetishism ) , 12 % about underwear ( underwear fetishism ) , and 9 % about whole-body wear such as jackets less popular object groups focused on headwear , stethoscopes , wristwear , pacifiers , and diapers ( diaper fetishism ) devotism is only a sexual fetish when the person who has the fetish considers the amputated body part on another person the object of sexual interest according to john bancroft , conditioning alone can not explain fetishism , because it does not result in fetishism for most people fetishism could result when a child is imprinted with an overly narrow or incorrect concept of a sex object it is only considered a disorder when fetishistic activities are the foremost source of sexual satisfaction , and become so compelling or unacceptable as to cause distress or interfere with normal sexual intercourse under the dsm-5 , fetishism is sexual arousal from nonliving objects or specific nongenital body parts , excluding clothes used for cross-dressing ( as that falls under transvestic disorder ) and sex toys that are designed for genital stimulation in order to be diagnosed as fetishistic disorder , the arousal must persist for at least six months and cause significant psychosocial distress or impairment in important areas of their life according to the world health organization , fetishistic fantasies are common and should only be treated as a disorder when they impair normal functioning or cause distress a content analysis of the sample 's favorite fantasies found that 14 % of the male fantasies involved fetishism ( including feet , nonsexual objects , and specific clothing ) , and 4.7 % focused on a specific body part other than feet a fetish is an object believed to have supernatural powers , or in particular , a man-made object that has power over others today , hirschfeld 's theory is often mentioned in the context of gender role specific behavior : females present sexual stimuli by highlighting body parts , clothes or accessories ; males react to them rats will also develop sexual preferences for the location of their early sexual experiences , and can be conditioned to show increased arousal in the presence of objects such as a plastic toy fish

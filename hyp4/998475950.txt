the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation the chirality of the product of a sharpless epoxidation is sometimes predicted with the following mnemonic the sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols the sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure the jacobsen epoxidation , an alternative method to enantioselectively oxidise alkenes , overcomes this issue and tolerates a wider array of functional groups early work showed that allylic alcohols give facial selectivity when using m-cpba as an oxidant for cyclic allylic alcohols , greater selectivity is seen when the alcohol was locked in the pseudo equatorial position rather than the pseudo axial position however , perfluoric peracids are still able to hydrogen bond with protected alcohols and give normal selectivity with the hydrogen present on the peracid while hydrogen bonding substrates give the same type of selectivity in allylic and homoallylic cases , the opposite is true of vanadium catalysts early work done by sharpless shows its preference for reacting with alkenes with allylic alcohols over more substituted electron dense alkenes sharpless asymmetric epoxidation reaction

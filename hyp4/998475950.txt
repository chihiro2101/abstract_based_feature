the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure early work showed that allylic alcohols give facial selectivity when using m-cpba as an oxidant this finding leads to the conclusion that hydrogen bonding played a key role in selectivity and the following model was proposed for cyclic allylic alcohols , greater selectivity is seen when the alcohol was locked in the pseudo equatorial position rather than the pseudo axial position however , it was found that for metal catalyzed systems such as those based on vanadium , reaction rates were accelerated when the hydroxyl group was in the axial position by a factor of 34 however , perfluoric peracids are still able to hydrogen bond with protected alcohols and give normal selectivity with the hydrogen present on the peracid however , the reaction rates of substrates with a hydrogen bonding group are still faster than the equivalent protected substrates allyl alcohols are effective directing groups for epoxidations in both cyclic and acyclic systems for substrates which show hydrogen bonding while hydrogen bonding substrates give the same type of selectivity in allylic and homoallylic cases , the opposite is true of vanadium catalysts although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations , vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols although vanadium is generally less reactive than other metal complexes , in the presence of allylic alcohols , the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum , the most reactive metal for epoxidations

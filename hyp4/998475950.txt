the chirality of the product of a sharpless epoxidation is sometimes predicted with the following mnemonic the sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols the sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols furthermore , with the exception noted above , a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure background on epoxidation of allylic alcohols early work showed that allylic alcohols give facial selectivity when using m-cpba as an oxidant for cyclic allylic alcohols , greater selectivity is seen when the alcohol was locked in the pseudo equatorial position rather than the pseudo axial position although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity , the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols however , vanadium complexes do not hydrogen bond with their substrates although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations , vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols sharpless asymmetric epoxidation reaction

regardless , all studies have concluded that the catalyst is a dimer of ti ( tartrate ) ( or ) 2 the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation the chirality of the product of a sharpless epoxidation is sometimes predicted with the following mnemonic in this orientation , the ( âˆ’ ) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the top half of the molecule , and the ( + ) diester tartrate preferentially interacts with the bottom half of the molecule the sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols the sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure the sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides , terpenes , leukotrienes , pheromones , and antibiotics early work showed that allylic alcohols give facial selectivity when using m-cpba as an oxidant although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity , the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations , vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols sharpless asymmetric epoxidation reaction

the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation a rectangle is drawn around the double bond in the same plane as the carbons of the double bond ( the xy-plane ) , with the allylic alcohol in the bottom right corner and the other substituents in their appropriate corners the sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols the sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols furthermore , with the exception noted above , a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene the sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides , terpenes , leukotrienes , pheromones , and antibiotics the jacobsen epoxidation , an alternative method to enantioselectively oxidise alkenes , overcomes this issue and tolerates a wider array of functional groups for cyclic allylic alcohols , greater selectivity is seen when the alcohol was locked in the pseudo equatorial position rather than the pseudo axial position however , it was found that for metal catalyzed systems such as those based on vanadium , reaction rates were accelerated when the hydroxyl group was in the axial position by a factor of 34 allyl alcohols are effective directing groups for epoxidations in both cyclic and acyclic systems for substrates which show hydrogen bonding although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations , vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols sharpless asymmetric epoxidation reaction

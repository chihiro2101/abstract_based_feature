the putative catalyst was determined using x-ray structural determinations of model complexes which have the necessary structural components to catalyze the sharpless epoxidation the chirality of the product of a sharpless epoxidation is sometimes predicted with the following mnemonic the sharpless epoxidation can also give kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of secondary 2,3-epoxyalcohols the sharpless epoxidation is viable with a large range of primary and secondary alkenic alcohols furthermore , with the exception noted above , a given dialkyl tartrate will preferentially add to the same face independent of the substitution on the alkene to demonstrate the synthetic utility of the sharpless epoxidation , the sharpless group created synthetic intermediates of various natural products : methymycin , erythromycin , leukotriene c-1 , and ( + ) -disparlure the sharpless epoxidation has been used for the total synthesis of various saccharides , terpenes , leukotrienes , pheromones , and antibiotics this finding leads to the conclusion that hydrogen bonding played a key role in selectivity and the following model was proposed although the presence of an allylic alcohol does lead to increased stereoselectivity , the rates of these reactions are slower than systems lacking alcohols allyl alcohols are effective directing groups for epoxidations in both cyclic and acyclic systems for substrates which show hydrogen bonding although it is the least reactive metal catalyst for epoxidations , vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols sharpless asymmetric epoxidation reaction

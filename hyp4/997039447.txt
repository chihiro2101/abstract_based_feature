early cold-cathode devices included the geissler tube and plucker tube , and early cathode ray tubes neon lamps are used both to produce light as indicators and for special-purpose illumination , and also as circuit elements displaying negative resistance addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit ; bell laboratories developed a '' trigger tube '' cold-cathode device in 1936 many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed , including various types of thyratron , the krytron , cold-cathode displays ( nixie tube ) and others voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments a dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) and neon lamps both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with alternating current a cold cathode is distinguished from a hot cathode that is heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons examples are most common fluorescent lamps , high-pressure discharge lamps and vacuum fluorescent displays the discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode , enough positive ions hit the cathode to free , on average , another electron cold cathodes are used in cold-cathode rectifiers , such as the crossatron and mercury-arc valves , and cold-cathode amplifiers , such as in automatic message accounting and other pseudospark switching applications ( instant-start fluorescent lamps employ this aspect ; they start as cold-cathode devices , but soon localized heating of the fine tungsten-wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as hot-cathode lamps

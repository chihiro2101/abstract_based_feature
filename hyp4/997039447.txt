early cold-cathode devices included the geissler tube and plucker tube , and early cathode ray tubes addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit ; bell laboratories developed a '' trigger tube '' cold-cathode device in 1936 neale , cold cathode tube circuit design , francis and taylor , 1964 many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed , including various types of thyratron , the krytron , cold-cathode displays ( nixie tube ) and others voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) and neon lamps in the lighting industry , “ cold cathode ” historically refers to luminous tubing larger than 20 & nbsp ; mm in diameter and operating on a current of 120 to 240 milliamperes both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with alternating current a cold cathode is distinguished from a hot cathode that is heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons examples are most common fluorescent lamps , high-pressure discharge lamps and vacuum fluorescent displays the discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode , enough positive ions hit the cathode to free , on average , another electron another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is field electron emission the electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode

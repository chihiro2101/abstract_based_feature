early cold-cathode devices included the geissler tube and plucker tube , and early cathode ray tubes neale , cold cathode tube circuit design , francis and taylor , 1964 many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed , including various types of thyratron , the krytron , cold-cathode displays ( nixie tube ) and others voltage regulator tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a glow discharge over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments cold-cathode lamps include cold-cathode fluorescent lamps ( ccfls ) and neon lamps in the lighting industry , “ cold cathode ” historically refers to luminous tubing larger than 20 & nbsp ; mm in diameter and operating on a current of 120 to 240 milliamperes the cathode is the negative electrode both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with alternating current a cold cathode is distinguished from a hot cathode that is heated to induce thermionic emission of electrons the result is for each electron that leaves the cathode , several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode the resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is field electron emission the electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode

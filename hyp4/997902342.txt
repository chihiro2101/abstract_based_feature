the mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the german amateur artist ludwig von siegen ( 1609â€“ godfrey kneller worked closely with john smith , who is said to have lived in his house for a period ; he created about 500 mezzotints , some 300 copies of portrait paintings image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg thumb left early mezzotint by wallerant vaillant , siegen 's assistant or tutor the first mezzotints by ludwig von siegen were made using the light to dark method the metal plate was tooled to create indentations and parts of the image that were to stay light in tone were kept smooth this technique meant that is was possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively , where the darker parts of the image are to be the whole surface ( usually ) of a metal , usually copper , plate is roughened evenly , manually with a rocker , or mechanically the image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools ; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool jacob christoph le blon used the dark to light method and invented the three and four-color mezzotint printing technique by using a separate metal plate for each color le blon 's color printing method applied the ryb color model approach whereby red , yellow and blue were used to create a larger gamut of color nuances because the pits in the plate are not deep , only a small number of top-quality impressions ( copies ) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out

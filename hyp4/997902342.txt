the mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the german amateur artist ludwig von siegen ( 1609â€“ the rocker seems to have been invented by prince rupert of the rhine , a famous cavalry commander in the english civil war , who was the next to use the process , and took it to england godfrey kneller worked closely with john smith , who is said to have lived in his house for a period ; he created about 500 mezzotints , some 300 copies of portrait paintings the first mezzotints by ludwig von siegen were made using the light to dark method the metal plate was tooled to create indentations and parts of the image that were to stay light in tone were kept smooth this technique meant that is was possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively , where the darker parts of the image are to be jacob christoph le blon used the dark to light method and invented the three and four-color mezzotint printing technique by using a separate metal plate for each color printing the finished plate is the same for either method , and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate ; the whole surface is inked , the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate because the pits in the plate are not deep , only a small number of top-quality impressions ( copies ) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out plates can be mechanically roughened ; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass ; the finer the filings , the smaller the grain of the surface mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones : first , because an evenly , finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink , allowing deep solid colors to be printed ; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with burin , burnisher and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed

six years later , in december 1979 , the arrival of a capable european expendable launch system was marked when the first ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the guiana space centre at kourou , french guiana however , even prior to the launcher having entering service , there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads than ariane 1 could these desires would result in the creation of both the ariane 2 and ariane 3 the ariane 3 was designed to satisfy the future demand for the delivery of two tonne payloads into a geosynchronous transfer orbit ( gto ) the principal agency behind the development of the ariane 3 was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) , while the lead company for its production was the french aerospace manufacturer aérospatiale in order to keep costs down , cnes directed that only tested technologies could be implemented in the launcher 's improvements ; in fact , no budget was provided for new test series to be performed the ariane 3 's design heavily influenced that of its successor , the ariane 4 ; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher , one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the ariane 3 the esa opted for a calculated risk on the first launch , saving €60 million , by performing a commercial launch with the very first flight of the ariane 3 at the time of the ariane 3 's maiden flight , the united states still held a majority of the global launcher market ; by the end of the year , the order books were shifting in favour of the ariane family , having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of €1 billion despite its relative success , the ariane 3 was quickly replaced by the even more capable ariane 4 , resulting in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches

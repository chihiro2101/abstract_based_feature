six years later , in december 1979 , the arrival of a capable european expendable launch system was marked when the first ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the guiana space centre at kourou , french guiana however , even prior to the launcher having entering service , there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads than ariane 1 could these desires would result in the creation of both the ariane 2 and ariane 3 while the initiative was first proposed in 1978 , prior to the ariane 1 's first flight , approval to commence the first phase of development was not received until july 1979 according to aerospace historian brian harvey , in spite of the numbering sequence adopted , the ariane 3 was the direct successor to the ariane 1 , rather than the ariane 2 , as could be logically assumed the principal agency behind the development of the ariane 3 was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) , while the lead company for its production was the french aerospace manufacturer aérospatiale the finalised ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier ariane 1 , but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the ariane 2 the ariane 3 made its maiden flight on 4 august 1984 , almost two years before the ariane 2 's first launch , placing the ecs-2 and télécom 1a satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit at the time of the ariane 3 's maiden flight , the united states still held a majority of the global launcher market ; by the end of the year , the order books were shifting in favour of the ariane family , having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of €1 billion despite its relative success , the ariane 3 was quickly replaced by the even more capable ariane 4 , resulting in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches

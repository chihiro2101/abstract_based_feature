six years later , in december 1979 , the arrival of a capable european expendable launch system was marked when the first ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the guiana space centre at kourou , french guiana the ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the soviet union and the united states these desires would result in the creation of both the ariane 2 and ariane 3 the ariane 3 was designed to satisfy the future demand for the delivery of two tonne payloads into a geosynchronous transfer orbit ( gto ) according to aerospace historian brian harvey , in spite of the numbering sequence adopted , the ariane 3 was the direct successor to the ariane 1 , rather than the ariane 2 , as could be logically assumed the principal agency behind the development of the ariane 3 was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) , while the lead company for its production was the french aerospace manufacturer aérospatiale furthermore , it was restricted to using the existing launch pad and handling facilities established for the ariane 1 , and that there was to be no allowance for retooling of the ariane production line the finalised ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier ariane 1 , but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the ariane 2 at the time of the ariane 3 's maiden flight , the united states still held a majority of the global launcher market ; by the end of the year , the order books were shifting in favour of the ariane family , having outstanding orders to launch 30 satellites at a cumulative cost of €1 billion despite its relative success , the ariane 3 was quickly replaced by the even more capable ariane 4 , resulting in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches

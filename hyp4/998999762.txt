the ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the soviet union and the united states however , even prior to the launcher having entering service , there was a strong desire to quickly produce improved derivatives that would be able to handle even greater payloads than ariane 1 could these desires would result in the creation of both the ariane 2 and ariane 3 while the initiative was first proposed in 1978 , prior to the ariane 1 's first flight , approval to commence the first phase of development was not received until july 1979 according to aerospace historian brian harvey , in spite of the numbering sequence adopted , the ariane 3 was the direct successor to the ariane 1 , rather than the ariane 2 , as could be logically assumed furthermore , it was restricted to using the existing launch pad and handling facilities established for the ariane 1 , and that there was to be no allowance for retooling of the ariane production line the finalised ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier ariane 1 , but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the ariane 2 the ariane 3 's design heavily influenced that of its successor , the ariane 4 ; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher , one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the ariane 3 the esa opted for a calculated risk on the first launch , saving â‚¬60 million , by performing a commercial launch with the very first flight of the ariane 3 according to harvey , the ariane family had become the dominant series of launchers on the world market as early as 1986

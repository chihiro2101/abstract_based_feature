six years later , in december 1979 , the arrival of a capable european expendable launch system was marked when the first ariane 1 launcher was successfully launched from the guiana space centre at kourou , french guiana the ariane 1 soon became considered to be a capable and competitive launcher in comparison to rival platforms offered by the soviet union and the united states according to aerospace historian brian harvey , in spite of the numbering sequence adopted , the ariane 3 was the direct successor to the ariane 1 , rather than the ariane 2 , as could be logically assumed the principal agency behind the development of the ariane 3 was the centre national d'etudes spatiales ( cnes ) , while the lead company for its production was the french aerospace manufacturer a√©rospatiale furthermore , it was restricted to using the existing launch pad and handling facilities established for the ariane 1 , and that there was to be no allowance for retooling of the ariane production line the finalised ariane 3 followed the same basic design as the earlier ariane 1 , but incorporated numerous modifications that had been made for the ariane 2 unlike the ariane 2 , two solid-fuelled pap strap-on booster rockets were used to augment the first stage at liftoff the core of the ariane 3 was essentially identical to that of the ariane 2 the ariane 3 's design heavily influenced that of its successor , the ariane 4 ; while the design team considered various approaches for achieving such a launcher , one of the studied concepts had involved the addition of a fifth engine to an enlarged first stage of the ariane 3 despite its relative success , the ariane 3 was quickly replaced by the even more capable ariane 4 , resulting in the launcher only conducting a comparatively small number of launches

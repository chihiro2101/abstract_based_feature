fixed costs , which occur only in the short run , are incurred by the business at any level of output , including zero output fixed cost and variable cost , combined , equal total cost entrepreneur.com marginal cost and marginal revenue , depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not , are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced , or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output right to obtain the profit maximizing output quantity , we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue ( tr ) minus total cost ( tc ) the profit-maximizing output level is represented as the one at which total revenue is the height of c and total cost is the height of b ; the maximal profit is measured as the length of the segment cb this optimal quantity of output is the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost right an equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that , for each unit sold , marginal profit ( mπ ) equals marginal revenue ( mr ) minus marginal cost ( mc ) then , if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output , marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced , and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost , marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced at the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost , marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit the marginal revenue from an incremental unit of output has two parts : first , the revenue the firm gains from selling the additional units or , giving the term p∆q the general rule is that the firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost to maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input '' up to the point where the input 's marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs ''

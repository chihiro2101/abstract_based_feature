fixed costs , which occur only in the short run , are incurred by the business at any level of output , including zero output fixed cost and variable cost , combined , equal total cost right to obtain the profit maximizing output quantity , we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue ( tr ) minus total cost ( tc ) in the accompanying diagram , the linear total revenue curve represents the case in which the firm is a perfect competitor in the goods market , and thus can not set its own selling price this output level is also the one at which the total profit curve is at its maximum this optimal quantity of output is the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost marginal revenue–marginal cost perspective right an equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that , for each unit sold , marginal profit ( mπ ) equals marginal revenue ( mr ) minus marginal cost ( mc ) at the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost , marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit the marginal revenue from an incremental unit of output has two parts : first , the revenue the firm gains from selling the additional units or , giving the term p∆q the general rule is that the firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost to maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input '' up to the point where the input 's marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs ''

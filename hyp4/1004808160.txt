fixed costs , which occur only in the short run , are incurred by the business at any level of output , including zero output fixed cost and variable cost , combined , equal total cost profits can be increased by up to 1000 percent , this is important for sole traders and small businesses let alone big businesses but none the less all profit maximization is a matter of each business stage and greater returns for profit sharing thus higher wages and motivation entrepreneur.com marginal cost and marginal revenue , depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not , are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced , or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output for instance , taking the first definition , if it costs a firm 400 to produce 5 units and 480 to produce 6 , the marginal cost of the sixth unit is 80 dollars this optimal quantity of output is the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost right an equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that , for each unit sold , marginal profit ( mπ ) equals marginal revenue ( mr ) minus marginal cost ( mc ) then , if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output , marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced , and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost , marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced at the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost , marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit since total profit increases when marginal profit is positive and total profit decreases when marginal profit is negative , it must reach a maximum where marginal profit is zero—where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—and where lower or higher output levels give lower profit levels the general rule is that the firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost to maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input '' up to the point where the input 's marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs ''

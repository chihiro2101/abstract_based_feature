fixed costs , which occur only in the short run , are incurred by the business at any level of output , including zero output entrepreneur.com marginal cost and marginal revenue , depending on whether the calculus approach is taken or not , are defined as either the change in cost or revenue as each additional unit is produced , or the derivative of cost or revenue with respect to the quantity of output for instance , taking the first definition , if it costs a firm 400 to produce 5 units and 480 to produce 6 , the marginal cost of the sixth unit is 80 dollars right to obtain the profit maximizing output quantity , we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue ( tr ) minus total cost ( tc ) this output level is also the one at which the total profit curve is at its maximum if , contrary to what is assumed in the graph , the firm is not a perfect competitor in the output market , the price to sell the product at can be read off the demand curve at the firm 's optimal mechanism this optimal quantity of output is the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost right an equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that , for each unit sold , marginal profit ( mÏ€ ) equals marginal revenue ( mr ) minus marginal cost ( mc ) at the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost , marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit in calculus terms , the requirement that the optimal output have higher profit than adjacent output levels is that : : \frac , where and refer to the midpoints between the old and new values of price and quantity respectively the profit maximization issue can also be approached from the input side to maximize profit the firm should increase usage of the input '' up to the point where the input 's marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs ''

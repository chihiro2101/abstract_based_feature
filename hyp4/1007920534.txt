baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts when combined with water , the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide whether commercially or domestically prepared , the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same alternately , a commercial baking powder might use sodium acid pyrophosphate as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate another typical acid in such formulations is cream of tartar ( kcarbonhydrogenoxygen ) , a derivative of tartaric acid '' the acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting a fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated by providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical this is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today for example , rumford baking powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate ( also called calcium acid phosphate ) high-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminium phosphate , and sodium acid pyrophosphate when amelia simmons published american cookery ( 1792 ) , the first american cookbook , the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening : baker 's yeast , emptins ( from the leavings of brewer 's yeast ) , and pearlash if lucky , they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive , regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination making cakes was even more laborious than making bread : to prepare a cake , a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour combining it with an acidic ingredient like sour milk or lemon juice resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide cream of tartar , also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate , was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from france and italy in 1846 , the first edition of catherine beecher 's cookbook domestic recipe book ( 1846 ) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar there were recipes for a '' crust '' similar to modern dumplings or cobbler , several for cakes , and one for '' soda doughnuts '' the chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid ( s ) and an acid such as sour milk , vinegar , lemon juice , or cream of tartar because these acidulants react with baking soda quickly , retention of gas bubbles was dependent on batter viscosity a single-action form of baking powder , alfred bird 's baking powder reacted as soon as it became damp in 1864 , he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or '' bread preparation '' in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener baking powders based on horsford 's formula were sold in england as '' horsford-liebig baking powder '' as described above , baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid

baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts when combined with water , the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide whether commercially or domestically prepared , the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same a typical formulation ( by weight ) could call for 30 % sodium bicarbonate , 5–12 % monocalcium phosphate , and 21–26 % sodium aluminium sulfate alternately , a commercial baking powder might use sodium acid pyrophosphate as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate another typical acid in such formulations is cream of tartar ( kcarbonhydrogenoxygen ) , a derivative of tartaric acid in some jurisdictions , it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of carbon dioxide . single- and double-acting baking powders '' the acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting when the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids , they are known as '' double-acting '' ; those that contain only one acid are '' single-acting '' this is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today for example , rumford baking powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid further release of gas requires the batter to be heated above 140 & nbsp ; °f ( 60 & nbsp ; °c ) common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate ( also called calcium acid phosphate ) high-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminium phosphate , and sodium acid pyrophosphate pound cakes combined butter , sugar , and flour and eggs , and were particularly dense the third type of leavening , pearlash , was the precursor to modern baking powder it was first used as a leavening agent by native americans and was the subject of the first patent in the united states , issued in april 1790 the creation of shelf-stable chemical combinations of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar is seen as marking the true introduction of baking powder the first to create a form of baking powder was english chemist and food manufacturer alfred bird in 1843 a single-action form of baking powder , alfred bird 's baking powder reacted as soon as it became damp horsford 's leavening products were marketed originally as '' horsford 's yeast powder '' and later as '' rumford baking powder '' baking powders based on horsford 's formula were sold in england as '' horsford-liebig baking powder '' when excessive acid is present , some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda as described above , baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid

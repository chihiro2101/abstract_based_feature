baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts when combined with water , the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide whether commercially or domestically prepared , the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same alternately , a commercial baking powder might use sodium acid pyrophosphate as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate in some jurisdictions , it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of carbon dioxide '' the acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting a fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated when the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids , they are known as '' double-acting '' ; those that contain only one acid are '' single-acting '' by providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical this is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today for example , rumford baking powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid with this acid , about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate ( also called calcium acid phosphate ) primarily it is used to absorb moisture , and thus prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder 's alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely a dry powder also flows and mixes more easily yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients , like sugar , spices , fruits or nuts the third type of leavening , pearlash , was the precursor to modern baking powder the term '' saleratus '' was applied confusingly to both potassium bicarbonate and to sodium bicarbonate ( nabicarbonate , what we now call baking soda ) several recipes in the compilation cookbook practical american cookery ( 1855 ) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough the chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid ( s ) and an acid such as sour milk , vinegar , lemon juice , or cream of tartar in america , eben norton horsford , a student of justus von liebig , set out to create a flour fortifier and leavening agent ( davis baking powder is commonly found in the northeastern united states when excessive acid is present , some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda moisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time , and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container as described above , baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid

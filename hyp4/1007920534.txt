baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts when combined with water , the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide a typical formulation ( by weight ) could call for 30 % sodium bicarbonate , 5–12 % monocalcium phosphate , and 21–26 % sodium aluminium sulfate alternately , a commercial baking powder might use sodium acid pyrophosphate as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate another typical acid in such formulations is cream of tartar ( kcarbonhydrogenoxygen ) , a derivative of tartaric acid in some jurisdictions , it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of carbon dioxide '' the acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting a fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated when the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids , they are known as '' double-acting '' ; those that contain only one acid are '' single-acting '' for example , rumford baking powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate ( also called calcium acid phosphate ) high-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminium phosphate , and sodium acid pyrophosphate baking powders also include components to improve their stability and consistency a dry powder also flows and mixes more easily combining it with an acidic ingredient like sour milk or lemon juice resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide small amounts could be used on a daily basis , rather than baking a week or two weeks ' worth of bread at one time the term '' saleratus '' was applied confusingly to both potassium bicarbonate and to sodium bicarbonate ( nabicarbonate , what we now call baking soda ) in 1846 , the first edition of catherine beecher 's cookbook domestic recipe book ( 1846 ) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar baking soda and cream of tartar were sold by chemists rather than in grocery stores the chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid ( s ) and an acid such as sour milk , vinegar , lemon juice , or cream of tartar although cooks had used both sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar in recipes , they had to purchase the ingredients individually and store them separately to prevent them from spoiling or reacting prematurely horsford 's leavening products were marketed originally as '' horsford 's yeast powder '' and later as '' rumford baking powder '' baking powders based on horsford 's formula were sold in england as '' horsford-liebig baking powder '' as described above , baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt , baking soda can be used without cream of tartar ( or with less )

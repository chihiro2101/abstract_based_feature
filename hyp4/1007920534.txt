baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts when combined with water , the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide whether commercially or domestically prepared , the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same alternately , a commercial baking powder might use sodium acid pyrophosphate as one of the two acidic components instead of sodium aluminium sulfate in some jurisdictions , it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of carbon dioxide '' the acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting a fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated when the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids , they are known as '' double-acting '' ; those that contain only one acid are '' single-acting '' by providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical this is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today double-acting baking powders work in two phases ; once when cold , and once when hot common low-temperature acid salts include cream of tartar and monocalcium phosphate ( also called calcium acid phosphate ) john brodie , john godber '' bakery processes , chemical leavening agents '' in kirk-othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology 2001 , john wiley & sons an inert starch serves several functions in baking powder primarily it is used to absorb moisture , and thus prolong shelf life of the compound by keeping the powder 's alkaline and acidic components dry so as not to react with each other prematurely it was first used as a leavening agent by native americans and was the subject of the first patent in the united states , issued in april 1790 small amounts could be used on a daily basis , rather than baking a week or two weeks ' worth of bread at one time several recipes in the compilation cookbook practical american cookery ( 1855 ) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough there were recipes for a '' crust '' similar to modern dumplings or cobbler , several for cakes , and one for '' soda doughnuts '' the chemical leavening effects were accomplished by the activating of a base such as baking soda in the presence of liquid ( s ) and an acid such as sour milk , vinegar , lemon juice , or cream of tartar because these acidulants react with baking soda quickly , retention of gas bubbles was dependent on batter viscosity a single-action form of baking powder , alfred bird 's baking powder reacted as soon as it became damp when excessive acid is present , some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda as described above , baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt , baking soda can be used without cream of tartar ( or with less )

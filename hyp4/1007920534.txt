baking powder is made up of a base , an acid , and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use most commercially available baking powders are made up of sodium bicarbonate ( nahco 3 , also known as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda ) and one or more acid salts when combined with water , the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous carbon dioxide whether commercially or domestically prepared , the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same another typical acid in such formulations is cream of tartar ( kcarbonhydrogenoxygen ) , a derivative of tartaric acid in some jurisdictions , it is required that baking soda must produce at least 10 per cent of its weight of carbon dioxide '' the acid in a baking powder can be either fast-acting or slow-acting a fast-acting acid reacts in a wet mixture with baking soda at room temperature , and a slow-acting acid does not react until heated when the chemical reactions in baking powders involve both fast- and slow-acting acids , they are known as '' double-acting '' ; those that contain only one acid are '' single-acting '' by providing a second rise in the oven , double-acting baking powders increase the reliability of baked goods by rendering the time elapsed between mixing and baking less critical this is the type of baking powder most widely available to consumers today for example , rumford baking powder is a double-acting product that contains only monocalcium phosphate as a leavening acid with this acid , about two-thirds of the available gas is released within about two minutes of mixing at room temperature high-temperature acid salts include sodium aluminium sulfate , sodium aluminium phosphate , and sodium acid pyrophosphate an inert starch serves several functions in baking powder a dry powder also flows and mixes more easily sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening the third type of leavening , pearlash , was the precursor to modern baking powder it was first used as a leavening agent by native americans and was the subject of the first patent in the united states , issued in april 1790 combining it with an acidic ingredient like sour milk or lemon juice resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide small amounts could be used on a daily basis , rather than baking a week or two weeks ' worth of bread at one time in 1846 , the first edition of catherine beecher 's cookbook domestic recipe book ( 1846 ) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar the first to create a form of baking powder was english chemist and food manufacturer alfred bird in 1843 baking powders based on horsford 's formula were sold in england as '' horsford-liebig baking powder '' when excessive acid is present , some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda as described above , baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid

before the bridge , commuters crossed the humber on the humber ferry from corporation pier at hull and new holland pier at new holland , lincolnshire or by road via the m62 ( from 1976 ) , m18 ( from 1979 ) and m180 motorways , crossing the river ouse near goole ( connected to the humber ) until the mid-1970s , the route south was via the single-carriageway a63 and the a614 ( via grid-locked thorne where it met the busy a18 and crossed the stainforth and keadby canal at a swing bridge bottleneck and on through finningley and bawtry , meeting the east–west a631 ) it was not unexpected that under these conditions , a humber bridge , with connecting dual-carriageway approach roads and grade-separated junctions , would seem worthwhile by the time the bridge opened , much of this inferior route had been transformed by dualling of the a63 and its bypasses , extending the m62 and the connecting of the m18 from thorne to wadworth the obvious need for a humber bridge had been reduced by the late 1970s with the improvements of the motorway infrastructure in the region although welcome , these improvements detracted from the need for vehicles to cross a bridge from hessle to barton the humber bridge was a victim of the success of the m62 before it opened plans for a bridge were drawn up in the 1930s and revised in 1955 but work did not begin until 27 july 1972 the humber bridge act , promoted by kingston upon hull corporation , was passed in 1959 this established the humber bridge board to manage and raise funds to build the bridge and buy the land required for the approach roads to save his government , labour prime minister harold wilson prevailed upon his minister of transport barbara castle to sanction the building of the bridge dismay at the long wait for a crossing led to christopher rowe writing a protest song , '' the humber bridge '' sir ralph freeman had produced the first ideas in 1927 and in the early 1930s the cost of the project was estimated at £1.725 & nbsp ; million and that the bridge would be unlikely to recoup the construction or maintenance costs in 1935 he had an idea for a suspension bridge for the humber tunnel executive committee once it was likely that a bridge would be constructed , imperial college-educated bernard wex obe ( 24 april 1922 – 31 july 1990 ) produced the design in 1964 that was actually built work on the bridge substructure ( foundations ) began in march 1973 with a centre span of and a total length of , the humber bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world for 17 years , until the akashi kaikyō bridge opened in japan on 5 april 1998 the road-distance between hull and grimsby fell by nearly ; the town of scunthorpe and environs were relieved of the passing traffic between the two the bridge 's surface takes the form of a dual carriageway with a lower-level foot and cyclepath on both sides the bridge is designed to tolerate constant motion and bends more than in winds of the bridge was relegated to third place with the opening of the akashi kaikyō bridge in april 1998 the existing humber bridge toll system was largely the same as it was when the bridge opened in 1981 the bridge had a toll bridge of £1.50 for cars from 1 april 2012 , until for six months it was £3.00 and the only trunk road british toll bridge to charge motorcycles ( £1.20 ) the government responded to the petition on 14 january 2008 , stating that '' concessions or exemptions from tolls on the humber bridge are a matter for the humber bridge board '' the toll was raised on 1 october 2011 , at which point it became the most expensive in the united kingdom

before the bridge , commuters crossed the humber on the humber ferry from corporation pier at hull and new holland pier at new holland , lincolnshire or by road via the m62 ( from 1976 ) , m18 ( from 1979 ) and m180 motorways , crossing the river ouse near goole ( connected to the humber ) it was not unexpected that under these conditions , a humber bridge , with connecting dual-carriageway approach roads and grade-separated junctions , would seem worthwhile by the time the bridge opened , much of this inferior route had been transformed by dualling of the a63 and its bypasses , extending the m62 and the connecting of the m18 from thorne to wadworth the obvious need for a humber bridge had been reduced by the late 1970s with the improvements of the motorway infrastructure in the region the humber bridge was a victim of the success of the m62 before it opened plans for a bridge were drawn up in the 1930s and revised in 1955 but work did not begin until 27 july 1972 the humber bridge act , promoted by kingston upon hull corporation , was passed in 1959 this established the humber bridge board to manage and raise funds to build the bridge and buy the land required for the approach roads raising funds proved impossible until the 1966 kingston upon hull north by-election to save his government , labour prime minister harold wilson prevailed upon his minister of transport barbara castle to sanction the building of the bridge sir ralph freeman had produced the first ideas in 1927 and in the early 1930s the cost of the project was estimated at £1.725 & nbsp ; million and that the bridge would be unlikely to recoup the construction or maintenance costs in 1935 he had an idea for a suspension bridge for the humber tunnel executive committee once it was likely that a bridge would be constructed , imperial college-educated bernard wex obe ( 24 april 1922 – 31 july 1990 ) produced the design in 1964 that was actually built , then a unit of nei cranes ltd , the cleveland bridge & engineering and redpath dorman long ltd ) it included a span from the southern anchorage of seven pre-stressed concrete box sections and the a1077 junction , costing £4.25 & nbsp ; million it took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a slurry wall design due to not enough shallow bedrock the main southern approach roads from barton to the m180 motorway junction at barnetby were built in the late 1970s by clugston construction of scunthorpe , opening in 1978 the northern tower and anchorage was built on solid chalk but the southern tower and anchorage were built on fissured kimmeridge clay , from the southern shore and built with a difficult caisson design with a centre span of and a total length of , the humber bridge was the longest single-span suspension bridge in the world for 17 years , until the akashi kaikyō bridge opened in japan on 5 april 1998 cycling the bridge the bridge is crossed twice during the annual humber bridge in june half marathon and hull marathon in september the existing humber bridge toll system was largely the same as it was when the bridge opened in 1981 plans were announced on 26 december 2009 to construct a suicide barrier along the walkways of the bridge ; design constraints were cited as the reason for not installing barriers during the construction of the bridge the bridge had a toll bridge of £1.50 for cars from 1 april 2012 , until for six months it was £3.00 and the only trunk road british toll bridge to charge motorcycles ( £1.20 ) in 1996 , parliament passed the humber bridge ( debts ) act 1996 to reorganise the board 's liabilities to ensure the bridge could be safely maintained humber bridge board humber rescue , based underneath the bridge

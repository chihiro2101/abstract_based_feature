'' waking sleep '' he asserted that people in their typical state function as unconscious automatons , but that a person can '' wake up '' and become a different sort of human being altogether gurdjieff and his school some contemporary researchers claim gurdjieff 's concept of 'self-remembering is close to the buddhist concept of awareness or a popular definition of “ mindfulness ” sergei kukharenko , '' hindu and buddhist views proliferation influence on gurdjieff 's teaching '' gurdjieff argued that many of the existing forms of religious and spiritual tradition on earth had lost connection with their original meaning and vitality and so could no longer serve humanity in the way that had been intended at their inception according to gurdjieff , only one dimension of the three dimensions of the person—namely , either the emotions , or the physical body or the mind—tends to develop in such schools and sects , and generally at the expense of the other faculties or centers , as gurdjieff called them as a result , these paths fail to produce a properly balanced human being instead of developing body , mind , or emotions separately , gurdjieff 's discipline worked on all three to promote comprehensive and balanced inner development ouspensky from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of gurdjieff 's ideas after ouspensky 's death , his students published a book titled the fourth way based on his lectures gurdjieff 's teaching addressed the question of humanity 's place in the universe and the importance of developing latent potentialities—regarded as our natural endowment as human beings but rarely brought to fruition in search of the miraculous chapter 2 inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve the fourth way , chapter 1 in his teaching gurdjieff gave a distinct meaning to various ancient texts such as the bible and many religious prayers in search of the miraculous , chapter 9 distrusting '' morality '' , which he describes as varying from culture to culture , often contradictory and hypocritical , gurdjieff greatly stressed the importance of '' conscience '' to provide conditions in which inner attention could be exercised more intensively , gurdjieff also taught his pupils '' sacred dances '' or '' movements '' , later known as the gurdjieff movements , which they performed together as a group other shocks to help awaken his pupils from constant daydreaming were always possible at any moment gurdjieff used a number of methods and materials , including meetings , music , movements ( sacred dance ) , writings , lectures , and innovative forms of group and individual work he sometimes called these methods the way of the sly man see in search of the miraculous because they constituted a sort of short-cut through a process of development that might otherwise carry on for years without substantive results gurdjieff 's music divides into three distinct periods the '' first period '' is the early music , including music from the ballet struggle of the magicians and music for early movements dating to the years around 1918 the '' second period '' music , for which gurdjieff arguably became best known , written in collaboration with russian composer thomas de hartmann , is described as the gurdjieff-de hartmann music this music was often first heard in the salon at the prieuré , where much was composed the '' last musical period '' is the improvised harmonium music which often followed the dinners gurdjieff held at his paris apartment during the occupation and immediate post-war years to his death in 1949 in all , gurdjieff in collaboration with de hartmann composed some 200 pieces sicroff

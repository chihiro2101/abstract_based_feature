the onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood , but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream this is characterized by the patient 's better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes this is attributed to the combination of increased blood flow and the ability of the body to find alternative sources of energy , like fatty acids and proteins two autosomal recessive forms of this disease occur , childhood-onset and adult-onset the gene for myophosphorylase , pygm ( the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene ) , is located on chromosome 11q13 according to the most recent publications , 95 different mutations have been reported myophosphorylase is involved in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose for use in muscle the enzyme phosphorylase kinase plays a role in phosphorylating glycogen phosphorylase to activate it and another enzyme , protein phosphatase 1 , inactivates glycogen phosphorylase through dephosphorylation a muscle biopsy will note the absence of myophosphorylase in muscle fibers dna sequencing of the pygm gene ( which codes for the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase ) may be done to determine the presence of mutation , determining if mcardle 's is present mcardle accurately concluded that the patient had a disorder of glycogen breakdown that specifically affected skeletal muscle international association for muscle glycogen storage disease ( iamgsd ) .

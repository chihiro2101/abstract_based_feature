the onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood , but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream in the long term , patients may exhibit kidney failure due to the myoglobinuria , and with age , patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss patients may present at emergency rooms with severe fixed contractures of the muscles and often severe pain two autosomal recessive forms of this disease occur , childhood-onset and adult-onset the gene for myophosphorylase , pygm ( the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene ) , is located on chromosome 11q13 lys-680 is involved in binding the pyridoxal phosphate , which is the active form of vitamin b6 , a cofactor required by myophosphorylase myophosphorylase is involved in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose for use in muscle the enzyme phosphorylase kinase plays a role in phosphorylating glycogen phosphorylase to activate it and another enzyme , protein phosphatase 1 , inactivates glycogen phosphorylase through dephosphorylation serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in mcardle disease physicians may also check resting levels of creatine kinase , which are moderately increased in 90 % of patients mcardle accurately concluded that the patient had a disorder of glycogen breakdown that specifically affected skeletal muscle international association for muscle glycogen storage disease ( iamgsd ) .

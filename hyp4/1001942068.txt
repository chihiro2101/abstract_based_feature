the onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood , but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life symptoms include exercise intolerance with myalgia , early fatigue , painful cramps , and myoglobinuria ( often provoked by a bout of exercise ) myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream this is characterized by the patient 's better tolerance for aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling after approximately 10 minutes two autosomal recessive forms of this disease occur , childhood-onset and adult-onset the gene for myophosphorylase , pygm ( the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene ) , is located on chromosome 11q13 according to the most recent publications , 95 different mutations have been reported for example , r138w is known to disrupt to pyridoxal phosphate binding site in 2006 , another mutation ( c.13_14delct ) was discovered which may contribute to increased symptoms in addition to the common arg50stop mutation the enzyme phosphorylase kinase plays a role in phosphorylating glycogen phosphorylase to activate it and another enzyme , protein phosphatase 1 , inactivates glycogen phosphorylase through dephosphorylation findings consistent with mcardle 's disease would include a failure of lactate in venous blood and exaggerated ammonia levels mcardle accurately concluded that the patient had a disorder of glycogen breakdown that specifically affected skeletal muscle international association for muscle glycogen storage disease ( iamgsd ) .

the onset of this disease is usually noticed in childhood , but often not diagnosed until the third or fourth decade of life symptoms include exercise intolerance with myalgia , early fatigue , painful cramps , and myoglobinuria ( often provoked by a bout of exercise ) myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream in the long term , patients may exhibit kidney failure due to the myoglobinuria , and with age , patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss two autosomal recessive forms of this disease occur , childhood-onset and adult-onset the gene for myophosphorylase , pygm ( the muscle-type of the glycogen phosphorylase gene ) , is located on chromosome 11q13 for example , the r50x ( arg50stop ) mutation ( previously referred to as r49x ) is most common in north america and western europe , and the y84x mutation is most common among central europeans cells form glucose-1-phosphate instead of glucose during glycogen breakdown because the polar , phosphorylated glucose can not leave the cell membrane and so is marked for intracellular catabolism findings consistent with mcardle 's disease would include a failure of lactate in venous blood and exaggerated ammonia levels serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in mcardle disease this can help distinguish mcardle 's syndrome from carnitine palmitoyltransferase ii deficiency ( cpt-ii ) , a lipid-based metabolic disorder which prevents fatty acids from being transported into mitochondria for use as an energy source genereview/nih/uw entry on glycogen storage disease type v euromac , an eu-funded consortium of medical and research institutes across europe which is building a patient registry and raising standards of care for people with mcardle disease international association for muscle glycogen storage disease ( iamgsd ) .

symptoms include exercise intolerance with myalgia , early fatigue , painful cramps , and myoglobinuria ( often provoked by a bout of exercise ) myoglobinuria may result from the breakdown of skeletal muscle known as rhabdomyolysis , a condition in which muscle cells breakdown , sending their contents into the bloodstream in the long term , patients may exhibit kidney failure due to the myoglobinuria , and with age , patients may exhibit progressively increasing weakness and substantial muscle loss patients may present at emergency rooms with severe fixed contractures of the muscles and often severe pain in 2006 , another mutation ( c.13_14delct ) was discovered which may contribute to increased symptoms in addition to the common arg50stop mutation the enzyme phosphorylase kinase plays a role in phosphorylating glycogen phosphorylase to activate it and another enzyme , protein phosphatase 1 , inactivates glycogen phosphorylase through dephosphorylation dna sequencing of the pygm gene ( which codes for the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase ) may be done to determine the presence of mutation , determining if mcardle 's is present findings consistent with mcardle 's disease would include a failure of lactate in venous blood and exaggerated ammonia levels serum lactate may fail to rise in part because of increased uptake via the monocarboxylate transporter 1 , which is upregulated in skeletal muscle in mcardle disease ammonia levels may rise given ammonia is a by-product of the adenylate kinase , an alternative pathway for atp production in some , the level is increased by multitudes - a person without gsd-v will have a ck between 60 and 400iu/l , while a person with the syndrome may have a level of 5,000 iu/l at rest , and may increase to 35,000 iu/l or more with muscle exertion mcardle noticed this patient 's cramps were electrically silent and his venous lactate levels failed to increase upon ischemic exercise international association for muscle glycogen storage disease ( iamgsd ) .

the federal reserve directly controls only the most narrow form of money , physical cash outstanding along with the reserves of banks throughout the country ( known as m0 or the monetary base ) ; the federal reserve indirectly influences the supply of other types of money broad money includes money held in deposit balances in banks and other forms created in the financial system basic economics also teaches that the money supply shrinks when loans are repaid ; however , the money supply will not necessarily decrease depending on the creation of new loans and other effects other than loans , investment activities of commercial banks and the federal reserve also increase and decrease the money supply discussion of '' money '' often confuses the different measures and may lead to misguided commentary on monetary policy and misunderstandings of policy discussions willem buiter , professor , london school of economics , '' long live debt '' , financial times '' maverecon blog '' , october 13 , 2007 monetary policy in the us is determined and implemented by the us federal reserve system , commonly referred to as the federal reserve established in 1913 by the federal reserve act to provide central banking functions , the federal reserve system is a quasi-public institution ostensibly , the federal reserve banks are 12 private banking corporations ; they are independent in their day-to-day operations , but legislatively accountable to congress through the auspices of federal reserve board of governors the presidents of the federal reserve banks are nominated by each bank 's respective board of directors , but must also be approved by the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve system is primarily funded by interest collected on their portfolio of securities from the us treasury , and the fed has broad discretion in drafting its own budget , but , historically , nearly all the interest the federal reserve collects is rebated to the government each year ) , '' debunking the federal reserve conspiracy theories '' , public eye ( political research associates ) the federal reserve has three main mechanisms for manipulating the money supply '' reserve requirements '' , fedpoints , federal reserve bank of new york at a reserve requirement of zero , the money multiplier is undefined , because calculating it would involve division by zero the federal funds rate , for which the federal open market committee announces a target on a regular basis , reflects one of the key rates for interbank lending open market operations change the supply of reserve balances , and the federal funds rate is sensitive to these operations the federal reserve increases interest rates to combat inflation it is a government bond instrument issued by the united states department of the treasury to finance government spending as an alternative to taxation since 2012 the management of government debt has been arranged by the bureau of the fiscal service , succeeding the bureau of the public debt when money is deposited in a bank , it can then be lent out to another person however , because the depositor can ask for the money back , banks have to maintain minimum reserves to service customer needs if the reserve requirement is 10 % then , in the earlier example , the bank can lend 90 and thus the money supply increases by only 90 because the reserve requirement only applies to the more narrow forms of money creation ( corresponding to m1 ) , but does not apply to certain types of deposits ( such as time deposits ) , reserve requirements play a limited role in monetary policy '' reserve requirements '' , fedpoints , federal reserve bank of new york the process of money creation usually goes as follows : banks go through their daily transactions every business day , the federal reserve system engages in open market operations if the federal reserve wants to increase the money supply , it will buy securities ( such as u.s if the federal reserve wants to decrease the money supply , it will sell securities to the banks in exchange for dollars , taking those dollars out of circulation the money that it deposits into the seller 's account is not transferred from any existing funds , therefore it is at this point that the federal reserve has created high-powered money by means of open market operations , the federal reserve affects the free reserves of commercial banks in the country when they believe they need more cash than they have on hand , banks can make requests for cash with the federal reserve in turn , the federal reserve examines these requests and places an order for printed money with the us treasury department the treasury department sends these requests to the bureau of engraving and printing ( to make dollar bills ) and the bureau of the mint ( to stamp the coins ) aside from printing costs , the federal reserve must pledge collateral ( typically government securities such as treasury bonds ) to put new money , which does not replace old notes , into circulation federal reserve bank of new york , 2007 annual report , note h : federal reserve notes ( p though the federal reserve authorizes and distributes the currency printed by the treasury ( the primary component of the narrow monetary base ) , the broad money supply is primarily created by commercial banks through the money multiplier mechanism the vast majority of the broad money supply throughout the world represents current outstanding loans of banks to various debtors thus , use of expansionary open market operations typically generates more debt in the private sector of society ( in the form of additional bank deposits ) the concepts involved in monetary policy may be widely misunderstood in the general public , as evidenced by the volume of literature on topics such as '' federal reserve conspiracy '' and '' federal reserve fraud in particular , the theories of keynesianism and monetarism have had great influence on both the theory and implementation of monetary policy , and the '' prevailing wisdom '' or consensus view of the economic and financial communities has changed over the years elastic currency ( magnitude of the money multiplier ) : the success of monetary policy is dependent on the ability to strongly influence the supply of money available to the citizens the federal reserve regulates banking , and one regulation under its direct control is the reserve requirement which dictates how much money banks must keep in reserves , as compared to its demand deposits free banking

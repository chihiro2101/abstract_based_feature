the camera can be attached directly to the kite but is usually secured to an adjustable rig suspended from the kite line at a distance from the kite this distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher , stable air before the camera is attached in order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon , a suspension method is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line gravity naturally keeps the rig level , irrespective of the angle of the kite line a single line is threaded several times between the points of the cross and the points of attachment to the kite line and the rig is attached to the cross the shutter of the camera can be released in several ways , depending on the type of camera and complexity of the rig electronics , if used if the camera is fitted within a frame , this 'rig ' can be designed to rotate horizontally and vertically and to change the picture format from portrait to landscape by rotating the camera with the advent of the internet , light and affordable digital cameras , radio control and microelectronics , kite aerial photography has become increasingly popular research scientists are using kite aerial photography for monitoring bird species and also for studies in the geographical and geological sciences , including photogrammetry balloon experiments with amateur radio panoramic photography aerial archaeology

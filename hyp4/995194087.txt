the camera can be attached directly to the kite but is usually secured to an adjustable rig suspended from the kite line at a distance from the kite this distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher , stable air before the camera is attached cameras using internal image stabilization features can increase the number of sharp photos in order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon , a suspension method is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line the pendulum will oscillate due to movement from the kite line and wind pressure , but the camera will remain steadier and more level than without a pendulum a single line is threaded several times between the points of the cross and the points of attachment to the kite line and the rig is attached to the cross image : bartlow hills - cc by-sa bill blake.jpg thumb right a picture of bartlow hills , taken using kite aerial photography the famous kite image of san francisco after the 1906 earthquake ( right ) was taken by an early pioneer in kap , george lawrence using a large panoramic camera and stabilizing rig he designed with the advent of the internet , light and affordable digital cameras , radio control and microelectronics , kite aerial photography has become increasingly popular research scientists are using kite aerial photography for monitoring bird species and also for studies in the geographical and geological sciences , including photogrammetry

the camera can be attached directly to the kite but is usually secured to an adjustable rig suspended from the kite line at a distance from the kite this distance reduces excessive movement being transmitted from the kite to the camera and allows the kite to be flown into higher , stable air before the camera is attached in order to take photographs that are oriented correctly with the horizon , a suspension method is used to allow the rig to automatically level itself under the kite line the pendulum will oscillate due to movement from the kite line and wind pressure , but the camera will remain steadier and more level than without a pendulum the shutter of the camera can be released in several ways , depending on the type of camera and complexity of the rig electronics , if used image : bartlow hills - cc by-sa bill blake.jpg thumb right a picture of bartlow hills , taken using kite aerial photography the first kite aerial photography were taken by british meteorologist douglas archibald in 1887 archibald , douglas ( 1897 ) with the advent of the internet , light and affordable digital cameras , radio control and microelectronics , kite aerial photography has become increasingly popular research scientists are using kite aerial photography for monitoring bird species and also for studies in the geographical and geological sciences , including photogrammetry balloon experiments with amateur radio panoramic photography aerial archaeology

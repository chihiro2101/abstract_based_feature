the concertgebouw orchestra was established several months later and gave its first concert in the concertgebouw on 3 november 1888 this performance was conducted by the orchestra 's first chief conductor , willem kes in 1895 , willem mengelberg became chief conductor and remained in this position for fifty years , an unusually long tenure for a music director he is generally regarded as having brought the orchestra to a level of major international significance , with a particular championing of such then-contemporary composers as gustav mahler and richard strauss for approximately its first 75 years , the concertgebouw orchestra had a somewhat complicated roster of conductors from 1945 to 1959 , the orchestra 's principal conductor was eduard van beinum , who had debuted with the orchestra in 1929 he had become the second conductor of the orchestra in 1931 , and co-principal conductor in 1938 van beinum served as sole chief conductor of the orchestra after world war ii until his sudden death on the concertgebouw podium from a heart attack in april 1959 riccardo chailly made his debut with the concertgebouw orchestra in 1985 , and was elected that year as their next chief conductor to succeed haitink another factor in creating the orchestra 's distinct character is that the concertgebouw orchestra has had only six chief conductors , setting it apart from orchestras of similar age and caliber the orchestra also serves as one of the opera orchestras for productions of the dutch national opera past artistic directors of the concertgebouw orchestra have included rudolf mengelberg ( 1925-1955 ) , marius flothuis ( 1955â€“1974 ) , hein van royen ( 1974-1991 ) and peter ruzicka

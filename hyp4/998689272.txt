he graduated from campbell high school , where he played football offered both athletic and academic scholarships to stanford university , herschbach chose the academic johnston , hired him as a summer research assistant , and taught him chemical kinetics in his senior year in 1959 , herschbach joined the university of california at berkeley , where he was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry and became an associate professor in 1961 at berkeley , he and graduate students george kwei and james norris constructed a cross-beam instrument large enough for reactive scattering experiments involve alkali and various molecular partners there he continued his work on molecular-beam reactive dynamics , working with graduate students sanford safron and walter miller on the reactions of alkali atoms with alkali halides crossing collimated beams of gas-phase reactants allows partitioning of energy among translational , rotational , and vibrational modes of the product moleculesâ€”a vital aspect of understanding reaction dynamics in the course of his life 's work in research , herschbach has published over 400 scientific papers his recent work also includes a collaboration with steven brams studying approval voting hershbach 's teaching ranges from graduate seminars on chemical kinetics to an introductory undergraduate course in general chemistry that he taught for many years at harvard , and described as his '' most challenging assignment '' reactive collisions in crossed molecular beams '' , university of california , lawrence radiation laboratory , berkeley , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) ( february 1962 ) laurie , v '' proposed molecular beam determination of energy partition in the photodissociation of polyatomic molecules '' , university of california , lawrence radiation laboratory , berkeley , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) ( january 29 , 1964 )

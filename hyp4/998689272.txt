he was awarded a three-year junior fellowship in the society of fellows at harvard , lasting from 1957 to 1959 in 1959 , herschbach joined the university of california at berkeley , where he was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry and became an associate professor in 1961 at berkeley , he and graduate students george kwei and james norris constructed a cross-beam instrument large enough for reactive scattering experiments involve alkali and various molecular partners his interest in studying elementary chemical processes in molecular-beam reactive collisions challenged an often-accepted belief that '' collisions do not occur in crossed molecular beams '' subsequent studies of k + br 2 resulted in the discovery that the hot-wire surface ionization detector they were using was potentially contaminated by previous use , and had to be pre-treated to obtain reliable results changes to the instrumentation yielded reliable results , including the observation that the k + br 2 reaction involved a stripping reaction , in which the kbr product scattered forward from the incident k atom beam as the research continued , it became possible to correlate the electronic structure of reactants and products with the reaction dynamics in 1963 , herschbach returned to harvard university as a professor of chemistry there he continued his work on molecular-beam reactive dynamics , working with graduate students sanford safron and walter miller on the reactions of alkali atoms with alkali halides herschbach has applied his broad expertise in both the theory and practice of chemistry and physics to diverse problems in chemical physics , including theoretical work on dimensional scaling '' anharmonic potential constants and their dependence upon bond length '' , university of california , lawrence radiation laboratory , berkeley , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) ( january 1961 ) herschbach , d '' reactive collisions in crossed molecular beams '' , university of california , lawrence radiation laboratory , berkeley , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) ( february 1962 ) laurie , v

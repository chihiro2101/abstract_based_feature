the rate and outcome of chemical reactions taking place in water often depends on the acidity of the water , and it is therefore useful to know the acidity of the water , typically measured by means of a ph meter knowledge of ph is useful or critical in many situations , including chemical laboratory analyses advances in the instrumentation and in detection have expanded the number of applications in which ph measurements can be conducted in addition to measuring the ph of liquids , specially designed electrodes are available to measure the ph of semi-solid substances , such as foods potentiometric ph meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding ph value they comprise a simple electronic amplifier and a pair of electrodes , or alternatively a combination electrode , and some form of display calibrated in ph units the electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to ph units the magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the ph according to the nernst equation the reference electrode is insensitive to the ph of the solution , being composed of a metallic conductor , which connects to the display on immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution , an electrical circuit is completed , in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter all other potential differences in the circuit do not vary with ph and are corrected for by means of the calibration bitesize bio : how to care for your ph meter , steffi magub , 18 may 2012 . ph electrode and reference electrode design details of the fabrication and resulting microstructure of the glass membrane of the ph electrode are maintained as trade secrets by the manufacturers the ph meter has one calibration control to set the meter reading equal to the value of the first standard buffer and a second control to adjust the meter reading to the value of the second buffer in 2004 the beckman ph meter was designated an national historic chemical landmarks in recognition of its significance as the first commercially successful electronic ph meter . building a ph meter ion-selective electrodes isfet ph electrode potentiometry quinhydrone electrode saturated calomel electrode silver chloride electrode standard hydrogen electrode

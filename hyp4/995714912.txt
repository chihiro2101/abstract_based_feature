advances in the instrumentation and in detection have expanded the number of applications in which ph measurements can be conducted in addition to measuring the ph of liquids , specially designed electrodes are available to measure the ph of semi-solid substances , such as foods potentiometric ph meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding ph value the glass electrode for measuring the ph has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration on immersion in the solution to be tested , hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb , creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb the electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to ph units the magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the ph according to the nernst equation the reference electrode is insensitive to the ph of the solution , being composed of a metallic conductor , which connects to the display this conductor is immersed in an electrolyte solution , typically potassium chloride , which comes into contact with the test solution through a porous ceramic membrane on immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution , an electrical circuit is completed , in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter for simplicity , many ph meters use a combination probe , constructed with the glass electrode and the reference electrode contained within a single probe the ph meter is calibrated with solutions of known ph , typically before each use , to ensure accuracy of measurement to measure the ph of a solution , the electrodes are used as probes , which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode . ph electrode and reference electrode design the silver chloride electrode is most commonly used as a reference electrode in ph meters , although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode there are also holographic ph sensors , which allow ph measurement colorimetrically , making use of the variety of ph indicators that are available in 2004 the beckman ph meter was designated an national historic chemical landmarks in recognition of its significance as the first commercially successful electronic ph meter ion-selective electrodes isfet ph electrode potentiometry quinhydrone electrode saturated calomel electrode silver chloride electrode standard hydrogen electrode

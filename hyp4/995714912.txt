the rate and outcome of chemical reactions taking place in water often depends on the acidity of the water , and it is therefore useful to know the acidity of the water , typically measured by means of a ph meter in addition to measuring the ph of liquids , specially designed electrodes are available to measure the ph of semi-solid substances , such as foods they comprise a simple electronic amplifier and a pair of electrodes , or alternatively a combination electrode , and some form of display calibrated in ph units it usually has a glass electrode and a reference electrode , or a combination electrode the glass electrode for measuring the ph has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration on immersion in the solution to be tested , hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb , creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb the electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to ph units the display consists of a voltmeter , which displays voltage in units of ph on immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution , an electrical circuit is completed , in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter the circuit can be thought of as going from the conductive element of the reference electrode to the surrounding potassium-chloride solution , through the ceramic membrane to the test solution , the hydrogen-ion-selective glass of the glass electrode , to the solution inside the glass electrode , to the silver of the glass electrode , and finally the voltmeter of the display device the voltage varies from test solution to test solution depending on the potential difference created by the difference in hydrogen-ion concentrations on each side of the glass membrane between the test solution and the solution inside the glass electrode for simplicity , many ph meters use a combination probe , constructed with the glass electrode and the reference electrode contained within a single probe the ph meter is calibrated with solutions of known ph , typically before each use , to ensure accuracy of measurement to measure the ph of a solution , the electrodes are used as probes , which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode details of the fabrication and resulting microstructure of the glass membrane of the ph electrode are maintained as trade secrets by the manufacturers the silver chloride electrode is most commonly used as a reference electrode in ph meters , although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode however , with purchase of suitable electrodes , a standard multimeter can be used to complete the construction of the ph meter ion-selective electrodes isfet ph electrode potentiometry quinhydrone electrode saturated calomel electrode silver chloride electrode standard hydrogen electrode

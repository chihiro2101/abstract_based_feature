the rate and outcome of chemical reactions taking place in water often depends on the acidity of the water , and it is therefore useful to know the acidity of the water , typically measured by means of a ph meter knowledge of ph is useful or critical in many situations , including chemical laboratory analyses in addition to measuring the ph of liquids , specially designed electrodes are available to measure the ph of semi-solid substances , such as foods potentiometric ph meters measure the voltage between two electrodes and display the result converted into the corresponding ph value they comprise a simple electronic amplifier and a pair of electrodes , or alternatively a combination electrode , and some form of display calibrated in ph units it usually has a glass electrode and a reference electrode , or a combination electrode the glass electrode for measuring the ph has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration the electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to ph units the magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the ph according to the nernst equation the reference electrode is insensitive to the ph of the solution , being composed of a metallic conductor , which connects to the display on immersion of the glass electrode and the reference electrode in the test solution , an electrical circuit is completed , in which there is a potential difference created and detected by the voltmeter the voltage varies from test solution to test solution depending on the potential difference created by the difference in hydrogen-ion concentrations on each side of the glass membrane between the test solution and the solution inside the glass electrode the ph meter is calibrated with solutions of known ph , typically before each use , to ensure accuracy of measurement to measure the ph of a solution , the electrodes are used as probes , which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions on the surface of the bulb on the glass electrode . ph electrode and reference electrode design the silver chloride electrode is most commonly used as a reference electrode in ph meters , although some designs use the saturated calomel electrode in 2004 the beckman ph meter was designated an national historic chemical landmarks in recognition of its significance as the first commercially successful electronic ph meter ion-selective electrodes isfet ph electrode potentiometry quinhydrone electrode saturated calomel electrode silver chloride electrode standard hydrogen electrode

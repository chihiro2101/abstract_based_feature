the first images picturing the distinct japanese asymmetrical longbow are from the yayoi period ( c yamada shōji , the myth of zen in the art of archery , japanese journal of religious studies 2001 28/1–2 the changing of society and the military class ( samurai ) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery this led to the birth of the first kyujutsu ryūha ( style ) , the henmi-ryū , founded by henmi kiyomitsu in the 12th century the need for archers grew dramatically during the genpei war ( 1180–1185 ) and as a result the founder of the ogasawara-ryū ( ogasawara nagakiyo ) , began teaching yabusame ( mounted archery ) many new schools were formed , some of which , such as heki-ryū chikurin-ha , heki-ryū sekka-ha and heki-ryū insai-ha , remain today the yumi as a weapon of war began its decline after the portuguese arrived in japan in 1543 bringing firearms with them in the form of the matchlock the yumi as a weapon was used alongside the tanegashima for a period of time because of its longer reach , accuracy and especially because it had a rate of fire 30–40 times faster there was an extended era of peace during which the samurai moved to administrative duty , although the traditional fighting skills were still esteemed during this period archery became a '' voluntary '' skill , practised partly in the court in ceremonial form , partly as different kinds of competition archery spread also outside the warrior class earlier archery had been called kyūjutsu , the skill of bow , but monks acting even as martial arts teachers led to creation of a new concept : kyūdō during the changes to japan brought by opening up to the outside world at the beginning of the meiji era ( 1868–1912 ) , the samurai lost their status therefore , all martial arts , including kyūdō , saw a significant decrease in instruction and appreciation in 1896 , a group of kyūdō masters gathered to save traditional archery however , it took until 1949 before the all japanese kyudo federation ( ankf ; japanese : zen nihon kyūdō renmei ) was formed guidelines published in the 1953 kyūdō kyohon define how , in a competition or graduation , archers from different schools can shoot together in unified form kyūdō is practised in many different schools , some of which descend from military shooting and others that descend from ceremonial or contemplative practice in certain schools , to shoot correctly will result inevitably in hitting the desired target according to the nippon kyūdō federation the supreme goal of kyūdō is the state of shin-zen-bi , roughly '' truth-goodness-beauty '' , kyudo manual , volume 1 , all nippon kyudo federation ( revised edition ) which can be approximated as : when archers shoot correctly ( i.e truthfully ) with virtuous spirit and attitude toward all persons and all things which relate to kyūdō ( i.e today many archers practise kyūdō as a sport , with marksmanship being paramount however , the goal most devotees of kyūdō seek is seisha seichū , '' correct shooting is correct hitting '' when the technique of the shooting is correct the result is that the arrow hits the target this however is not zen , although japanese bow can be used in zen-practice or kyūdō practised by a zen master since the second world war kyūdō has often been associated with zen buddhism his view on kyūdō was in part due to mis-communication and also to his exposure to a contemplative form of kyūdō because the target is so close and the shot most certainly will hit , the archer can concentrate on refining technique rather than on the arrow 's arc the is exceptionally tall ( standing over two metres ) , surpassing the height of the archer kyūdō archers usually shoot two ya per round , with the haya being shot first ( haya means first arrow ; otoya means second arrow ) it is often said that the alternate spinning direction of the arrows would prevent two consecutive identically shot arrows from flying identically and thus colliding left the kyūdō archer wears a glove on the right hand , called a practitioners can choose between a hard glove ( with a hardened thumb ) or a soft glove ( without a hardened thumb ) ; each has its advantages this is only a generalization and many schools differ on which glove to use for their bows and glove use often varies from archer to archer and school to school the one-finger glove , called an ippongake is generally used for beginners and covers only the thumb because it has no glove over the fingers , it is typically uncomfortable for the archer to use giriko powder the five-finger glove , called a morogake , is used almost exclusively by ogasawara ryū practitioners , and is not typically used in competition or by any other school thumb because of the unique shooting technique of kyūdō , protection on the left ( bow ) arm is not generally required the archer then sights from the target to the feet and with the feet set apart so that the distance between them is equal to the archer 's yazuka , about half his body height , and equal to the length of an arrow a line drawn between the archer 's toes should pass through the target after the completion of the ashibumi while kyūdō is primarily viewed as an avenue toward self-improvement , there are often kyūdō competitions or tournaments whereby archers practise in a competitive style once all the archers have shot , the archer will then pick up the second pair of arrows at the feet and repeat the process , starting with the second flight 's haya many japanese high schools and colleges have kyūdō clubs ( bukatsu ) in which students gather after regular classes to practise kyūdō next was los angeles with a group called the rafu kyudo kai or los angeles kyudo kyudo kai ( rafu was the method the local japanese used for l.a kasagake - a type of japanese mounted archery ;

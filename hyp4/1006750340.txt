yamada shōji , the myth of zen in the art of archery , japanese journal of religious studies 2001 28/1–2 the changing of society and the military class ( samurai ) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery this led to the birth of the first kyujutsu ryūha ( style ) , the henmi-ryū , founded by henmi kiyomitsu in the 12th century green , martial arts of the world , 2001 the takeda-ryū and the mounted archery school ogasawara-ryū were later founded by his descendants the need for archers grew dramatically during the genpei war ( 1180–1185 ) and as a result the founder of the ogasawara-ryū ( ogasawara nagakiyo ) , began teaching yabusame ( mounted archery ) the yumi as a weapon of war began its decline after the portuguese arrived in japan in 1543 bringing firearms with them in the form of the matchlock the yumi as a weapon was used alongside the tanegashima for a period of time because of its longer reach , accuracy and especially because it had a rate of fire 30–40 times faster there was an extended era of peace during which the samurai moved to administrative duty , although the traditional fighting skills were still esteemed earlier archery had been called kyūjutsu , the skill of bow , but monks acting even as martial arts teachers led to creation of a new concept : kyūdō therefore , all martial arts , including kyūdō , saw a significant decrease in instruction and appreciation honda toshizane , the kyūdō teacher for the imperial university of tokyo , merged the war and ceremonial shooting styles , creating a hybrid called honda-ryū however , it took until 1949 before the all japanese kyudo federation ( ankf ; japanese : zen nihon kyūdō renmei ) was formed guidelines published in the 1953 kyūdō kyohon define how , in a competition or graduation , archers from different schools can shoot together in unified form kyūdō is practised in many different schools , some of which descend from military shooting and others that descend from ceremonial or contemplative practice truthfully ) with virtuous spirit and attitude toward all persons and all things which relate to kyūdō ( i.e today many archers practise kyūdō as a sport , with marksmanship being paramount however , the goal most devotees of kyūdō seek is seisha seichū , '' correct shooting is correct hitting '' when the technique of the shooting is correct the result is that the arrow hits the target to give oneself completely to the shooting is the spiritual goal , achieved by perfection of both the spirit and shooting technique leading to munen musō , '' no thoughts , no illusions '' genishiro inagaki , 1980 in bagge 2001 , kyudo - japanilainen jousiammunta , in this respect , many kyūdō practitioners believe that competition , examination , and any opportunity that places the archer in this uncompromising situation is important , while other practitioners will avoid competitions or examinations of any kind since the second world war kyūdō has often been associated with zen buddhism this popular view is likely the result of a single book zen in the art of archery ( 1948 ) by the german author eugen herrigel even so , herrigel 's book , when translated into japanese in 1956 , had a huge impact on perception of kyūdō also in japan zenko ( a heki ryu bishu chikurin-ha school of kyūdō ) is affiliated closely with shambhala buddhism and has groups in the united states , canada and europe kyūdō is practised in different schools and styles and even between dōjōs of the same style , the form of practice can vary genishiro inagaki , 1989 in bagge 2001 , kyudo - japanilainen jousiammunta , beginners start with a rubber practice bow and by practising the movements of hassetsu the second step for a beginner is to do karabiki training with a bow without an arrow to learn handling of the bow and performing hassetsu until full draw after given permission by the teacher beginners start practicing with the glove and arrow next steps may vary from teacher to teacher , but include practising first yugamae , then the draw and last release and shooting at makiwara because the target is so close and the shot most certainly will hit , the archer can concentrate on refining technique rather than on the arrow 's arc shafts are traditionally made of bamboo , with either eagle or hawk feathers it is often said that the alternate spinning direction of the arrows would prevent two consecutive identically shot arrows from flying identically and thus colliding ya are normally kept in a cylindrical quiver , called a yazutsu , with ceremonial and traditional archers using the yebira practitioners can choose between a hard glove ( with a hardened thumb ) or a soft glove ( without a hardened thumb ) ; each has its advantages this is only a generalization and many schools differ on which glove to use for their bows and glove use often varies from archer to archer and school to school thumb the practical reasoning for the extra finger on the glove stems from having more surface area available to the archer for the heavier draws sometimes a type of resin powder , called giriko is applied to the thumb and holding finger to assist in the grip during the pull the extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb , as it is then placed on the third finger of the hand instead of the second the one-finger glove , called an ippongake is generally used for beginners and covers only the thumb the bow string , when properly released , will travel around the bow hand , coming to rest on the outside of the arm kyūdō archers draw the bow so that the drawing hand is held behind the ear during competition , an archer may have a second set of arrows sitting on the ground at the feet in japanese kyūdō competitions , an archer shoots four arrows in two sets , placing one pair of arrows at his feet and retaining the second pair at the ready mounted archery ( kyubajutsu ) takeda-ryū（武田流） ogasawara-ryū（小笠原流） foot archery heki-ryū（日置流） heki-ryū chikurin-ha（竹林派） bishū chikurin-ha（尾州竹林派） kishū chikurin-ha（紀州竹林派） heki-ryū insai-ha ( aka the hawaii chozen-ji temple , a rinzai zen institution founded in 1972 , began kyūdō teaching in 1979–80 , with master suhara osho visiting from japan international kyudo federation european kyudo federation all nippon kyudo federation

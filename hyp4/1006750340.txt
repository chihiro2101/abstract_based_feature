the first images picturing the distinct japanese asymmetrical longbow are from the yayoi period ( c yamada shōji , the myth of zen in the art of archery , japanese journal of religious studies 2001 28/1–2 the changing of society and the military class ( samurai ) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery the need for archers grew dramatically during the genpei war ( 1180–1185 ) and as a result the founder of the ogasawara-ryū ( ogasawara nagakiyo ) , began teaching yabusame ( mounted archery ) many new schools were formed , some of which , such as heki-ryū chikurin-ha , heki-ryū sekka-ha and heki-ryū insai-ha , remain today the yumi as a weapon of war began its decline after the portuguese arrived in japan in 1543 bringing firearms with them in the form of the matchlock during the edo period ( 1603–1868 ) japan was turned inward as a hierarchical caste society in which the samurai were at the top there was an extended era of peace during which the samurai moved to administrative duty , although the traditional fighting skills were still esteemed archery spread also outside the warrior class the samurai were affected by the straightforward philosophy and aim for self-control in zen buddhism that was introduced by chinese monks earlier archery had been called kyūjutsu , the skill of bow , but monks acting even as martial arts teachers led to creation of a new concept : kyūdō during the changes to japan brought by opening up to the outside world at the beginning of the meiji era ( 1868–1912 ) , the samurai lost their status in 1896 , a group of kyūdō masters gathered to save traditional archery honda toshizane , the kyūdō teacher for the imperial university of tokyo , merged the war and ceremonial shooting styles , creating a hybrid called honda-ryū however , it took until 1949 before the all japanese kyudo federation ( ankf ; japanese : zen nihon kyūdō renmei ) was formed guidelines published in the 1953 kyūdō kyohon define how , in a competition or graduation , archers from different schools can shoot together in unified form kyūdō is practised in many different schools , some of which descend from military shooting and others that descend from ceremonial or contemplative practice in certain schools , to shoot correctly will result inevitably in hitting the desired target according to the nippon kyūdō federation the supreme goal of kyūdō is the state of shin-zen-bi , roughly '' truth-goodness-beauty '' , kyudo manual , volume 1 , all nippon kyudo federation ( revised edition ) which can be approximated as : when archers shoot correctly ( i.e kyūdō practice , as in all budō , includes the idea of moral and spiritual development in kyūdō the unique action of expansion ( nobiai ) that results in a natural release , is sought this however is not zen , although japanese bow can be used in zen-practice or kyūdō practised by a zen master genishiro inagaki , 1980 in bagge 2001 , kyudo - japanilainen jousiammunta , in this respect , many kyūdō practitioners believe that competition , examination , and any opportunity that places the archer in this uncompromising situation is important , while other practitioners will avoid competitions or examinations of any kind this popular view is likely the result of a single book zen in the art of archery ( 1948 ) by the german author eugen herrigel zenko ( a heki ryu bishu chikurin-ha school of kyūdō ) is affiliated closely with shambhala buddhism and has groups in the united states , canada and europe kyūdō is practised in different schools and styles and even between dōjōs of the same style , the form of practice can vary the makiwara is shot at from a very close range ( about seven feet , or the length of the archer 's strung yumi when held horizontally from the centerline of the archer 's body ) mato is the normal target for most kyūdō practitioners the suitable height for the bow depends on the archer 's draw ( yazuka ) which is about half the archer 's height left the kyūdō archer wears a glove on the right hand , called a the three fingered version is called a mitsugake , and the four-fingered version is called a yotsugake this is only a generalization and many schools differ on which glove to use for their bows and glove use often varies from archer to archer and school to school thumb the practical reasoning for the extra finger on the glove stems from having more surface area available to the archer for the heavier draws the extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb , as it is then placed on the third finger of the hand instead of the second the one-finger glove , called an ippongake is generally used for beginners and covers only the thumb because it has no glove over the fingers , it is typically uncomfortable for the archer to use giriko powder with the exception of the ippongake , the yugake is worn with an underglove called a shitagake made of cotton or synthetic cloth , mainly to protect the yugake from sweat which would degrade the deerskin of the glove over time the shitagake comes in two varieties , three-fingered and four-fingered , depending on whether it is used under the mitsugake or the yotsugake however , on rare occasions a bow hand glove , called an oshidegake , is used , which serves to protect the left thumb from injury from the arrow and fletching powder made of burnt rice husks called fudeko is applied to the hand that holds the bow to absorb sweat , allowing the bow to turn in the hand hence , many archers carry spare strings in what is called a tsurumaki ( '' bow string roll '' ) all kyūdō archers hold the bow in their left hand and draw the string with their right , so that all archers face the higher position ( kamiza ) while shooting judo , karate ) , kyūdō is one of the japanese martial arts that has not seen large amounts of mainstream interest in the west when many of the japanese were interned in camps , during the world war , all of the groups ( except the hawaii kyudo kai ) disbanded ; the hawaii kyudo kai simply quietly practiced almost in secret shihan mato – a traditional style of japanese archery using a short bow from a seated position international kyudo federation european kyudo federation all nippon kyudo federation

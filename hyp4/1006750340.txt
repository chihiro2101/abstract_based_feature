the first images picturing the distinct japanese asymmetrical longbow are from the yayoi period ( c yamada shōji , the myth of zen in the art of archery , japanese journal of religious studies 2001 28/1–2 the changing of society and the military class ( samurai ) taking power at the end of the first millennium created a requirement for education in archery this led to the birth of the first kyujutsu ryūha ( style ) , the henmi-ryū , founded by henmi kiyomitsu in the 12th century green , martial arts of the world , 2001 the takeda-ryū and the mounted archery school ogasawara-ryū were later founded by his descendants the need for archers grew dramatically during the genpei war ( 1180–1185 ) and as a result the founder of the ogasawara-ryū ( ogasawara nagakiyo ) , began teaching yabusame ( mounted archery ) many new schools were formed , some of which , such as heki-ryū chikurin-ha , heki-ryū sekka-ha and heki-ryū insai-ha , remain today however , it took until 1949 before the all japanese kyudo federation ( ankf ; japanese : zen nihon kyūdō renmei ) was formed guidelines published in the 1953 kyūdō kyohon define how , in a competition or graduation , archers from different schools can shoot together in unified form in certain schools , to shoot correctly will result inevitably in hitting the desired target according to the nippon kyūdō federation the supreme goal of kyūdō is the state of shin-zen-bi , roughly '' truth-goodness-beauty '' , kyudo manual , volume 1 , all nippon kyudo federation ( revised edition ) which can be approximated as : when archers shoot correctly ( i.e truthfully ) with virtuous spirit and attitude toward all persons and all things which relate to kyūdō ( i.e kyūdō practice , as in all budō , includes the idea of moral and spiritual development however , the goal most devotees of kyūdō seek is seisha seichū , '' correct shooting is correct hitting '' this however is not zen , although japanese bow can be used in zen-practice or kyūdō practised by a zen master but not all kyūdō schools include a religious or spiritual component his view on kyūdō was in part due to mis-communication and also to his exposure to a contemplative form of kyūdō kyūdō is practised in different schools and styles and even between dōjōs of the same style , the form of practice can vary to harmonize practice and ceremonial shooting ( sharei ) in 1953 the all nippon kyūdō federation ( ankf ) formed an establishing committee from the main schools to take the best elements of each school and form the ankf style that is used today throughout japan and in most kyūdō federations in the west the second step for a beginner is to do karabiki training with a bow without an arrow to learn handling of the bow and performing hassetsu until full draw after given permission by the teacher beginners start practicing with the glove and arrow next steps may vary from teacher to teacher , but include practising first yugamae , then the draw and last release and shooting at makiwara a beginner starting to shoot at the mato may be asked to shoot from half or three-quarters of the usual distance ) advanced beginners and advanced shooters practise shooting at makiwara , mato and some with omato because the target is so close and the shot most certainly will hit , the archer can concentrate on refining technique rather than on the arrow 's arc kyūdō archers usually shoot two ya per round , with the haya being shot first ( haya means first arrow ; otoya means second arrow ) ya are normally kept in a cylindrical quiver , called a yazutsu , with ceremonial and traditional archers using the yebira practitioners can choose between a hard glove ( with a hardened thumb ) or a soft glove ( without a hardened thumb ) ; each has its advantages the three fingered version is called a mitsugake , and the four-fingered version is called a yotsugake typically the primary reason an archer may choose a stronger glove like the yotsugake is to assist in pulling heavier bows and above ) the three-fingered glove is generally used with bows with a pull below 20 kilograms of draw weight , while the four fingered yotsugake are used with bows with a pull above 20 kilograms this is only a generalization and many schools differ on which glove to use for their bows and glove use often varies from archer to archer and school to school sometimes a type of resin powder , called giriko is applied to the thumb and holding finger to assist in the grip during the pull the extra finger allows for a stronger hold on the thumb , as it is then placed on the third finger of the hand instead of the second some schools , such as heki-ryū insai-ha only use the three-fingered glove , even with bows above 40 kilograms some versions have a full wrist covering and others simply cover the thumb with a small strap and snap around the wrist thumb because of the unique shooting technique of kyūdō , protection on the left ( bow ) arm is not generally required however , on rare occasions a bow hand glove , called an oshidegake , is used , which serves to protect the left thumb from injury from the arrow and fletching hence , many archers carry spare strings in what is called a tsurumaki ( '' bow string roll '' ) all kyūdō archers hold the bow in their left hand and draw the string with their right , so that all archers face the higher position ( kamiza ) while shooting if done improperly , upon release the string may strike the archer 's ear or side of the face the all nippon kyudo federation ( ankf ) , the main governing body of kyūdō in japan , has codified the hassetsu ( or '' eight stages of shooting '' ) in the kyūdō kyohon ( '' kyūdō manual '' ) the archer starts bringing down the bow while spreading his arms , simultaneously pushing the bow with the left hand and drawing the string with the right while kyūdō is primarily viewed as an avenue toward self-improvement , there are often kyūdō competitions or tournaments whereby archers practise in a competitive style during normal competition , this process is done with the archers standing , however , the complete shooting procedure includes having the archer kneel in kiza while waiting between each shot jpg ura hazu ( top nock ) file : tsurumaki string holder 1.jpg tsurumaki ( string holder ) and tsuru ( string ) file : antique japanese ( samurai ) hankyū ( small yumi )

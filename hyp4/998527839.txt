, and gambling timeline of hooker 's life , sonoma league he was obviously unhappy and unsuccessful in his civilian pursuits because , in 1858 , he wrote to secretary of war john b at the start of the civil war in 1861 , hooker requested a commission , but his first application was rejected , possibly because of the lingering resentment harbored by winfield scott , general-in-chief of the army after he witnessed the union army defeat at the first battle of bull run , he wrote a letter to president abraham lincoln that complained of military mismanagement , promoted his own qualifications , and again requested a commission he was appointed , in august 1861 , as brigadier general of volunteers to rank from may 17 , as part of the effort to organize and train the new army of the potomac , under maj in the peninsula campaign of 1862 , hooker commanded the 2nd division of the iii corps and made a good name for himself as a combat leader who handled himself well and aggressively sought out the key points on battlefields on july 26 , hooker was promoted to major general , to rank from may 5 during the second battle of bull run , the iii corps was sent to reinforce john pope 's army of virginia following second bull run , hooker replaced irvin mcdowell as commander of the army of virginia 's iii corps , soon redesignated the i corps of the army of the potomac he asserted that the battle would have been a decisive union victory if he had managed to stay on the field , but general mcclellan 's caution once again failed the northern troops and lee 's much smaller army eluded destruction although hooker had criticized mcclellan persistently , the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early october , shortly before his termination , had recommended that hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army the war department promptly acted on this recommendation , and hooker received his brigadier 's commission to rank from september 20 the december 1862 battle of fredericksburg was another union debacle upon recovering from his foot wound , hooker was briefly made commander of v corps , but was then promoted to '' grand division '' command , with a command that consisted of both iii and v corps burnside followed up this battle with the humiliating mud march in january and hooker 's criticism of his commander bordered on formal insubordination army of the potomac lincoln appointed hooker to command of the army of the potomac on january 26 , 1863 some members of the army saw this move as inevitable , given hooker 's reputation for aggressive fighting , something sorely lacking in his predecessors during the '' mud march '' hooker was quoted by a new york times army correspondent as saying that '' nothing would go right until we had a dictator , and the sooner the better he also implemented corps badges as a means of identifying units during battle or when marching and to instill unit pride in the men the corps

command changes , including with his corps commanders edwin vose sumner were relieved of command , on burnside 's recommendation , in the same order appointing hooker to command ( both franklin and smith were considered suspect by hooker because of their previous political maneuvering against burnside and on behalf of mcclellan stone did not receive a command upon his release , mostly due to political pressures , which left him militarily exiled and disgraced army of the potomac historian and author bruce catton termed this request by hooker '' a strange and seemingly uncharacteristic thing '' and '' one of the most interesting things he ever did lee 's much smaller army at fredericksburg , while taking the large bulk of the army of the potomac on a flanking march to strike lee in his rear unfortunately for hooker and the union , the execution of his plan did not match the elegance of the plan itself from there , hooker pulled his army back to chancellorsville and waited for lee to attack lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of hooker 's army lee once again began an invasion of the north , in june 1863 , and lincoln urged hooker to pursue

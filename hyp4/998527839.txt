hooker was born in hadley , massachusetts , the grandson of a captain in the american revolutionary war homes of the massachusetts ancestors of major general joseph hooker , by isaac paul gragg his initial schooling was at the local hopkins academy he graduated from the united states military academy in 1837 , ranked 29th out of a class of 50 , and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st u.s he served in the mexicanâ€“american war in staff positions in the campaigns of both zachary taylor and winfield scott his future army reputation as a ladies ' man began in mexico , where local girls referred to him as the '' handsome captain '' timeline of hooker 's life , sonoma league he was obviously unhappy and unsuccessful in his civilian pursuits because , in 1858 , he wrote to secretary of war john b after he witnessed the union army defeat at the first battle of bull run , he wrote a letter to president abraham lincoln that complained of military mismanagement , promoted his own qualifications , and again requested a commission in the peninsula campaign of 1862 , hooker commanded the 2nd division of the iii corps and made a good name for himself as a combat leader who handled himself well and aggressively sought out the key points on battlefields hooker 's division did not play a major role in the seven days battles , although he and fellow division commander phil kearny tried unsuccessfully to urge mcclellan to counterattack the confederates '' the peninsula cemented two further reputations of hooker 's : his devotion to the welfare and morale of his men , and his hard drinking social life , even on the battlefield on july 26 , hooker was promoted to major general , to rank from may 5 during the second battle of bull run , the iii corps was sent to reinforce john pope 's army of virginia following second bull run , hooker replaced irvin mcdowell as commander of the army of virginia 's iii corps , soon redesignated the i corps of the army of the potomac during the maryland campaign , hooker led the i corps at south mountain and at antietam , his corps launched the first assault of the bloodiest day in american history , driving south into the corps of lt he asserted that the battle would have been a decisive union victory if he had managed to stay on the field , but general mcclellan 's caution once again failed the northern troops and lee 's much smaller army eluded destruction although hooker had criticized mcclellan persistently , the latter was apparently unaware of it and in early october , shortly before his termination , had recommended that hooker receive a promotion to brigadier general in the regular army this promotion ensured that he would remain a general after the war was over and not revert to the rank of captain or lieutenant colonel upon recovering from his foot wound , hooker was briefly made commander of v corps , but was then promoted to '' grand division '' command , with a command that consisted of both iii and v corps hooker derided burnside 's plan to assault the fortified heights behind the city , deeming them '' preposterous '' burnside followed up this battle with the humiliating mud march in january and hooker 's criticism of his commander bordered on formal insubordination lincoln appointed hooker to command of the army of the potomac on january 26 , 1863 lincoln wrote a letter to the newly appointed general , part of which stated , during the spring of 1863 , hooker established a reputation as an outstanding administrator and restored the morale of his soldiers , which had plummeted to a new low under burnside he created the bureau of military information , which was the first all-source intelligence organization employed by the u.s he also implemented corps badges as a means of identifying units during battle or when marching and to instill unit pride in the men the corps badge idea was suggested by hooker 's chief of staff , daniel butterfield ( sears , chancellorsville , p hooker said of his revived army : also during this winter hooker made several high-level command changes , including with his corps commanders franklin , who vowed that he would not serve under hooker , and ii corps commander maj dan butterfield for chief of staff , and the notorious political general , maj hooker 's plan for the spring and summer campaign was both elegant and promising unfortunately for hooker and the union , the execution of his plan did not match the elegance of the plan itself lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of hooker 's army then , he split again , sending stonewall jackson 's corps on its own flanking march , striking hooker 's exposed right flank and routing the union xi corps slocum , openly questioned hooker 's command decisions couch was so disgusted that he refused to ever serve under hooker again political winds blew strongly in the following weeks as generals maneuvered to overthrow hooker or to position themselves if lincoln decided on his own to do so some versions of the legend claim that the band of prostitutes that followed his division were derisively referred to as '' general hooker 's army '' or '' hooker 's brigade there is an equestrian statue of general hooker outside the massachusetts state house in boston , and hooker county in nebraska is named for him

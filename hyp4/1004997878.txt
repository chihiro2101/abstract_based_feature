born in hamburg , the son of a police constable , schmidt moved in 1928 , after the death of his father ( 1883-1928 ) , with his mother ( 1894-1973 ) , to her hometown of lauban ( in lusatia , then lower silesia , now poland ) and attended secondary school in görlitz as well as a trade school there at the outset of world war ii , in 1939 , schmidt was drafted into the wehrmacht , where his mathematical skills led him to be assigned to the artillery corps as the war was obviously lost , he used this visit to organise his wife 's and his own escape to the west of germany , in order to evade capture by the red army , which was known for its much harsher treatment of prisoners of war and german civilians since schmidt 's pre-war home in lauban was now under polish administration , schmidt and his wife were among the millions of refugees moved by the authorities to numerous places in what was to become west germany temporary accommodations led the schmidts to cordingen ( near bomlitz ) , gau-bickelheim , and kastel ( the latter two in the newly formed state of rhineland-palatinate ) his theory of etyms is developed in his masterpiece , zettels traum , in which an elderly writer comments on edgar allan poe 's works in a stream of consciousness , while discussing a poe translation with a couple of translators and flirting with their teenage daughter '' but schmidt 's reputation as esoteric , and that of his work as non-art , has faded and he is now seen as an important , if highly eccentric , german writer of the 20th century in the 1960s , he authored a series of plays for german radio stations presenting forgotten or little known and—in his opinion—vastly underrated authors , e.g as none of his works sold more than a few thousand copies ( schmidt openly admitted that he only wrote for the small handful of people who could appreciate his work ) , he lived in extreme poverty schmidt 's final completed novel was abend mit goldrand ( 1975 ) which was praised by some critics for its verbal inventiveness , although many had a difficult time digesting the erotic themes of the book the arno schmidt prize , awarded by the arno schmidt foundation and awarded from 1981 to 1988 , was endowed with dm 50,000 ( about €25,000 ) materialien zum werk arno schmidts , munich 1974 ( in german ) hans-michael bock : bibliografie arno schmidt 1949–1978 , munich 1979 ( in german ) karl-heinz müther : bibliographie arno schmidt 1949–1991 , bielefeld 1992 ( in german , continued ) wolfgang martynkewicz : arno schmidt kiel ( ludwig ) 2002 , ( in german ) » arno schmidt ? - allerdings ! « 2006 ( marbacher kataloge ) ( arno schmidt exhibition , marbach 2006 ) robert weninger : framing a novelist : arno schmidt criticism 1970–1994

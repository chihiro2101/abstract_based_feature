at the outset of world war ii , in 1939 , schmidt was drafted into the wehrmacht , where his mathematical skills led him to be assigned to the artillery corps as the war was obviously lost , he used this visit to organise his wife 's and his own escape to the west of germany , in order to evade capture by the red army , which was known for its much harsher treatment of prisoners of war and german civilians since schmidt 's pre-war home in lauban was now under polish administration , schmidt and his wife were among the millions of refugees moved by the authorities to numerous places in what was to become west germany in kastel , he was accused in court of blasphemy and moral subversion , then still considered a crime in some of the catholic regions of germany one of the most cited examples is the use of “ roh mann tick '' instead of '' romantik '' ( revealing romanticism as the craze of unsubtle men ) schmidt also accomplished a translation of edgar allan poe 's works himself ( 1966–1973 , together with hans wollschläger ) some critics even dismissed zettel 's traum as non-art , or sheer nonsense , and schmidt himself as a '' psychopath '' but schmidt 's reputation as esoteric , and that of his work as non-art , has faded and he is now seen as an important , if highly eccentric , german writer of the 20th century in the 1960s , he authored a series of plays for german radio stations presenting forgotten or little known and—in his opinion—vastly underrated authors , e.g schmidt 's final completed novel was abend mit goldrand ( 1975 ) which was praised by some critics for its verbal inventiveness , although many had a difficult time digesting the erotic themes of the book the arno schmidt prize , awarded by the arno schmidt foundation and awarded from 1981 to 1988 , was endowed with dm 50,000 ( about €25,000 ) kiel ( ludwig ) 2002 , ( in german ) » arno schmidt ? - allerdings ! « 2006 ( marbacher kataloge ) ( arno schmidt exhibition , marbach 2006 ) tony phelan : rationalist narrative in some works of arno schmidt gerhard charles rump , '' schmidt , joyce und die suprasegmentalien '' , in : interaktionsanalysen

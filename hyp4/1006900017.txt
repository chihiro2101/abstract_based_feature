traditionally , cam has been considered a numerical control ( nc ) programming tool , wherein two-dimensional ( 2-d ) or three-dimensional ( 3-d ) models of components are generated in cad as with other “ computer-aided ” technologies , cam does not eliminate the need for skilled professionals such as manufacturing engineers , nc programmers , or machinists cam leverages both the value of the most skilled manufacturing professionals through advanced productivity tools , while building the skills of new professionals through visualization , simulation and optimization tools a cam tool generally converts a model to a language the machine in question , typically g-code cam software would output code for the least capable machine , as each machine tool control added on to the standard g-code set for increased flexibility in some cases , such as improperly set up cam software or specific tools , the cnc machine required manual editing before the program will run properly none of these issues were so insurmountable that a thoughtful engineer or skilled machine operator could not overcome for prototyping or small production runs ; g-code is a simple language in high production or high precision shops , a different set of problems were encountered where an experienced cnc machinist must both hand-code programs and run cam software : today 's cam systems support the full range of machine tools including : turning , 5 axis machining , waterjet , laser / plasma cutting , and wire edm today ’ s cam user can easily generate streamlined tool paths , optimized tool axis tilt for higher feed rates , better tool life and surface finish , and ideal cutting depth in addition to programming cutting operations , modern cam softwares can additionally drive non-cutting operations such as machine tool probing : to ensure ease of use appropriate to user objectives , modern cam solutions are scalable from a stand-alone cam system to a fully integrated multi-cad 3d solution-set

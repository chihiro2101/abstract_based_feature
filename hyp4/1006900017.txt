traditionally , cam has been considered a numerical control ( nc ) programming tool , wherein two-dimensional ( 2-d ) or three-dimensional ( 3-d ) models of components are generated in cad as with other “ computer-aided ” technologies , cam does not eliminate the need for skilled professionals such as manufacturing engineers , nc programmers , or machinists cam leverages both the value of the most skilled manufacturing professionals through advanced productivity tools , while building the skills of new professionals through visualization , simulation and optimization tools a cam tool generally converts a model to a language the machine in question , typically g-code cam software would output code for the least capable machine , as each machine tool control added on to the standard g-code set for increased flexibility in some cases , such as improperly set up cam software or specific tools , the cnc machine required manual editing before the program will run properly the output from the cam software is usually a simple text file of g-code/m-codes , sometimes many thousands of commands long , that is then transferred to a machine tool using a direct numerical control ( dnc ) program or in modern controllers using a common usb storage device as cam software and machines become more complicated , the skills required of a machinist or machine operator advance to approach that of a computer programmer and engineer rather than eliminating the cnc machinist from the workforce the need for cam and plm tools by the manufacturing engineer , nc programmer or machinist is similar to the need for computer assistance by the pilot of modern aircraft systems : today 's cam systems support the full range of machine tools including : turning , 5 axis machining , waterjet , laser / plasma cutting , and wire edm : to ensure ease of use appropriate to user objectives , modern cam solutions are scalable from a stand-alone cam system to a fully integrated multi-cad 3d solution-set these solutions are created to meet the full needs of manufacturing personnel including part planning , shop documentation , resource management and data management and exchange

traditionally , cam has been considered a numerical control ( nc ) programming tool , wherein two-dimensional ( 2-d ) or three-dimensional ( 3-d ) models of components are generated in cad as with other “ computer-aided ” technologies , cam does not eliminate the need for skilled professionals such as manufacturing engineers , nc programmers , or machinists cam leverages both the value of the most skilled manufacturing professionals through advanced productivity tools , while building the skills of new professionals through visualization , simulation and optimization tools a cam tool generally converts a model to a language the machine in question , typically g-code historically , cam software was seen to have several shortcomings that necessitated an overly high level of involvement by skilled cnc machinists cam software would output code for the least capable machine , as each machine tool control added on to the standard g-code set for increased flexibility in some cases , such as improperly set up cam software or specific tools , the cnc machine required manual editing before the program will run properly in high production or high precision shops , a different set of problems were encountered where an experienced cnc machinist must both hand-code programs and run cam software users would select the type of tool , machining process and paths to be used in addition to programming cutting operations , modern cam softwares can additionally drive non-cutting operations such as machine tool probing : to ensure ease of use appropriate to user objectives , modern cam solutions are scalable from a stand-alone cam system to a fully integrated multi-cad 3d solution-set the semi-finishing pass must leave a small amount of material ( called the scallop ) so the tool can cut accurately , but not so little that the tool and material deflect away from the cutting surfaces

this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile throughout this period both the us and ussr were working on anti-ballistic missile systems developing an abm system was largely an engineering issue , requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour given that these items would be expensive , the abm interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an icbm ( or less ) , so any increase in the enemy 's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount the soviets were confirmed as working on an abm system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an icbm an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs with mirv , a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space , forcing the defender to use multiple abms to attack them a single new ballistic missile would demand multiple abms to counter it , this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the us that abms were infeasible although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this although polaris did have multiple warheads , they were not mirv - all three were released on the same trajectory and remained fairly close together during atmospheric entry although developments in the abm field had been watched throughout the 1960s , exactly what to do about the problem apparently remained a fairly low priority mirvs had so seriously upset the balance between abm and icbm that both parties agreed to limit abm deployment largely as a way of avoiding a massive buildup of new icbms the only good news for the uk in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing ; their attacks had to be able to credibly defeat a 100-interceptor abm defence around moscow this would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times , as well as larger crew complements , training and logistics support , and appeared to be the most expensive option among these were '' topsy '' , the a3t missile the uk had already agreed to use another option was antelope , which used hardened warheads along with penaids , although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids in this case a single resolution could launch up to 208 warheads , guaranteeing that some would get through this option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the us navy , as well as offering greater range , and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines this is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads ; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus '' declutter '' , allowing the warheads to be attacked this would require a much faster-reacting radar and computer system than an abm using a long-range interceptor , one that could safely wait until only a few moments before detonation , but this was by no means impossible and was part of the us 's own abm systems in the end the higher levels of the british political system decided against the urgings of their own chiefs of staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing a3t missile the name 'chevaline ' was the result of a telephone call to london zoo from an official at the ministry of defence the system was tested at the us eastern test range , cape canaveral , and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests – 'ugt 's – ( fallon ugt in 1974 and banon ugt in 1976 ) at the nevada test site there were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the rv/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the galosh warhead ; and there were numerous missile tests at the woomera missile range , australia , to develop various aspects of the rvs , the pac and decoys range of the '' improved '' chevaline system was 22 % less than the '' unimproved '' polaris a3t , reduced from to the chevaline solution was to decrease the number of warheads carried by the polaris system from three to two , using the space and weight to carry numerous decoys , and increase the likelihood of warhead survival by substituting a new super-hardened thermonuclear primary for the warhead contained in a new super-hardened rv given all sixteen missiles launching successfully , an abm system would be presented with 551 credible-looking targets to deal with the 'unimproved ' british polaris a3t carried three 200 kt warheads polaris missile - britannica online encyclopedia designated et.317 in u.s

that conclusion by successive british governments was the basis of their justification given to the british people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability this looked increasingly vulnerable in the face of ever-increasing soviet air defence forces , and various reports by the raf suggested their bombers would be incapable of successfully delivering free-fall ( '' gravity '' ) bombs by 1960 this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons among many possibilities , the raf eventually selected the blue steel standoff missile to allow its bombers to fire their weapons while still ( hopefully ) outside the range of the defensive fighters this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile finally a compromise was reached later that year ; the nassau agreement had the royal navy taking over the deterrent role with newly acquired polaris missiles developing an abm system was largely an engineering issue , requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour given that these items would be expensive , the abm interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an icbm ( or less ) , so any increase in the enemy 's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount the soviets were confirmed as working on an abm system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an icbm an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) with mirv , a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space , forcing the defender to use multiple abms to attack them although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this a single with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads , making it conceivable that many of them might be destroyed by even a small number of abms this meant the fleet could no longer guarantee the success of the deterrent 's objective – to threaten soviet state power something had to be done in order to maintain the relevance of the uk 's nuclear deterrent mirvs had so seriously upset the balance between abm and icbm that both parties agreed to limit abm deployment largely as a way of avoiding a massive buildup of new icbms the only good news for the uk in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing ; their attacks had to be able to credibly defeat a 100-interceptor abm defence around moscow one option would be to build additional polaris platforms and keep more of them at sea two resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration , while three would make it a certainty another option was antelope , which used hardened warheads along with penaids , although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids they also explored a '' superhardened '' version known as super antelope , a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead '' bus '' to deploy the penaids further apart in space this is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads ; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus '' declutter '' , allowing the warheads to be attacked in the end the higher levels of the british political system decided against the urgings of their own chiefs of staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing a3t missile the chevaline project was kept secret by successive uk governments , both labour and conservative shortly afterwards the thatcher government decided that the successor system should be the trident system and ordered the c4 variant the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t given that the abm treaty limited the ussr to 100 abm interceptors , a '' hit '' was virtually guaranteed chevaline – polaris slbm upgrade ( now dated obsolete inaccurate source ) polaris improvements and the chevaline programme

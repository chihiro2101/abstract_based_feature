that conclusion by successive british governments was the basis of their justification given to the british people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile in this case the missile had a projected range of just under 2,000 & nbsp ; km the distance from london to moscow is about 2,500 & nbsp ; km , so skybolt would allow the v-bomber force to attack russia from sites not far off the british coast , with complete impunity finally a compromise was reached later that year ; the nassau agreement had the royal navy taking over the deterrent role with newly acquired polaris missiles one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability developing an abm system was largely an engineering issue , requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour this was a game the us was clearly willing to play , although it would seem the ussr was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries ' respective economies the soviets were confirmed as working on an abm system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an icbm an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs a single new ballistic missile would demand multiple abms to counter it , this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the us that abms were infeasible although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this this meant that all three could be attacked by a single abm with a large warhead a single with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads , making it conceivable that many of them might be destroyed by even a small number of abms in 1967 the us offered a newer version of the polaris , the a3t design , which featured a '' hardened '' missile airframe intended to better protect it against abms mirvs had so seriously upset the balance between abm and icbm that both parties agreed to limit abm deployment largely as a way of avoiding a massive buildup of new icbms two resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration , while three would make it a certainty another option was antelope , which used hardened warheads along with penaids , although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids they also explored a '' superhardened '' version known as super antelope , a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead '' bus '' to deploy the penaids further apart in space this option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the us navy , as well as offering greater range , and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines this is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads ; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus '' declutter '' , allowing the warheads to be attacked some related options were explored , including '' option m '' which used a simple '' de-mirved '' bus , '' hybrid '' ( or '' stag '' ) which put the newer poseidon warheads on the existing polaris a3t missiles , and '' mini poseidon '' , a similar adaptation with a smaller six-poseidon-warhead payload on the a3t the thermonuclear ( or fusion ) secondary for chevaline and known to awre by the codename reggie , is known from these declassified documents to be recycled from the '' unimproved '' polaris a3t warhead in the end , the alternatives were '' between chevaline or nothing at all ; a decision which could easily have meant withdrawal of the uk from the military political nuclear scene '' and that option was unthinkable to the military staffs and government alike the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t the 'unimproved ' british polaris a3t carried three 200 kt warheads polaris missile - britannica online encyclopedia designated et.317 in u.s these warheads used the new harriet primary with reggie re-used from the et.317 warhead , public record office , london

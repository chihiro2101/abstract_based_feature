it was unrealistic to expect that the us second strike against the soviet union and risk an countervalue that conclusion by successive british governments was the basis of their justification given to the british people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability given that these items would be expensive , the abm interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an icbm ( or less ) , so any increase in the enemy 's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount the soviets were confirmed as working on an abm system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an icbm an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs with mirv , a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space , forcing the defender to use multiple abms to attack them a single new ballistic missile would demand multiple abms to counter it , this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the us that abms were infeasible although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this this meant that all three could be attacked by a single abm with a large warhead a single with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads , making it conceivable that many of them might be destroyed by even a small number of abms the only good news for the uk in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing ; their attacks had to be able to credibly defeat a 100-interceptor abm defence around moscow one option would be to build additional polaris platforms and keep more of them at sea two resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration , while three would make it a certainty another option was antelope , which used hardened warheads along with penaids , although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids they also explored a '' superhardened '' version known as super antelope , a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead '' bus '' to deploy the penaids further apart in space the royal navy preferred to upgrade to the ugm-73 poseidon , increasing the number of warheads from three per missile to between ten and thirteen of a newer and lighter design this option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the us navy , as well as offering greater range , and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines the us also favoured the poseidon , although for more technical reasons this is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads ; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus '' declutter '' , allowing the warheads to be attacked this would require a much faster-reacting radar and computer system than an abm using a long-range interceptor , one that could safely wait until only a few moments before detonation , but this was by no means impossible and was part of the us 's own abm systems as the uk had decided to produce its own warheads and bus , this option would require considerable development effort in order to produce a new mirv bus of their own in the end the higher levels of the british political system decided against the urgings of their own chiefs of staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing a3t missile the us later decided to move primary development from the c4 to the larger trident d5 , a much more capable missile , but one that would not fit into the latest s , let alone the older the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t tna prem 15-1359 which was developed in the uk and subsequently used on us warheads polaris improvements and the chevaline programme

that conclusion by successive british governments was the basis of their justification given to the british people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons among many possibilities , the raf eventually selected the blue steel standoff missile to allow its bombers to fire their weapons while still ( hopefully ) outside the range of the defensive fighters this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile the distance from london to moscow is about 2,500 & nbsp ; km , so skybolt would allow the v-bomber force to attack russia from sites not far off the british coast , with complete impunity one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability throughout this period both the us and ussr were working on anti-ballistic missile systems developing an abm system was largely an engineering issue , requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour given that these items would be expensive , the abm interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an icbm ( or less ) , so any increase in the enemy 's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount this was a game the us was clearly willing to play , although it would seem the ussr was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries ' respective economies an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs with mirv , a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space , forcing the defender to use multiple abms to attack them a single new ballistic missile would demand multiple abms to counter it , this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the us that abms were infeasible although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this this meant that all three could be attacked by a single abm with a large warhead this meant the fleet could no longer guarantee the success of the deterrent 's objective â€“ to threaten soviet state power in 1967 the us offered a newer version of the polaris , the a3t design , which featured a '' hardened '' missile airframe intended to better protect it against abms by this point the us and ussr had agreed in the abm treaty to deploy up to 100 abms at only two sites mirvs had so seriously upset the balance between abm and icbm that both parties agreed to limit abm deployment largely as a way of avoiding a massive buildup of new icbms the only good news for the uk in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing ; their attacks had to be able to credibly defeat a 100-interceptor abm defence around moscow another option was antelope , which used hardened warheads along with penaids , although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids they also explored a '' superhardened '' version known as super antelope , a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead '' bus '' to deploy the penaids further apart in space the royal navy preferred to upgrade to the ugm-73 poseidon , increasing the number of warheads from three per missile to between ten and thirteen of a newer and lighter design they felt that while the decoy approach was useful against near-term abms deployed by the ussr , that it was considerably less useful against '' point defence '' type interceptors there were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the rv/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the galosh warhead ; and there were numerous missile tests at the woomera missile range , australia , to develop various aspects of the rvs , the pac and decoys they agreed to a deal whereby the us and british combined missile stock is serviced at a single location at the us navy facility at kings bay , georgia , and from there missiles are issued to both us and british submarines the real meaning of the words : a very pedantic guide to british nuclear weapons codenames the integrated upgraded polaris system was known as a3tk and carried two warheads in upgraded british-designed rvs these warheads used the new harriet primary with reggie re-used from the et.317 warhead , public record office , london

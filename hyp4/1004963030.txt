this looked increasingly vulnerable in the face of ever-increasing soviet air defence forces , and various reports by the raf suggested their bombers would be incapable of successfully delivering free-fall ( '' gravity '' ) bombs by 1960 this had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the blue streak medium range ballistic missile , but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons this system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as blue steel ii , which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile a better solution came along in the form of the us 's agm-48 skybolt missile the us bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the british v bombers , and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion , with a long-range standoff missile finally a compromise was reached later that year ; the nassau agreement had the royal navy taking over the deterrent role with newly acquired polaris missiles one key part of the agreement was that the uk would develop their own warheads for the missiles , as the uk military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability throughout this period both the us and ussr were working on anti-ballistic missile systems this was a game the us was clearly willing to play , although it would seem the ussr was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries ' respective economies the soviets were confirmed as working on an abm system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an icbm an american response was to develop '' antelope '' , a system designed to overwhelm an abm defence with decoys , or penaids ( penetration aids ) in the end the us abandoned antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads , which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of mirvs with mirv , a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space , forcing the defender to use multiple abms to attack them a single new ballistic missile would demand multiple abms to counter it , this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the us that abms were infeasible although the polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines , this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the soviet defences & ndash ; especially if the soviets were convinced of this this meant that all three could be attacked by a single abm with a large warhead this meant the fleet could no longer guarantee the success of the deterrent 's objective â€“ to threaten soviet state power mirvs had so seriously upset the balance between abm and icbm that both parties agreed to limit abm deployment largely as a way of avoiding a massive buildup of new icbms two resolutions would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration , while three would make it a certainty this would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times , as well as larger crew complements , training and logistics support , and appeared to be the most expensive option another option was antelope , which used hardened warheads along with penaids , although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids they also explored a '' superhardened '' version known as super antelope , a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead '' bus '' to deploy the penaids further apart in space the royal navy preferred to upgrade to the ugm-73 poseidon , increasing the number of warheads from three per missile to between ten and thirteen of a newer and lighter design in this case a single resolution could launch up to 208 warheads , guaranteeing that some would get through this is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads ; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus '' declutter '' , allowing the warheads to be attacked this would require a much faster-reacting radar and computer system than an abm using a long-range interceptor , one that could safely wait until only a few moments before detonation , but this was by no means impossible and was part of the us 's own abm systems range of the '' improved '' chevaline system was 22 % less than the '' unimproved '' polaris a3t , reduced from to to keep the polaris missile in use in the uk meant that some production lines had to be re-opened at great cost to supply a very small force the system was not a mirving system because the target of both warheads was one location , about which the two warheads were spread , as in the earlier mrv system of polaris a3t these warheads used the new harriet primary with reggie re-used from the et.317 warhead , public record office , london

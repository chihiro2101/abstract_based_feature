image : london bus and telephone box on haymarket.jpg thumb an example of motion blur showing a london bus passing a telephone box in london when a camera creates an image , that image does not represent a single instant of time most often this exposure time is brief enough that the image captured by the camera appears to capture an instantaneous moment , but this is not always so , and a fast moving object or a longer exposure time may result in blurring artifacts which make this apparent in such an image , any object moving with respect to the camera will look blurred or smeared along the direction of relative motion because the effect is caused by the relative motion between the camera , and the objects and scene , motion blur may be manipulated by panning the camera to track those moving objects in computer animation this effect must be simulated as a virtual camera actually does capture a discrete moment in time this simulated motion blur is typically applied when either the camera or objects in the scene move rapidly without this simulated effect each frame shows a perfect instant in time ( analogous to a camera with an infinitely fast shutter ) , with zero motion blur if an object makes a trip at a linear speed along a path from 0 % to 100 % in four time periods , and if those time periods are considered frames , then the object would exhibit motion blur streaks in each frame that are 25 % of the path length motion lines in cel animation are drawn in the same direction as motion blur and perform much the same duty in 2d computer graphics , motion blur is an artistic filter that converts the digital image motion blur effect , tutorialsroom /bitmap photoshop - motion blur , tizag.com /raster image in order to simulate the effect this occurs with some video displays ( especially lcd ) that exhibits motion blur during fast motion improvements in the visual quality of modern post-process motion blur shaders as well as a tendency towards higher frame rates have lessened the visual detriment of undersampled motion blur effects to create the motion blur seen here , the shutter must be kept open for a relatively long time , making it necessary to reduce the amount of light coming through the lens

wigner begins his paper with the belief , common among those familiar with mathematics , that mathematical concepts have applicability far beyond the context in which they were originally developed originally used to model freely falling bodies on the surface of the earth , this law was extended on the basis of what wigner terms '' very scanty observations '' to describe the motion of the planets , where it '' has proved accurate beyond all reasonable expectations '' he concludes his paper with the same question with which he began : the miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve wigner 's work provided a fresh insight into both physics and the philosophy of mathematics , and has been fairly often cited in the academic literature on the philosophy of physics and of mathematics wigner also laid out the challenge of a cognitive approach to integrating the sciences : a much more difficult and confusing situation would arise if we could , some day , establish a theory of the phenomena of consciousness , or of biology , which would be as coherent and convincing as our present theories of the inanimate world he further proposed that arguments could be found that might put a heavy strain on our faith in our theories and on our belief in the reality of the concepts which we form these include richard hamming in computer science , arthur lesk in molecular biology , peter norvig in data mining , max tegmark in physics , ivor grattan-guinness in mathematics and vela velupillai in economics richard hamming , an applied mathematics and a founder of computer science , reflected on and extended wigner 's unreasonable effectiveness in 1980 , mulling over four '' partial explanations '' for it '' hence galileo would have concluded that '' falling bodies need not know anything if they all fall with the same velocity , unless interfered with by another force much of human experience does not fall under science or mathematics but under the value theory , including ethics , aesthetics , and political philosophy a different response , advocated by physicist max tegmark , is that physics is so successfully described by mathematics because mathematical universe hypothesis , isomorphic to a mathematical structure , and that we are simply uncovering this bit by bit in other words , our successful theories are not mathematics approximating physics , but mathematics approximating mathematics

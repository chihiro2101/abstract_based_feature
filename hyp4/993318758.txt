neander found in him the inspiration he needed , while schleiermacher found a congenial pupil ; one destined to propagate his views in a higher and more effective christian form before the end of that year , the events of the war of the fourth coalition forced neander to move to g√∂ttingen the impulse communicated by schleiermacher was confirmed by planck , and neander seems now to have realized that the original investigation of christian history was to form the great work of his life the fresh insight into the history of the church evinced by this work drew attention to its author , and even before he had terminated the first year of his academical labours at heidelberg , he was called to berlin , where he was appointed professor of theology in the year following his appointment he published a second monograph der heilige bernhard und sein zeitalter ( berlin , 1813 ) and then in 1818 his work on gnosticism ( genetische entwickelung der vornehmsten gnostischen systeme ) a still more extended and elaborate monograph than either of the preceding followed in 1822 , der heilige john chrysostom und die kirche besonders des orients in dessen zeitalter , and again , in 1824 another on tertullian ( antignostikus ) the first volume of his allgemeine geschichte der christlichen religion und kirche embracing the history of the first three centuries , made it appearance in 1825 this period in neander 's life assuredly had a profound effect on both his personal faith , and his attitude towards life in general the conversion of augustus neander from judaism to christianity was the single most important event in his life , and had a large impact upon both himself and his writing neander 's purity of motive , the strength of his conviction , his unselfish devotion to christianity , and his similar zeal for freedom from a life of legalism are all aspects of paul 's character that are reflected in the character of neander his general history of the christian religion and church ( allgemeine geschichte der christlichen religion und kirche ) remains the greatest monument of his genius

greg dulli ( vocals , rhythm guitar ) , rick mccollum ( lead guitar ) , john curley ( bass ) , and steve earle ( drums ) formed the band in cincinnati late in 1986 the afghan whigs had evolved out of dulli 's previous band , the black republicans , a band that curley later joined curley would introduce dulli to mccollum , a frequent jam partner who was famed on the local cincinnati scene for his innovative use of effects pedals mccollum and dulli would bond over their shared love of r & b , in fact the first song the afghan whigs ever rehearsed was a cover of the temptations ' '' psychedelic shack '' dulli later described the intent behind the afghan whigs was to exist as '' a cross between the band , the temptations , and neil young playing with crazy horse '' in the wake of the black republicans ' breakup , dulli had decamped to arizona , where he composed half the material for what would become afghan whigs ' debut album big top halloween ( 1988 ) , self-released on the band 's own ultrasuede label '' while only a thousand copies of big top halloween would be pressed initially , one of them managed to capture the attention of jonathan poneman , the co-founder of influential seattle-based indie label sub pop , which signed afghan whigs in 1989 initially , sub pop planned for the whigs to release only a one-off single , but that soon led to a full-blown record contract with the label upon signing to sub pop , the afghan whigs became the second non-pacific-northwestern u.s with the 1992 album congregation and a covers ep , uptown avondale , the band developed what would become their signature sound , blending soul with psychedelic sprawl and punk abandon videos for notable congregation songs like '' conjure me '' and '' turn on the water '' would receive airplay on mtv , which began to regularly cover the afghan whigs as a new band to watch building on the buzz that welcomed congregation , the afghan whigs soon signed to a major label , elektra records , following a bidding war that resulted in a contract so lucrative , it featured a clause that allowed for the funding of a dulli-scripted feature film that ultimately was never made for their major label debut , the afghan whigs ensconced themselves in ardent studios in memphis , where big star , bob dylan , led zeppelin , and zz top had recorded the lead vocals on '' my curse '' were sung not by dulli , but by singer marcy mays of scrawl â€“ allegedly because the lyrics documenting the violent dissolution of a relationship were so personal , dulli could n't sing it dulli also was the only musician other than dave grohl to appear on the debut album from foo fighters eventually work began on afghan whigs ' fifth full-length album , which would be called black love upon its release in 1996 during the live dates for 1965 , dulli got in an altercation with a stagehand following an austin , texas concert date and suffered a head injury that left him in a coma ; two months after dulli 's recovery , however , the group returned to the road dulli clarified in interviews that playing afghan whigs with curley on a 2010 solo tour and meeting with mccollum anew during that period directly led to plans of reforming for live performance the band released their eighth album , in spades , on may 5 , 2017 also , italian indie-rock band afterhours , who extensively toured the us between 2006 and 2011 , under the auspice of greg dulli , cites afghan whigs as their influence

prior to the introduction of the bulletin board system ( bbs ) , modems typically operated on direct-dial telephone lines that always began and ended with a known modem at each end when the remote modem answered , already set to '' answer '' mode , the telephone handset was switched off and communications continued until the caller manually disconnected another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command hayes communications introduced a solution in its 1981 smartmodem by using the existing data pins with no modification instead , the modem itself could be switched between one of two modes : data mode in which the modem sends the data to the remote modem command mode in which data is interpreted as commands to the local modem ( commands the local modem should execute ) to switch from data mode to command mode , sessions sent an escape sequence string of three plus signs ( '' +++ '' ) followed by a pause of about a second in actual use many of the commands automatically switched to the online mode after completion , and it is rare for a user to use the online command explicitly this had a major denial of service security implication in that it would lead to the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence '' +++ath0 '' in data mode the computer operating system would automatically try to reply the sender with the same payload , immediately disconnecting itself from the internet , as the modem would interpret the icmp packet 's data payload as a hayes command the hayes command set includes commands for various phone-line operations such as dialing and hanging-up it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software this re-inforced the use of the hayes versions of these commands slowly , a set of commands based heavily on the original hayes extended set using '' & '' commands became popular , and then universal the hayes command set can subdivide into four groups : basic command set & nbsp ; â€“ a capital character followed by a digit when in data mode , an escape sequence can return the modem to command mode gsm/3g modems typically support the etsi gsm 07.07/3gpp ts 27.007 at command set extensions , although how many commands are implemented varies

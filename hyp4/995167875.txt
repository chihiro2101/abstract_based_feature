the modems operated in either '' originate '' or '' answer '' modes , manually switching between two sets of frequencies for data transfer the computer industry needed a way to tell the modem what number to dial through software another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command instead , the modem itself could be switched between one of two modes : data mode in which the modem sends the data to the remote modem ( a modem in data mode treats everything it receives from the computer as data and sends it across the phone line ) command mode in which data is interpreted as commands to the local modem ( commands the local modem should execute ) to switch from data mode to command mode , sessions sent an escape sequence string of three plus signs ( '' +++ '' ) followed by a pause of about a second this had a major denial of service security implication in that it would lead to the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence '' +++ath0 '' in data mode the computer operating system would automatically try to reply the sender with the same payload , immediately disconnecting itself from the internet , as the modem would interpret the icmp packet 's data payload as a hayes command the hayes command set includes commands for various phone-line operations such as dialing and hanging-up it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the command set was copied largely verbatim , including the meaning of the registers , by almost all early 300 baud modem manufacturers , of which there were quite a few only one other command set has remained popular , the us robotics set from their popular line of modems the hayes command set can subdivide into four groups : basic command set & nbsp ; – a capital character followed by a digit register commands & nbsp ; – sr n where r is the number of the register to be changed , and n is the new value that is assigned when in data mode , an escape sequence can return the modem to command mode in this example , the user of computer a makes the modem dial the phone number of modem b at phone number 555-1234 ( long distance ) access point name ( apn ) command and data modes ( modem ) itu-t recommendations : h.324 ( video ) t.31 ( fax ) motorola phone at commands

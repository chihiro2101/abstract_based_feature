prior to the introduction of the bulletin board system ( bbs ) , modems typically operated on direct-dial telephone lines that always began and ended with a known modem at each end when the remote modem answered , already set to '' answer '' mode , the telephone handset was switched off and communications continued until the caller manually disconnected when automation was required , it was commonly only needed on the answer side & nbsp ; — for instance , a bank might need to take calls from a number of branch offices for end-of-day processing however , the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s led to the introduction of low-cost modems and the idea of a semi-dedicated point-to-point link was no longer appropriate another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command command mode in which data is interpreted as commands to the local modem ( commands the local modem should execute ) the hayes command set includes commands for various phone-line operations such as dialing and hanging-up it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the expansion to 1200 and 2400 baud required the addition of a small set of new commands , some of them prefixed with an ampersand ( '' & '' ) to denote those dedicated to new functionality frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software slowly , a set of commands based heavily on the original hayes extended set using '' & '' commands became popular , and then universal the following text lists part of the hayes command set , also called the at commands : '' at '' meaning 'attention ' each command string is prefixed with '' at '' , and a number of discrete commands can be concatenated after the '' at '' the hayes command set can subdivide into four groups : basic command set & nbsp ; – a capital character followed by a digit extended command set & nbsp ; – an '' & '' ( ampersand ) and a capital character followed by a digit proprietary command set & nbsp ; – usually starting either with a backslash ( “ \ ” ) or with a percent sign ( “ % ” ) ; these commands vary widely among modem manufacturers gsm/3g modems typically support the etsi gsm 07.07/3gpp ts 27.007 at command set extensions , although how many commands are implemented varies access point name ( apn ) command and data modes ( modem ) itu-t recommendations : h.324 ( video ) t.31 ( fax ) motorola phone at commands

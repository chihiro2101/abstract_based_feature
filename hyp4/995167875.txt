when the remote modem answered , already set to '' answer '' mode , the telephone handset was switched off and communications continued until the caller manually disconnected to fill this role , some modems included the ability to pick up the phone automatically when it was in answer mode , and clearing the line when the other user manually disconnected another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command instead , the modem itself could be switched between one of two modes : data mode in which the modem sends the data to the remote modem in actual use many of the commands automatically switched to the online mode after completion , and it is rare for a user to use the online command explicitly the hayes command set includes commands for various phone-line operations such as dialing and hanging-up it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the command set was copied largely verbatim , including the meaning of the registers , by almost all early 300 baud modem manufacturers , of which there were quite a few hayes itself was forced to quickly introduce a 2400 baud model shortly after their 1200 , and the command sets were identical as a time-saving method frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software this re-inforced the use of the hayes versions of these commands slowly , a set of commands based heavily on the original hayes extended set using '' & '' commands became popular , and then universal the following text lists part of the hayes command set , also called the at commands : '' at '' meaning 'attention ' when in data mode , an escape sequence can return the modem to command mode the following syntactical definitions apply : at commands reference guide carriage return character , is the command line and result code terminator character , which value , in decimal ascii between 0 and 255 , is specified in register s3 a string can contain many hayes commands placed together , so as to optimally prepare the modem to dial out or answer , e.g gsm/3g modems typically support the etsi gsm 07.07/3gpp ts 27.007 at command set extensions , although how many commands are implemented varies access point name ( apn ) command and data modes ( modem ) itu-t recommendations : h.324 ( video ) t.31 ( fax ) motorola phone at commands

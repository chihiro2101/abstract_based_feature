the computer industry needed a way to tell the modem what number to dial through software another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command command mode in which data is interpreted as commands to the local modem ( commands the local modem should execute ) to switch from data mode to command mode , sessions sent an escape sequence string of three plus signs ( '' +++ '' ) followed by a pause of about a second in actual use many of the commands automatically switched to the online mode after completion , and it is rare for a user to use the online command explicitly this had a major denial of service security implication in that it would lead to the modem hanging up the connection should the computer ever try to transmit the byte sequence '' +++ath0 '' in data mode the computer operating system would automatically try to reply the sender with the same payload , immediately disconnecting itself from the internet , as the modem would interpret the icmp packet 's data payload as a hayes command the hayes command set includes commands for various phone-line operations such as dialing and hanging-up it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the command set was copied largely verbatim , including the meaning of the registers , by almost all early 300 baud modem manufacturers , of which there were quite a few the expansion to 1200 and 2400 baud required the addition of a small set of new commands , some of them prefixed with an ampersand ( '' & '' ) to denote those dedicated to new functionality hayes itself was forced to quickly introduce a 2400 baud model shortly after their 1200 , and the command sets were identical as a time-saving method however , hayes communications were slow to release modems supporting higher speeds or compression , and three other companies led the way here & nbsp ; — microcom , u.s slowly , a set of commands based heavily on the original hayes extended set using '' & '' commands became popular , and then universal the following text lists part of the hayes command set , also called the at commands : '' at '' meaning 'attention ' the hayes command set can subdivide into four groups : basic command set & nbsp ; – a capital character followed by a digit when in data mode , an escape sequence can return the modem to command mode gsm/3g modems typically support the etsi gsm 07.07/3gpp ts 27.007 at command set extensions , although how many commands are implemented varies

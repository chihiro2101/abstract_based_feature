when the remote modem answered , already set to '' answer '' mode , the telephone handset was switched off and communications continued until the caller manually disconnected to fill this role , some modems included the ability to pick up the phone automatically when it was in answer mode , and clearing the line when the other user manually disconnected another solution would have been to use a separate set of '' command pins '' dedicated to sending and receiving commands , another could have used a signal pin indicating that the modem should interpret incoming data as a command command mode in which data is interpreted as commands to the local modem ( commands the local modem should execute ) to switch from data mode to command mode , sessions sent an escape sequence string of three plus signs ( '' +++ '' ) followed by a pause of about a second the same error would also trigger if , for example , the user of the computer ever tried to send an e-mail containing the aforementioned string it also includes various controls to set up the modem , including a set of register commands which allowed the user to directly set the various memory locations in the original hayes modem the command set was copied largely verbatim , including the meaning of the registers , by almost all early 300 baud modem manufacturers , of which there were quite a few the expansion to 1200 and 2400 baud required the addition of a small set of new commands , some of them prefixed with an ampersand ( '' & '' ) to denote those dedicated to new functionality frank durda iv , '' the at command set reference - history '' , 1993 essentially by accident , this allowed users of existing 1200 baud modems to use the new hayes 2400 models without changing their software however , hayes communications were slow to release modems supporting higher speeds or compression , and three other companies led the way here & nbsp ; — microcom , u.s by the early-1990s , there were four major command sets in use , and a number of versions based on one of these only one other command set has remained popular , the us robotics set from their popular line of modems the following text lists part of the hayes command set , also called the at commands : '' at '' meaning 'attention ' the hayes command set can subdivide into four groups : basic command set & nbsp ; – a capital character followed by a digit extended command set & nbsp ; – an '' & '' ( ampersand ) and a capital character followed by a digit this extends the basic command set gsm/3g modems typically support the etsi gsm 07.07/3gpp ts 27.007 at command set extensions , although how many commands are implemented varies

left left meg signals were first measured by university of illinois physicist david cohen in 1968 , before the availability of the squid , using a copper induction coil as the detector to reduce the magnetic background noise , the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use later , cohen built a much better shielded room at mit , and used one of the first squid detectors , just developed by james e at first , a single squid detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject 's head the brain 's magnetic field , measuring at 10 femtotesla ( ft ) for cortical activity and 10 3 ft for the human alpha rhythm , is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment , which is on the order of 10 8 ft or 0.1 μt the essential problem of biomagnetism is , thus , the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors , and to the competing environmental noise in accordance with maxwell 's equations , any electrical current will produce a magnetic field , and it is this field that is measured currents with a position , orientation , and magnitude , but no spatial extent since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other , it is often the layer of pyramidal cells , which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface , that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head , and these bundles are typically located in the sulci researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain ( i.e it is worth noting that action potentials do not usually produce an observable field , mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary a magnetically shielded room ( msr ) model consists of three nested main layers insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure ac eddy current shielding , which is important at frequencies greater than 1 & nbsp ; hz shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability , while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3 & nbsp ; ft/hz 0.5 above 1 & nbsp ; hz the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head problems such as this , where model parameters ( the location of the activity ) have to be estimated from measured data ( the squid signals ) are referred to as inverse problems ( in contrast to forward problems where the model parameters ( e.g possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity from meg and eeg signals that may be contaminated with outside noise the responses in the brain before , during , and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with eeg meg can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects , suggesting a future role of meg in diagnostics since the meg signal is a direct measure of neuronal activity , its temporal resolution is comparable with that of intracranial electrodes eeg is , therefore , sensitive to activity in more brain areas , but activity that is visible in meg can also be localized with more accuracy

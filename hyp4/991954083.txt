left left meg signals were first measured by university of illinois physicist david cohen in 1968 , before the availability of the squid , using a copper induction coil as the detector the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use zimmerman , a researcher at ford motor company , to again measure meg signals at first , a single squid detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject 's head this was cumbersome , and , in the 1980s , meg manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head present-day meg arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors , covering most of the head recent developments attempt to increase portability of meg scanners by using serf ( serf ) magnetometers neural synchronization induce weak magnetic fields 250pxthe meg ( and eeg ) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synapse transmission according to the right-hand rule , a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain ( i.e since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary a magnetically shielded room ( msr ) model consists of three nested main layers each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer , similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure ac eddy current shielding , which is important at frequencies greater than 1 & nbsp ; hz the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head problems such as this , where model parameters ( the location of the activity ) have to be estimated from measured data ( the squid signals ) are referred to as inverse problems ( in contrast to forward problems where the model parameters ( e.g ) the primary difficulty is that the inverse problem does not have a unique solution ( i.e possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator from meg and eeg signals that may be contaminated with outside noise meg is also being used to better localize responses in the brain psychologists are also taking advantage of meg neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior meg complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as electroencephalography ( eeg ) , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , and fmri eeg is , therefore , sensitive to activity in more brain areas , but activity that is visible in meg can also be localized with more accuracy meg detects intracellular currents associated primarily with these synaptic potentials because the field components generated by volume currents tend to cancel out in a spherical volume conductor

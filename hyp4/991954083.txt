to reduce the magnetic background noise , the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room zimmerman , a researcher at ford motor company , to again measure meg signals at first , a single squid detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject 's head present-day meg arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors , covering most of the head recent developments attempt to increase portability of meg scanners by using serf ( serf ) magnetometers in 2012 , it was demonstrated that meg could work with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer ( csam , type of serf ) the brain 's magnetic field , measuring at 10 femtotesla ( ft ) for cortical activity and 10 3 ft for the human alpha rhythm , is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment , which is on the order of 10 8 ft or 0.1 Î¼t in accordance with maxwell 's equations , any electrical current will produce a magnetic field , and it is this field that is measured currents with a position , orientation , and magnitude , but no spatial extent according to the right-hand rule , a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head , and these bundles are typically located in the sulci since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary appropriate magnetic shielding can be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise , respectively each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer , similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips the junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers to implement an active system , low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted at the center of each surface and oriented orthogonally to it moreover , noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity the responses in the brain before , during , and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with eeg meg is also being used to correlate standard psychological responses , such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension meg can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects , suggesting a future role of meg in diagnostics meg has been used to study cognitive processes such as vision , audition , and language processing in fetuses and newborns meg complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as electroencephalography ( eeg ) , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , and fmri magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp , which results in a better spatial resolution of the meg therefore , meg is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity , which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy

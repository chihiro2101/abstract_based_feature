left left meg signals were first measured by university of illinois physicist david cohen in 1968 , before the availability of the squid , using a copper induction coil as the detector the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use zimmerman , a researcher at ford motor company , to again measure meg signals subsequent to this , various types of spontaneous and evoked megs began to be measured at first , a single squid detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject 's head this was cumbersome , and , in the 1980s , meg manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head present-day meg arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors , covering most of the head recent developments attempt to increase portability of meg scanners by using serf ( serf ) magnetometers serf magnetometers are relatively small , as they do not require bulky cooling systems to operate in 2012 , it was demonstrated that meg could work with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer ( csam , type of serf ) more recently , in 2017 , researchers built a working prototype that uses serf magnetometers installed into portable individually 3d-printed helmets , which they noted in interviews could be replaced with something easier to use in future , such as a bike helmet 250pxthe meg ( and eeg ) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synapse transmission according to the right-hand rule , a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain ( i.e , non-cortical ) signal , but no clinically useful method is currently available it is worth noting that action potentials do not usually produce an observable field , mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated to implement an active system , low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted at the center of each surface and oriented orthogonally to it the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity a loop is started , in which a forward model is used to simulate the magnetic field that would result from the current guess for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks , meg is most often combined with fmri , as the methods complement each other meg is also being used to better localize responses in the brain the goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas scalp eeg can , therefore , detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri , whereas meg is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci the decay of magnetic fields as a function of distance is more pronounced than for electric fields finally , meg is reference-free , while scalp eeg relies on a reference that , when active , makes interpretation of the data difficult .

left left meg signals were first measured by university of illinois physicist david cohen in 1968 , before the availability of the squid , using a copper induction coil as the detector to reduce the magnetic background noise , the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use later , cohen built a much better shielded room at mit , and used one of the first squid detectors , just developed by james e zimmerman , a researcher at ford motor company , to again measure meg signals this was cumbersome , and , in the 1980s , meg manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head present-day meg arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors , covering most of the head recent developments attempt to increase portability of meg scanners by using serf ( serf ) magnetometers in 2012 , it was demonstrated that meg could work with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer ( csam , type of serf ) the brain 's magnetic field , measuring at 10 femtotesla ( ft ) for cortical activity and 10 3 ft for the human alpha rhythm , is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment , which is on the order of 10 8 ft or 0.1 Î¼t 250pxthe meg ( and eeg ) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synapse transmission according to the right-hand rule , a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain ( i.e since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary a magnetically shielded room ( msr ) model consists of three nested main layers each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer , similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure ac eddy current shielding , which is important at frequencies greater than 1 & nbsp ; hz this negatively feeds a dc amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability , while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity meg is also being used to better localize responses in the brain the responses in the brain before , during , and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with eeg the clinical uses of meg are in detecting and localizing pathological activity in patients with epilepsy , and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy scalp eeg can , therefore , detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri , whereas meg is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci eeg is , therefore , sensitive to activity in more brain areas , but activity that is visible in meg can also be localized with more accuracy therefore , meg is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity , which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy

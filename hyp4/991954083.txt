left left meg signals were first measured by university of illinois physicist david cohen in 1968 , before the availability of the squid , using a copper induction coil as the detector to reduce the magnetic background noise , the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room the coil detector was barely sensitive enough , resulting in poor , noisy meg measurements that were difficult to use later , cohen built a much better shielded room at mit , and used one of the first squid detectors , just developed by james e zimmerman , a researcher at ford motor company , to again measure meg signals subsequent to this , various types of spontaneous and evoked megs began to be measured at first , a single squid detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject 's head this was cumbersome , and , in the 1980s , meg manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head present-day meg arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors , covering most of the head recent developments attempt to increase portability of meg scanners by using serf ( serf ) magnetometers 250pxthe meg ( and eeg ) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synapse transmission according to the right-hand rule , a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head , and these bundles are typically located in the sulci researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain ( i.e since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas , shielding from external magnetic signals , including the earth 's magnetic field , is necessary appropriate magnetic shielding can be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise , respectively active systems are designed for three-dimensional noise cancellation modern systems have a noise floor of around 2â€“3 & nbsp ; ft/hz 0.5 above 1 & nbsp ; hz the challenge posed by meg is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity the source locations can be combined with magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) images to create magnetic source images ( msi ) however , when the magnetic source image corroborates other data , it can be of clinical utility in research , meg 's primary use is the measurement of time courses of activity meg is also being used to better localize responses in the brain meg can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects , suggesting a future role of meg in diagnostics although eeg and meg signals originate from the same neurophysiological processes , there are important differences eeg is , therefore , sensitive to activity in more brain areas , but activity that is visible in meg can also be localized with more accuracy

unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses when the ancestors of today 's moss started to spread on land 470 & nbsp ; million years ago , they absorbed co 2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on file : mossopolis.jpg dense moss colonies in a cool coastal forest file : mossforest.jpg a cool high altitude/latitude moss forest ; the forest floor is covered in moss , beneath conifers file : route 1 , between vik and kirkjubæjarklaustur - panoramio ( 7 ) jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland file : steinerne rinne bei obererasbach im altmühltal.jpg moss growing along the stream from a karst spring ; travetine deposits from the stream water and the moss overgrows it , forming this ridge , with the stream on top in most areas , mosses grow chiefly in moist , shaded areas , such as wooded areas and at the edges of streams , but they can grow anywhere in cool , humid , cloudy climates , and some species are adapted to sunny , seasonally dry areas like alpine rocks or stabilized sand dunes a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways such aquatic or semi-aquatic mosses can greatly exceed the normal range of lengths seen in terrestrial mosses however , naturalists feel that mosses grow on the damper side of trees and rocks for mosses that grow on tree branches , this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch in cool , humid , cloudy climates , all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally moist enough for moss growth in taiga , some species of moss play an important role in providing nitrogen for the ecosystem due to their relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria moss is thought to add a sense of calm , age , and stillness to a garden scene moss collections are quite often begun using samples transplanted from the wild in a water-retaining bag surfaces can also be prepared with acidic substances , including buttermilk , yogurt , urine , and gently puréed mixtures of moss samples , water and ericaceous compost in the cool , humid , cloudy pacific northwest , moss is sometimes allowed to grow naturally as a moss lawn , one that needs little or no mowing , fertilizing or watering landscapers in the seattle area sometimes collect boulders and downed logs growing mosses for installation in gardens and landscapes the moss garden was created by removing shrubby underbrush and herbaceous groundcovers , thinning trees , and allowing mosses to fill in naturally mosses are sometimes used in green roofs advantages of mosses over higher plants in green roofs include reduced weight loads , increased water absorption , no fertilizer requirements , and high drought tolerance since mosses do not have true roots , they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems decaying moss in the genus sphagnum is also the major component of peat , which is '' mined '' for use as a fuel , as a horticulture soil additive , and in smoking malt in the production of scotch whisky information , diagrams and photos moss grower 's handbook- 2.39mb , pdf file the british bryological society picture gallery of mosses world of mosses - watercolour paintings of moss by robert muma

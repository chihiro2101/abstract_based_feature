unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses mosses also appear to evolve 2–3 times slower than ferns , gymnosperms and angiosperms when the ancestors of today 's moss started to spread on land 470 & nbsp ; million years ago , they absorbed co 2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on these chemically altered rocks in turn reacted with the atmospheric co 2 and formed new carbonate rocks in the ocean through the weathering of calcium and magnesium ions from silicate rocks jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on , such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees , oaks over alders , or vice versa mosses are also found in cracks between paving stones in damp city streets , and on roofs examples would be rhytidiadelphus squarrosus , a garden weed in vancouver and seattle areas ; bryum argenteum , the cosmopolitan sidewalk moss , and ceratodon purpureus , red roof moss , another cosmopolitan species a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways such aquatic or semi-aquatic mosses can greatly exceed the normal range of lengths seen in terrestrial mosses individual plants or more long are common in sphagnum species for example wherever they occur , mosses require liquid water for at least part of the year to complete fertilisation many mosses can survive desiccation , sometimes for months , returning to life within a few hours of rehydration it is generally believed that in the northern hemisphere , the north side of trees and rocks will generally have more luxuriant moss growth on average than other sides however , naturalists feel that mosses grow on the damper side of trees and rocks in taiga , some species of moss play an important role in providing nitrogen for the ecosystem due to their relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain surfaces can also be prepared with acidic substances , including buttermilk , yogurt , urine , and gently puréed mixtures of moss samples , water and ericaceous compost since mosses do not have true roots , they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems with proper species selection for the local climate , mosses in green roofs require no irrigation once established and are low maintenance decaying moss in the genus sphagnum is also the major component of peat , which is '' mined '' for use as a fuel , as a horticulture soil additive , and in smoking malt in the production of scotch whisky native americans were one of the peoples to use sphagnum for diapers and napkins , which is still done in canada

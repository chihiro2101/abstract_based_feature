unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses these chemically altered rocks in turn reacted with the atmospheric co 2 and formed new carbonate rocks in the ocean through the weathering of calcium and magnesium ions from silicate rocks file : mossopolis.jpg dense moss colonies in a cool coastal forest file : mossforest.jpg a cool high altitude/latitude moss forest ; the forest floor is covered in moss , beneath conifers file : route 1 , between vik and kirkjubæjarklaustur - panoramio ( 7 ) jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland file : steinerne rinne bei obererasbach im altmühltal.jpg moss growing along the stream from a karst spring ; travetine deposits from the stream water and the moss overgrows it , forming this ridge , with the stream on top in most areas , mosses grow chiefly in moist , shaded areas , such as wooded areas and at the edges of streams , but they can grow anywhere in cool , humid , cloudy climates , and some species are adapted to sunny , seasonally dry areas like alpine rocks or stabilized sand dunes moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on , such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees , oaks over alders , or vice versa while mosses often grow on trees as epiphytes , they are never parasitic on the tree some species adapted to disturbed , sunny areas are well adapted to urban conditions and are commonly found in cities a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways such aquatic or semi-aquatic mosses can greatly exceed the normal range of lengths seen in terrestrial mosses for mosses that grow on tree branches , this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch in cool , humid , cloudy climates , all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally moist enough for moss growth moss is also used in bonsai to cover the soil and enhance the impression of age however , specific species of moss can be extremely difficult to maintain away from their natural sites with their unique requirements of combinations of light , humidity , substrate chemistry , shelter from wind , etc moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain surfaces can also be prepared with acidic substances , including buttermilk , yogurt , urine , and gently puréed mixtures of moss samples , water and ericaceous compost advantages of mosses over higher plants in green roofs include reduced weight loads , increased water absorption , no fertilizer requirements , and high drought tolerance mosses are also used on green walls in containerized nursery operations , coarse mineral materials such as sand , gravel , and rock chips are used as a fast-draining top dressing in plant containers to discourage moss growth traditionally , dried moss was used in some nordic countries and russia as an insulator between logs in log cabins , and tribes of the northeastern united states and southeastern canada used moss to fill chinks in wooden longhouses in rural uk , fontinalis antipyretica was traditionally used to extinguish fires as it could be found in substantial quantities in slow-moving rivers and the moss retained large volumes of water which helped extinguish the flames information , diagrams and photos moss grower 's handbook- 2.39mb , pdf file the british bryological society picture gallery of mosses world of mosses - watercolour paintings of moss by robert muma

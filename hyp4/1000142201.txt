unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses when the ancestors of today 's moss started to spread on land 470 & nbsp ; million years ago , they absorbed co 2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on these chemically altered rocks in turn reacted with the atmospheric co 2 and formed new carbonate rocks in the ocean through the weathering of calcium and magnesium ions from silicate rocks file : mossopolis.jpg dense moss colonies in a cool coastal forest file : mossforest.jpg a cool high altitude/latitude moss forest ; the forest floor is covered in moss , beneath conifers file : route 1 , between vik and kirkjubæjarklaustur - panoramio ( 7 ) jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on , such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees , oaks over alders , or vice versa while mosses often grow on trees as epiphytes , they are never parasitic on the tree mosses are also found in cracks between paving stones in damp city streets , and on roofs examples would be rhytidiadelphus squarrosus , a garden weed in vancouver and seattle areas ; bryum argenteum , the cosmopolitan sidewalk moss , and ceratodon purpureus , red roof moss , another cosmopolitan species a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways for mosses that grow on tree branches , this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch in cool , humid , cloudy climates , all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally moist enough for moss growth moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem moss collections are quite often begun using samples transplanted from the wild in a water-retaining bag moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain surfaces can also be prepared with acidic substances , including buttermilk , yogurt , urine , and gently puréed mixtures of moss samples , water and ericaceous compost in the cool , humid , cloudy pacific northwest , moss is sometimes allowed to grow naturally as a moss lawn , one that needs little or no mowing , fertilizing or watering the moss garden was created by removing shrubby underbrush and herbaceous groundcovers , thinning trees , and allowing mosses to fill in naturally since mosses do not have true roots , they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems in containerized nursery operations , coarse mineral materials such as sand , gravel , and rock chips are used as a fast-draining top dressing in plant containers to discourage moss growth the application of products containing ferrous sulfate or ferrous ammonium sulfate will kill moss ; these ingredients are typically in commercial moss control products and fertilizers traditionally , dried moss was used in some nordic countries and russia as an insulator between logs in log cabins , and tribes of the northeastern united states and southeastern canada used moss to fill chinks in wooden longhouses decaying moss in the genus sphagnum is also the major component of peat , which is '' mined '' for use as a fuel , as a horticulture soil additive , and in smoking malt in the production of scotch whisky

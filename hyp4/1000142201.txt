unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses mosses also appear to evolve 2–3 times slower than ferns , gymnosperms and angiosperms when the ancestors of today 's moss started to spread on land 470 & nbsp ; million years ago , they absorbed co 2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on these chemically altered rocks in turn reacted with the atmospheric co 2 and formed new carbonate rocks in the ocean through the weathering of calcium and magnesium ions from silicate rocks small organisms feeding on the nutrients created large areas without oxygen , which caused a mass extinction of marine species , while the levels of co 2 dropped all over the world , allowing the formation of ice caps on the poles file : mossopolis.jpg dense moss colonies in a cool coastal forest file : mossforest.jpg a cool high altitude/latitude moss forest ; the forest floor is covered in moss , beneath conifers file : route 1 , between vik and kirkjubæjarklaustur - panoramio ( 7 ) jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland file : steinerne rinne bei obererasbach im altmühltal.jpg moss growing along the stream from a karst spring ; travetine deposits from the stream water and the moss overgrows it , forming this ridge , with the stream on top moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on , such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees , oaks over alders , or vice versa while mosses often grow on trees as epiphytes , they are never parasitic on the tree examples would be rhytidiadelphus squarrosus , a garden weed in vancouver and seattle areas ; bryum argenteum , the cosmopolitan sidewalk moss , and ceratodon purpureus , red roof moss , another cosmopolitan species a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways such aquatic or semi-aquatic mosses can greatly exceed the normal range of lengths seen in terrestrial mosses for mosses that grow on tree branches , this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch in cool , humid , cloudy climates , all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally moist enough for moss growth each species of moss requires certain amounts of moisture and sunlight and thus will grow on certain sections of the same tree or rock moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain in the cool , humid , cloudy pacific northwest , moss is sometimes allowed to grow naturally as a moss lawn , one that needs little or no mowing , fertilizing or watering woodland gardens in many parts of the world can include a carpet of natural mosses sphagnum moss , generally the species s some sphagnum mosses can absorb up to 20 times their own weight in water information , diagrams and photos moss grower 's handbook- 2.39mb , pdf file the british bryological society picture gallery of mosses world of mosses - watercolour paintings of moss by robert muma

the fossil record of moss is sparse , due to their soft-walled and fragile nature unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the permian of antarctica and russia , and a case is put forwards for carboniferous mosses it has further been claimed that tube-like fossils from the silurian are the macerated remains of moss calyptræ mosses also appear to evolve 2–3 times slower than ferns , gymnosperms and angiosperms jpg moss colonizes a basalt flow , in iceland file : moss ( iceland ) 03.jpg moss growing along seeps and springs in newly deposited basaltic rock , iceland moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on , such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees , oaks over alders , or vice versa a few species are wholly aquatic , such as fontinalis antipyretica , common water moss ; and others such as sphagnum inhabit bogs , marshes and very slow-moving waterways wherever they occur , mosses require liquid water for at least part of the year to complete fertilisation it is generally believed that in the northern hemisphere , the north side of trees and rocks will generally have more luxuriant moss growth on average than other sides however , naturalists feel that mosses grow on the damper side of trees and rocks in some cases , such as sunny climates in temperate northern latitudes , this will be the shaded north side of the tree or rock for mosses that grow on tree branches , this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch in cool , humid , cloudy climates , all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally moist enough for moss growth there are mosses that preferentially grow on rocks and tree trunks of various chemistries moss releases the fixed nitrogen , along with other nutrients , into the soil '' upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events , '' making it available throughout the ecosystem moss is also used in bonsai to cover the soil and enhance the impression of age moss collections are quite often begun using samples transplanted from the wild in a water-retaining bag moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces ; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain materials which are porous and moisture retentive , such as brick , wood , and certain coarse concrete mixtures , are hospitable to moss the moss garden was created by removing shrubby underbrush and herbaceous groundcovers , thinning trees , and allowing mosses to fill in naturally since mosses do not have true roots , they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems sphagnum moss , generally the species s subnitens , is harvested while still growing and is dried out to be used in nurseries and horticulture as a plant growing medium

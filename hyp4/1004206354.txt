whether or not the irish free state would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced to the provisional parliament by president cosgrave the labour leader , thomas johnson , remarked : another reason put forward not to adopt a written constitution was that constitutional conventions between members of the british commonwealth were evolving and there was likely to be an imperial conference on the matter before long the labour leader also objected to the manner in which the provisional parliament was being described as a '' constituent assembly '' when in fact it was not acting of its '' free volition '' and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution furthermore , while the irish republic had a constitution , of sorts , in the form of the dáil constitution , this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional it was therefore the prevalent view that when , in 1921 , the british government agreed to the creation of a largely independent irish state , that a new constitution was needed on 31 march 1922 , an act of the united kingdom parliament called the irish free state ( agreement ) act 1922 was passed the act gave no power to the provisional parliament to enact a constitution for the irish free state in due course , '' the house of the parliament , '' provided for by that act , was elected and met on 9 september 1922 , and calling itself dáil éireann , proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the constitution of the irish free state shortly after the british evacuated their troops from dublin castle in january 1922 , michael collins set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent irish free state which would come into being in december 1922 after that process was completed , a bill entitled the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced into dáil éireann ( the third dáil ) in september 1922 , the dáil sitting as a '' constituent assembly '' '' the british parliament then passed the irish free state constitution act 1922 , which came into force on 5 december 1922 this act recited that the house of parliament constituted pursuant to the irish free state ( agreement ) act , 1922 , sitting as a constituent assembly for the settlement of the constitution of the irish free state , had passed the measure set forth in the schedule to the act , ( namely the constitution adopted by dáil éireann ) , which it then referred to as '' the constituent act '' under british constitutional legal theory , the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 held the force of law because of the enactment of the united kingdom 's irish free state constitution act 1922

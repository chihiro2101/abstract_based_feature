whether or not the irish free state would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced to the provisional parliament by president cosgrave the labour leader also objected to the manner in which the provisional parliament was being described as a '' constituent assembly '' when in fact it was not acting of its '' free volition '' and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution in the negotiations leading to the anglo-irish treaty the british government insisted that the new irish state must remain within the commonwealth and not be a republic it was therefore the prevalent view that when , in 1921 , the british government agreed to the creation of a largely independent irish state , that a new constitution was needed the anglo-irish treaty made a number of requirements of the new constitution the act gave no power to the provisional parliament to enact a constitution for the irish free state in due course , '' the house of the parliament , '' provided for by that act , was elected and met on 9 september 1922 , and calling itself dáil éireann , proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the constitution of the irish free state shortly after the british evacuated their troops from dublin castle in january 1922 , michael collins set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent irish free state which would come into being in december 1922 after that process was completed , a bill entitled the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced into dáil éireann ( the third dáil ) in september 1922 , the dáil sitting as a '' constituent assembly '' it then provided that the constituent act should be the constitution of the irish free state and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by his majesty in accordance with article 83 of the constitution referring to the constitution as a '' measure '' whereby the constitution appearing as the first schedule to the constituent act was declared to be the constitution of the irish free state , the royal proclamation went on to '' announce and proclaim that the constitution of the irish free state as the same was passed and adopted by the said constituent assembly has been passed and adopted by parliament '' the 6 december 1922 was the latest possible date allowed for by the anglo-irish treaty for the continued authority of the provisional government set up by the treaty pending '' the constitution of a parliament and government of the irish free state '' under british constitutional legal theory , the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 held the force of law because of the enactment of the united kingdom 's irish free state constitution act 1922

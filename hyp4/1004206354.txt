debate on whether a written constitution was required whether or not the irish free state would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced to the provisional parliament by president cosgrave the labour leader also objected to the manner in which the provisional parliament was being described as a '' constituent assembly '' when in fact it was not acting of its '' free volition '' and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution irish nationalists who fought the anglo-irish war believed themselves to be fighting on behalf of a newly formed state called the irish republic furthermore , while the irish republic had a constitution , of sorts , in the form of the dáil constitution , this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional it was therefore the prevalent view that when , in 1921 , the british government agreed to the creation of a largely independent irish state , that a new constitution was needed it also provided by for the election of a body to be called the '' house of the parliament '' , sometimes called the '' provisional parliament '' , to which the provisional government established under that act would be responsible the act gave no power to the provisional parliament to enact a constitution for the irish free state in due course , '' the house of the parliament , '' provided for by that act , was elected and met on 9 september 1922 , and calling itself dáil éireann , proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the constitution of the irish free state '' the british parliament then passed the irish free state constitution act 1922 , which came into force on 5 december 1922 it then provided that the constituent act should be the constitution of the irish free state and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by his majesty in accordance with article 83 of the constitution besides abolishing the oath of allegiance , a requirement of the anglo-irish treaty , the act also expressly repealed the provisions both of the constitution proper and of the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 that required compliance with the treaty however , under irish law the constitution '' derived its authority not from the act of the imperial parliament passed on the 5th december , 1922 , or from the proclamation made on the 6th december , 1922 , but from the act of dáil éireann sitting as a constituent assembly passed on the 25th october , 1922 ''

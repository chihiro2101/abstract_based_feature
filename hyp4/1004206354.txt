whether or not the irish free state would have a written constitution was the subject of some debate when the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) bill was introduced to the provisional parliament by president cosgrave the labour leader , thomas johnson , remarked : another reason put forward not to adopt a written constitution was that constitutional conventions between members of the british commonwealth were evolving and there was likely to be an imperial conference on the matter before long the labour leader also objected to the manner in which the provisional parliament was being described as a '' constituent assembly '' when in fact it was not acting of its '' free volition '' and thereby at liberty to adopt a constitution irish nationalists who fought the anglo-irish war believed themselves to be fighting on behalf of a newly formed state called the irish republic in the negotiations leading to the anglo-irish treaty the british government insisted that the new irish state must remain within the commonwealth and not be a republic furthermore , while the irish republic had a constitution , of sorts , in the form of the dáil constitution , this was a very brief document and had been intended to be only provisional among these were that : the new state would be called the irish free state and would be a dominion of the british commonwealth ; the king would be the head of state and would be represented by a governor general ; members of the oireachtas ( parliament ) would swear an oath of allegiance to the irish free state and declare their fidelity to the king the act gave no power to the provisional parliament to enact a constitution for the irish free state in due course , '' the house of the parliament , '' provided for by that act , was elected and met on 9 september 1922 , and calling itself dáil éireann , proceeded to sit as a constituent assembly for the settlement of what became the constitution of the irish free state it then provided that the constituent act should be the constitution of the irish free state and should come into operation on the same being proclaimed by his majesty in accordance with article 83 of the constitution referring to the constitution as a '' measure '' whereby the constitution appearing as the first schedule to the constituent act was declared to be the constitution of the irish free state , the royal proclamation went on to '' announce and proclaim that the constitution of the irish free state as the same was passed and adopted by the said constituent assembly has been passed and adopted by parliament '' under british constitutional legal theory , the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 held the force of law because of the enactment of the united kingdom 's irish free state constitution act 1922 the constitution of the irish free state ( saorstát éireann ) act 1922 consisted of only a short preamble and three short sections , but was a far longer document because , as noted above , it included as schedules the full text of both the constitution proper and the anglo-irish treaty

lay leaders in the oregon conference of the church of god , seventh day , a seventh-day-keeping adventist group that rejected the authority of ellen white and her teachings loma became persuaded the bible taught sabbath observance on saturday , the seventh day , one of the beliefs of that church as his business was struggling against larger competitors , armstrong had the time to take up this challenge he began what would become a lifelong habit of intensive , lengthy bible study sessions his studies on sabbath and evolution convinced him that his wife was right , and that the theory of evolution was false in 1931 armstrong became an ordained minister of the oregon conference of the church of god ( seventh day ) the existence and history of this church became a significant factor in armstrong 's later beliefs after his ordination , armstrong allied himself with two other rogue ministers by the names of andrew dugger and c dodd , both of which had composed a book called a history of the true religion , from 33 ad to date , in which they claimed that the new testament church of the first century had secretly descended through history and eventually became the sabbath-keeping church of god ( seventh day ) eventually , this led to dugger and dodd 's ouster and when they promised to make armstrong an apostle in their new church , the church of god ( seventh day ) , he joined with them after severing ties with the church of god ( seventh day ) as the result of doctrinal disputes , he began to teach a form of british israelism , which would later make up his book united states in prophecy these broadcasts eventually became known as the world tomorrow of the future worldwide church of god secondly , it will center around jerusalem.and thirdly , this war will end with the second coming of christ ! from his new contacts in los angeles , armstrong began to realize the potential for reaching a much larger audience he searched for a suitable location and chose pasadena , california , as being ideal as it was a conservative residential community during this time , armstrong also reflected on starting a college to aid the growing church , by teaching and training young men and women hence , in 1946 armstrong moved his headquarters from eugene to pasadena and on march 3 , 1946 , the radio church of god was officially incorporated within the state of california he purchased a lavish mansion on millionaires row just off of the rose parade route on orange grove boulevard , quickly acquired his own printing plant , and was broadcasting internationally in prime-time radio time slots during the 1950s and 1960s , the church continued to expand and the radio program was broadcast in england , australia , the philippines , latin america , and africa armstrong believed that god had exciting plans for mankind that would see the end of such warsâ€”though the message went far beyond an earthly utopia this belief , called british israelism , formed the central basis of the theology of the worldwide church of god armstrong recalled in a 1983 letter : '' i entertained him at dinner in my home in pasadena , and he spoke to the faculty and students of ambassador college the volume of literature requests for material written by armstrong continued to grow during the 1960s and 70s , and the literature was translated into several languages and distributed to a worldwide audience television stations , and 36 television outlets internationally , dwarfing televangelists jerry falwell , jimmy swaggart , oral roberts , and jim bakker by this time , garner ted armstrong , the son of herbert w after initially changing his behavior he returned , but these issues resurfaced , coupled with his challenging his father 's authority as pastor general , resulting in him being permanently '' disfellowshipped '' ( the church 's term for excommunication ) in 1978 in 1977 , armstrong , then in his 80s , married ramona martin , then 38 , a long-time member and church secretary who had a 15-year-old son from a previous marriage the armstrongs separated in 1982 , with herbert armstrong returning to live in pasadena full-time , and the marriage finally ended in divorce in 1984 during pre-trial proceedings in the divorce case , armstrong 's lawyers had sought to limit evidence of '' prior incestuous conduct with his daughter for many years , '' but his wife 's attorneys said '' it was crucial since the church leader alleged mrs he wrote that '' time may prove this to be the most important book written in almost 1,900 years '' and called it a '' synopsis of the bible in the most plain and understandable language '' it was more or less a compendium of theological concepts , as articulated by armstrong , which included the notion that god deliberately coded the bible '' so that it would not be understood until our modern time '' he spent his final days confined at his home on the college campus in pasadena , california , on south orange grove boulevard almost until his final days , there was uncertainty about who would succeed armstrong in the event of his death finally , armstrong opted to select the next pastor general personally armstrong told the church 's advisory council of elders of his decision to appoint evangelist-rank minister joseph w hoeh , a long-time church member and one of the first graduates of ambassador college , officiated at the graveside service , and tkach gave the closing prayer in the years after his death in 1986 , wcg leaders came to the conclusion that many of armstrong 's theological arguments were not biblical , causing the church to reject his teachings as '' aberrant '' and to completely rewrite its doctrines armstrong as having the church rank of '' apostle '' armstrong taught that god works only through '' one man at a time '' and that he was god 's selected representative on earth he believed that those who die as unbelievers prior to the return of christ , exist in a state of '' unconsciousness '' ( see soul sleep ) until after the 'millennium ' at the second resurrection , during which they will be offered the choice to submit to god 's government all those incorrigibly wicked , those who refuse to accept god 's government and laws being judged guilty of rebellion against god to rise in a third resurrection , & thrown into 'gehenna ' fire armstrong taught against fornication , masturbation , adultery , homosexuality and other practices he viewed as aberrations , authoring the book god speaks out on the 'new morality ( later retitled the missing dimension in sex ) on the subject he made the extraordinary claim that the gospel christ brought ( of the kingdom ) had '' not been proclaimed to the world '' for about 1,900 years '' until the first week in 1953 '' when he began preaching it again on radio luxembourg as the bible teaches that '' the body is the temple of god 's spirit , '' armstrong believed that it should therefore be kept in good health and presented in a manner glorifying to christ

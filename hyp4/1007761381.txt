according to hasan raza , after more than six decades of its formal/ informal existence , a consensus on the definition of islamic economics has not yet emerged some definitions that have been offered include : '' that branch of knowledge which helps to realize human well-being through an allocation and distribution of scarce resources that is in conformity with islamic teachings without unduly curbing individual freedom or creating continued macroeconomic and ecological imbalances '' ( umar chapra ) ( similarly , the '' study of human behavior with regard to acquiring and using resources for the satisfaction of necessities , needs , and other desires , '' but '' based on the assumptions '' of the islamic '' outlook on life and humanity '' paper presented at 7th international conference on islamic economics , king abdulaziz university , 1–3 april , jeddah p.30 wiwwie2013 : p.4 a discipline that goes beyond the practice of western economics—which seeks to make '' positive analysis '' and give an objective description of what is—to provide normative policy prescriptions of what ought to be and can be anas zarqa ) '' restatements of islamic economic teachings '' , using '' modern economic jargon '' ( ayatollah murtaza mutahhari ) an '' ideological construct '' developed by 20th century islamists ( by abul a'la maududi , ayatollah muhammad baqir al-sadr , abolhassan banisadr , etc ) taking basic prescriptions from sharia ( islamic law ) , and systematizing and conceptualizing them '' to construct a coherent and functional ensemble offering a middle ground between the two systems of the twentieth century , marxism and capitalism '' ( social scientist olivier roy ) zaman ( 2015 ) argues that confusion regarding appropriate definition of islamic economics have arose because of attempts to mix western economics concepts with islamic ideals , when the two are diametrically opposed to each other in many dimensions he proposes a definition based on purely islamic sources : '' islamic economics is the effort/struggle to implement the orders of allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives ( micro ) , in our communities ( meso ) , and at the level of ummah ( macro ) fiqh and islamic economics '' these concepts , like others in islamic law , came from study of the quran and hadith—or as one observer put it , were constructed on the basis of isolated prescriptions , anecdotes , examples , words of the prophet , all gathered together and systematized by commentators according to an inductive , casuistic method '' in addition to quran and hadith , sometimes other sources such as al-urf ( custom ) , or al-ijma ( consensus of the ulama ) are employed , to create laws that determine whether actions were haram , makruh , mubah , mustahabb and fard for muslims works of fiqh are typically divided into different '' books '' such as a book of iman , of salah , zakat , taqwa , hajj , but not ` economics ` or ` economy ` some brief works might contain almost nothing related to matters of property , sales , finance others do not gather questions on economic issues in one heading , the case in tawzih al-masa'il , a work of fatwa by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , who although a pioneer of political islam approached the subject of economy '' as the classical ulamas do the chapter on selling and buying ( kharid o forush ) comes after the one on pilgrimage and present economic questions as individual acts open to moral analysis : ` to lend without interest , on a note from the lender is among the good works that are particularly recommended in the verses of the quran and in the traditions ` '' ( source : ruhollah khomeini , tawzih al-masa'il , p.543 ) other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four '' quarters '' : islamic economics 4itofm2014 : p.8 typically worship ( al- ` ibadat ) , marriage and family law ( al-munakahat ) , criminal law ( jinayat ) , commercial transaction law ( muamalat ) kahf ) writes that mu'amalat is '' closely related '' to islamic economics islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.46 ( however even with the '' quarters '' division of fiqh topics mu'amalat would not include inheritance or wedding dower ( mahr ) ( which at least often comes under marriage and family law ) , or calculation of alms ( zakat , which comes under al- ` ibadat ) ) a number of scholars ( olivier roy , timur kuran , omar norman ) have noted the recentness of reflecting on economic issues in the islamic world , and the difference between economics the social science based on data , and islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth salman ahmed shaikh and monzer kahf insist on a clear distinction between the roles of fiqh and islamic economics , shaikh saying to be meritorious as a separate field of inquiry , islamic economics can not confine itself just to explaining and deducing laws in economic matters based on core principles wiwwie2013 : p.xv-xvi according to another contemporary writer salah el-sheikh , '' islamic economic principles '' ( what he calls a '' fiqhiconomic model '' ) utilize the faqīh ( islamic jurisprudence ) as supporting material , but are grounded upon the ethical teachings within the qu'rān ; islamic banking and finance one significant result of islamic economics ( and target of criticism ) is the creation of islamic banking and finance industry farooq ) argues that this unfortunate situation has arisen because the '' preoccupation '' among supporters of islamic economics that any and all interest on loans is riba and forbidden by islam , and because profit and loss sharing to interest bearing loans originally envisioned for islamic banking have not proven feasible '' the tort of injury and dissolution of marriage at the wife 's initiative

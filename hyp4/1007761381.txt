according to hasan raza , after more than six decades of its formal/ informal existence , a consensus on the definition of islamic economics has not yet emerged some definitions that have been offered include : '' that branch of knowledge which helps to realize human well-being through an allocation and distribution of scarce resources that is in conformity with islamic teachings without unduly curbing individual freedom or creating continued macroeconomic and ecological imbalances '' ( umar chapra ) ( similarly , the '' study of human behavior with regard to acquiring and using resources for the satisfaction of necessities , needs , and other desires , '' but '' based on the assumptions '' of the islamic '' outlook on life and humanity '' ( monzer kahf ) ) islamic economics

beyond the practice of western economics—which seeks to make '' positive analysis '' and give an objective description of what is—to provide normative policy prescriptions of what ought to be and can

because of attempts to mix western economics concepts with islamic ideals , when the two are diametrically opposed to each other in many dimensions he proposes a definition based on purely islamic sources : '' islamic economics is the effort/struggle to implement the orders of allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives ( micro ) , in our communities ( meso ) , and at the level of ummah ( macro ) riba— '' referred to as usury ( modern islamic economists reached consensus that riba is any kind of interest , rather than just usury ) '' is prohibited '' these concepts , like others in islamic law , came from study of the quran and hadith—or as one observer put it , were constructed on the basis of isolated prescriptions , anecdotes , examples , words of the prophet , all gathered together and systematized by commentators according to an inductive , casuistic method ` '' ( source : ruhollah khomeini , tawzih al-masa'il , p.543 ) other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four '' quarters '' : islamic economics 4itofm2014 : p.8 typically worship ( al- ` ibadat ) , marriage and family law ( al-munakahat ) , criminal law ( jinayat ) , commercial transaction law ( muamalat ) islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.46 ( however even with the '' quarters '' division of fiqh topics mu'amalat would not include inheritance or wedding dower ( mahr ) ( which at least often

of reflecting on economic issues in the islamic world , and the difference between economics the social science based on data , and islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth islamic economics

preoccupation '' among supporters of islamic economics that any and all interest on loans is riba and forbidden by islam , and because profit and loss sharing to interest bearing loans originally envisioned for islamic banking have not proven feasible : the islamic foundation , 1981 , p.124 ; zakat on the issue of zakat , one of the pillars of islam , m.a.khan also criticizes the conservatism of islamic economics , complaining that '' the insistence of muslim scholars in implementing it in the same form in which it was in vogue in the days of the prophet and the first four caliphs '' the

according to hasan raza , after more than six decades of its formal/ informal existence , a consensus on the definition of islamic economics has not yet emerged some definitions that have been offered include : '' that branch of knowledge which helps to realize human well-being through an allocation and distribution of scarce resources that is in conformity with islamic teachings without unduly curbing individual freedom or creating continued macroeconomic and ecological imbalances ( monzer kahf ) ) islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.25 '' the study of an paper presented at 7th international conference on islamic economics , king abdulaziz university , 1–3 april , jeddah ( what most of the knowledge content in the body of islamic economics amounts to according to economist muhammad akram khan ) wiwwie2013 : p.xv an ideology '' a revolutionary ideology '' to change '' the corrupt reality ) taking basic prescriptions from sharia ( islamic law ) , and systematizing and conceptualizing them '' to construct a coherent and functional ensemble offering a middle ground between the two systems of the twentieth century , marxism and capitalism he proposes a definition based on purely islamic sources : '' islamic economics is the effort/struggle to implement the orders of allah pertaining to economic affairs in our individual lives ( micro ) , in our communities ( meso ) , and at the level of ummah ( macro ) fiqh and islamic economics these included : zakat—the '' charitable taxing of certain assets , such as currency , gold , or harvest , with an eye to allocating these taxes to eight expenditures that are also explicitly defined in the quran , such as aid to those in need riba— '' referred to as usury ( modern islamic economists reached consensus that riba is any kind of interest , rather than just usury ) '' is prohibited '' these concepts , like others in islamic law , came from study of the quran and hadith—or as one observer put it , were constructed on the basis of isolated prescriptions , anecdotes , examples , words of the prophet , all gathered together and systematized by commentators according to an inductive , casuistic method works of fiqh are typically divided into different '' books '' such as a book of iman , of salah , zakat , taqwa , hajj , but not ` economics ` or ` economy ` some brief works might contain almost nothing related to matters of property , sales , finance others do not gather questions on economic issues in one heading , the case in tawzih al-masa'il , a work of fatwa by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini , who although a pioneer of political islam approached the subject of economy '' as the classical ulamas do the chapter on selling and buying ( kharid o forush ) comes after the one on pilgrimage and present economic questions as individual acts open to moral analysis : ` to lend without interest , on a note from the lender is among the good works that are particularly recommended in the verses of the quran and in the traditions ` '' ( source : ruhollah khomeini , tawzih al-masa'il , p.543 ) other works divided the subjects of fiqh into four '' quarters '' : islamic economics 4itofm2014 : p.8 typically worship ( al- ` ibadat ) , marriage and family law ( al-munakahat ) , criminal law ( jinayat ) , commercial transaction law ( muamalat ) islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.46 ( however even with the '' quarters '' division of fiqh topics mu'amalat would not include inheritance or wedding dower ( mahr ) ( which at least often comes under marriage and family law ) , or calculation of alms ( zakat , which comes under al- ` ibadat ) ) a number of scholars ( olivier roy , timur kuran , omar norman ) have noted the recentness of reflecting on economic issues in the islamic world , and the difference between economics the social science based on data , and islamic jurisprudence based on revealed truth salman ahmed shaikh and monzer kahf insist on a clear distinction between the roles of fiqh and islamic economics , shaikh saying to be meritorious as a separate field of inquiry , islamic economics can not confine itself just to explaining and deducing laws in economic matters based on core principles islamic economics mkrdmie2003 : p.49 according to economist muhammad akram khan the '' main plank '' of islamic economics is the '' theory of riba '' , while '' another landmark '' is zakat , a tax on wealth and income wiwwie2013 : p.xv-xvi according to another contemporary writer salah el-sheikh , '' islamic economic principles '' ( what he calls a '' fiqhiconomic model '' ) utilize the faqīh ( islamic jurisprudence ) as supporting material , but are grounded upon the ethical teachings within the qu'rān classical scholars in the muslim world did however , make valuable contributions to islamic thought on issues involving production , consumption , income , wealth , property , taxation , land ownership , etc 302–41 '' the discontents of islamic economic mortality '' by timur kuran

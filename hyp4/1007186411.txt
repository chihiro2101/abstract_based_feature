glanvill and king henry ii , attempted to mediate a dispute between the archbishop of canterbury , baldwin of forde , and the monks of the cathedral chapter their efforts were fruitless , and walter

to find new means of raising money through taxation the historian doris stenton wrote that the pipe rolls , or financial records , during walter 's time as justiciar '' give the impression of a country taxed to the limit '' 51 because of richard 's absence from england , walter was able to exercise more authority as justiciar than any of his predecessors combined with walter 's position as

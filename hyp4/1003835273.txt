the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach many blood vessels serve the esophagus , with blood supply varying along its course the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein this is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut , which all drain into the celiac nodes the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta the esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side the vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus when a corrosive substance , or a solid object is swallowed , it is most likely to lodge and damage one of these four points the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter these sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed the upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus the primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach it is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter , named from the adjacent part of the stomach , the cardia the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles in addition , sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves , with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk the gastro-esophageal junction ( also known as the esophagogastric junction ) is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach , at the lower end of the esophagus histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus , stomach , and intestines the innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches after food passes through the esophagus , it enters the stomach when food is being swallowed , the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx , preventing food from entering the trachea these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself sclerosis of the esophagus , such as with systemic sclerosis or in crest syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis a muscular ring , called the cardiac sphincter , connects the stomach to the esophagus the esophagus of snakes is remarkable for the distension it undergoes when swallowing prey in terms of the digestive system of gastropods , the mouth opens into an esophagus , which connects to the stomach because of torsion , which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development , the esophagus usually passes around the stomach , and opens into its back , furthest from the mouth

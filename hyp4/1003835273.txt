the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach many blood vessels serve the esophagus , with blood supply varying along its course the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein all these veins drain into the superior vena cava , with the exception of the left gastric vein , which is a branch of the portal vein the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta from the carina of trachea downwards , the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery , left main bronchus , and left atrium when a corrosive substance , or a solid object is swallowed , it is most likely to lodge and damage one of these four points these constrictions arise from particular structures that compress the esophagus the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach it is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter , named from the adjacent part of the stomach , the cardia dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal reflux , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough , can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease , with damage of the esophageal mucosa the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk the vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function , supplying the muscles of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles it may enhance the function of the vagus nerve , increasing peristalsis and glandular activity , and causing sphincter contraction the gastro-esophageal junction ( also known as the esophagogastric junction ) is the junction between the esophagus and the stomach , at the lower end of the esophagus histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach the epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover , and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food in many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin , representing a coarser diet there are two types of glands , with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa , and esophageal cardiac glands , similar to cardiac glands of the stomach , located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus the outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length , with the abdominal part being covered in serosa food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus the esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract when food is being swallowed , the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx , preventing food from entering the trachea this can cause difficult swallowing , called dysphagia , or painful swallowing , called odynophagia a muscular ring , called the cardiac sphincter , connects the stomach to the esophagus in many vertebrates , the esophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands in fish , the esophagus is often lined with columnar epithelium , and in amphibians , sharks and rays , the esophageal epithelium is ciliated , helping to wash food along , in addition to the action of muscular peristalsis

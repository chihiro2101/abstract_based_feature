the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach many blood vessels serve the esophagus , with blood supply varying along its course the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein from the carina of trachea downwards , the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery , left main bronchus , and left atrium the esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side the vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter these sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed the upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach it is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter , named from the adjacent part of the stomach , the cardia the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles in addition , sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves , with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk in many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin , representing a coarser diet the submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus , a network of neuron that is part of the enteric nervous system the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus the outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length , with the abdominal part being covered in serosa after food passes through the esophagus , it enters the stomach peristalsis contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself the stomach produces gastric acid , a strongly acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion constriction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters helps to prevent reflux ( backflow ) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus , protecting the esophageal mucosa other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as muc21 and muc22 the other main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of the esophagus other strictures may include esophageal webs ( which can also be congenital ) and damage to the esophagus by radiotherapy , corrosive ingestion , or eosinophilic esophagitis if cancer of the esophagus is being investigated , other methods , including a ct scan , may also be used by 1908 , an operation had been performed by voeckler to remove the esophagus , and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus , ( to control esophageal cancer ) , had been conducted the muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially , but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so

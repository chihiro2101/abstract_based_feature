the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system many blood vessels serve the esophagus , with blood supply varying along its course the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein all these veins drain into the superior vena cava , with the exception of the left gastric vein , which is a branch of the portal vein ; position the upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea , adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe , and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta the thoracic duct , which drains the majority of the body 's lymph , passes behind the esophagus , curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in the lower part of the esophagus , to lying behind the esophagus on the left in the upper esophagus the esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter these sphincters act to close the esophagus when food is not being swallowed the upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk it may enhance the function of the vagus nerve , increasing peristalsis and glandular activity , and causing sphincter contraction the epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover , and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food the submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus , a network of neuron that is part of the enteric nervous system the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both muscle is arranged in two layers : one in which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus , and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus the outermost layer of the esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length , with the abdominal part being covered in serosa this makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus , stomach , and intestines food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus peristalsis contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself along with peristalsis , the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes barrett 's esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer this can cause difficult swallowing , called dysphagia , or painful swallowing , called odynophagia diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain the esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus , in a procedure called an endoscopy a muscular ring , called the cardiac sphincter , connects the stomach to the esophagus the muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially , but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so

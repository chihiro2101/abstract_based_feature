the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach many blood vessels serve the esophagus , with blood supply varying along its course the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein all these veins drain into the superior vena cava , with the exception of the left gastric vein , which is a branch of the portal vein the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta from the carina of trachea downwards , the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery , left main bronchus , and left atrium the esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side the vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus the esophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings , known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter however , the lower esophageal sphincter is not an anatomical but rather a functional sphincter , meaning that it acts as a sphincter but does not have a distinct thickening like other sphincters the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach it is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter , named from the adjacent part of the stomach , the cardia the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk the vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function , supplying the muscles of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction the upper striated muscle , and upper esophageal sphincter , are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus , whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach the human esophagus has a mucous membrane consisting of a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin , a smooth lamina propria , and a muscularis mucosae the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus the esophagus develops as part of the foregut tube food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus at the same time , the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes , allowing a bolus of food to enter peristalsis contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus the acute angle of his and the lower crura of the diaphragm also help this sphincteric action about 20,000 protein-coding genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70 % of these genes are expressed in the normal esophagus other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as muc21 and muc22 esophagitis can cause odynophagia and is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing reflux or treating infection prolonged esophagitis , particularly from gastric reflux , is one factor thought to play a role in the development of barrett 's esophagus in this condition , there is metaplasia of the lining of the lower esophagus , which changes from stratified squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia barrett 's esophagus is thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer the esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus , in a procedure called an endoscopy the esophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer from the condition known as choke the muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially , but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so

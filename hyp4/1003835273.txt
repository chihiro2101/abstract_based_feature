the esophagus is one of the upper parts of the digestive system it begins at the back of the mouth , passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum , through the diaphragm , and into the stomach the esophagus is usually about 25 & nbsp ; cm ( 10 & nbsp ; in ) in length the venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus the upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins , and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein ; position the upper esophagus lies at the back of the mediastinum behind the trachea , adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe , and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column the lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta from the carina of trachea downwards , the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery , left main bronchus , and left atrium the esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side the vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus ; constrictions the esophagus has four points of constriction when a corrosive substance , or a solid object is swallowed , it is most likely to lodge and damage one of these four points the upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter , which is formed by lower portion of inferior pharyngeal constrictor , also known as cricopharyngeal sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly the upper esophageal sphincter surrounds the upper part of the esophagus opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex the primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor the lower esophageal sphincter , or gastroesophageal sphincter , surrounds the lower part of the esophagus at the junction between the esophagus and the stomach the esophagus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk it may enhance the function of the vagus nerve , increasing peristalsis and glandular activity , and causing sphincter contraction histological examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach in many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin , representing a coarser diet the submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus , a network of neuron that is part of the enteric nervous system the muscular layer of the esophagus has two types of muscle the upper third of the esophagus contains striated muscle , the lower third contains smooth muscle , and the middle third contains a mixture of both these are separated by the myenteric plexus , a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus in early embryogenesis , the esophagus develops from the endodermal primitive gut tube sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus , stomach , and intestines the esophagus develops as part of the foregut tube peristalsis contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus these rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth , and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself these blood vessels are engorged more than normal , and in the worst cases may partially obstruct the esophagus a surgeon may also try to use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound sclerosis of the esophagus , such as with systemic sclerosis or in crest syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis the muscle of the esophagus in many mammals is striated initially , but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so because of torsion , which is the rotation of the main body of the animal during larval development , the esophagus usually passes around the stomach , and opens into its back , furthest from the mouth

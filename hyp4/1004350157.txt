the r-7 was long , in diameter and weighed ; it had two stages , powered by rocket engines using liquid oxygen ( lox ) and kerosene and capable of delivering its payload up to , with an accuracy ( cep ) of around the initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage , with a central 'sustainer ' engine powering through both the first and the second stage each strap-on booster included two vernier thrusters and the core stage included four following first ground tests in late 1953 the initial design was heavily reworked and the final design was not approved until may 1954 and korolev reportedly reviewed more than 100 design proposals for the first time the development of the project was created a separate volume dedicated to the testing of missile technology the design team had to develop a system to regulate the propellant component consumption ratio and to synchronize the consumption between the boosters starting from the r-1 , which was a copy of the german v-2 , a free-standing missile was launched from a horizontal pad the launch system simulated flight conditions with strap-on boosters pushing the central core forward the r-7 rocket was another soviet attempt to build a successful rocket to get to space the dummy warhead impacted in the pacific ocean and five days later , tass announced that the soviet union had '' successfully tested a multi-stage intercontinental ballistic missile '' aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes ; r-7 semyorka : first launch 15 may 1957 , last launch 27 february 1961 ; 27 launch attempts , 18 of which were successful ; r-7a semyorka : first launch 23 december 1959 , last launch 25 july 1967 ; 21 launch attempts , 18 of which were successful

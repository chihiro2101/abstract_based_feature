the initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage , with a central 'sustainer ' engine powering through both the first and the second stage each strap-on booster included two vernier thrusters and the core stage included four following first ground tests in late 1953 the initial design was heavily reworked and the final design was not approved until may 1954 and korolev reportedly reviewed more than 100 design proposals for the first time the development of the project was created a separate volume dedicated to the testing of missile technology starting from the r-1 , which was a copy of the german v-2 , a free-standing missile was launched from a horizontal pad the launch system simulated flight conditions with strap-on boosters pushing the central core forward the r-7 rocket was another soviet attempt to build a successful rocket to get to space the new missile 's grau index was 8k71 a modified version of the missile ( 8k71ps ) placed sputnik 1 in orbit from baikonur on 4 october 1957 and sputnik 2 on 3 november 1957 aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes the costs of the system were high , mostly due to the difficulty of constructing in remote areas the large launch sites required ; ss-6 sapwood : nato reporting name for all versions of the r-7 , variants identified by suffix letter on the name portion ( e.g ; r-7a semyorka : first launch 23 december 1959 , last launch 25 july 1967 ; 21 launch attempts , 18 of which were successful

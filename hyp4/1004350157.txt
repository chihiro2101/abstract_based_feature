the initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage , with a central 'sustainer ' engine powering through both the first and the second stage following first ground tests in late 1953 the initial design was heavily reworked and the final design was not approved until may 1954 and korolev reportedly reviewed more than 100 design proposals for the first time the development of the project was created a separate volume dedicated to the testing of missile technology starting from the r-1 , which was a copy of the german v-2 , a free-standing missile was launched from a horizontal pad the solution was to eliminate the pad and to suspend the entire rocket in the trusses that bear both vertical weight load as well as horizontal wind forces the launch system simulated flight conditions with strap-on boosters pushing the central core forward the r-7 rocket was another soviet attempt to build a successful rocket to get to space powering the vernier capabilities for the rocket was the rd-107 engine the next attempt on 11 june ( the same day the united states conducted its first test launch of an icbm ) , an electrical short caused the missile to start rolling uncontrollably and disintegrate 33 seconds after liftoff the next icbm test took place on 30 january 1958 , but the strap-ons failed to separate cleanly and damaged plumbing in the core stage , which lost thrust and impacted far off target aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes ; r-7 semyorka : first launch 15 may 1957 , last launch 27 february 1961 ; 27 launch attempts , 18 of which were successful korolev rocket and space corporation energia , a russian rocket and space contractor the r-7 missile , history of its development socio-educational portal « workers of the cosmos »

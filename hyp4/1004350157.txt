the r-7 was long , in diameter and weighed ; it had two stages , powered by rocket engines using liquid oxygen ( lox ) and kerosene and capable of delivering its payload up to , with an accuracy ( cep ) of around the initial launch was boosted by four strap-on liquid rocket boosters making up the first stage , with a central 'sustainer ' engine powering through both the first and the second stage each strap-on booster included two vernier thrusters and the core stage included four following first ground tests in late 1953 the initial design was heavily reworked and the final design was not approved until may 1954 and korolev reportedly reviewed more than 100 design proposals the r-7 rocket was another soviet attempt to build a successful rocket to get to space a modified version of the missile ( 8k71ps ) placed sputnik 1 in orbit from baikonur on 4 october 1957 and sputnik 2 on 3 november 1957 aside from the initial sputnik launches , the 8k71 formed the basis of the 8k72 booster used for the first generation luna probes combined with the failed sputnik launch on 27 april 1958 , this brought the booster 's total space launch record to 6 successes in 13 attempts on 15 december 1959 the r-7 missile was tested at plesetsk for the first time a single launch pad was operational at baikonur and from six to eight were in operation at plesetsk additionally , the huge payload for which it was designed , adapted to early heavy h-bombs , became irrelevant with the coming of lighter bomb technology ; r-7 semyorka : first launch 15 may 1957 , last launch 27 february 1961 ; 27 launch attempts , 18 of which were successful korolev rocket and space corporation energia , a russian rocket and space contractor the r-7 missile , history of its development socio-educational portal « workers of the cosmos »

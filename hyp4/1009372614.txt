johnny pacheco founded the fania record label in the 1960s and gave the name '' salsa '' to a blend of different influences , rhythms and styles of latin music in new york city , especially in el barrio , spanish harlem , and the bronx the dance evolved from forms such as son , son montuno , cha cha cha , mambo and pachanga which were popular in the caribbean , latin america and the latino communities in new york since the 1940s different regions of latin america and the united states have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as cuban , colombian , new york style & la style still , others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles , just like salsa or '' sauce '' in latin american countries is a mixture of different ingredients in many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes in the original latin american form , the forward/backward motion of salsa is done in diagonal or sideways with the 3-step weight change intact in some styles of salsa , such as the new york style , the dancers remain mostly in front of one another ( switching places ) , while in latin american styles , such as cuban style , the dancers circle around each other , sometimes in 3 points characteristics that may identify a style include : timing , basic steps , foot patterns , body movement , turns and figures , attitude , dance influences and the way that partners hold each other the point in a musical bar music where a slightly larger step is taken ( the break step ) and the direction the step moves can often be used to identify a style salsa dance socials are commonly held in night clubs , bars , ballrooms , restaurants , and outside , especially if part of an outdoor festival festivals are held annually , often called a salsa congress , in various host cities aimed to attract variety of salsa dancers from other cities and countries the events bring dancers together to share their passion for the dance , build community , and to share moves and tips with each other these events usually include salsa dance performers , live salsa music , workshops , open dancing , and contests every salsa composition involves complex afro-cuban percussion based around the clave rhythm ( which has four types ) , though there can be moments when the clave is hidden for a while , often when quoting charanga , changüí and bomba the key instrument that provides the core groove of a salsa song is the clave however it is taboo to play or dance to the wrong type of clave rhythm ( see salsa music ) as an example of how a clave fits within the 8 beats of a salsa dance , the beats of the 2-3 son clave are played on the counts of 2 , 3 , 5 , the '' and '' of 6 , and 8 the cowbell rhythm emphasizes the '' on-beats '' of salsa : 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 while the conga rhythm emphasizes the '' off-beats '' of the music : 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 its most basic pattern is played on the beats 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 the basic salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music the odd number of steps creates the inherent syncopation to the salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps new modern salsa styles are associated and named to the original geographic areas that developed them unlike other styles of salsa , new york style is danced on the second beat of the music ( '' on 2 '' ) , and the follower , not the leader , steps forward on the first measure of the music the etiquette of new york style is strict about remaining in the close dance space , and avoiding dancing in a sandbox area with many spins , turns and styling secondary evolution during the late 1970s , latin puerto rican migrants , contributed a lot to the new york salsa development during the '' nuyorican '' era of héctor lavoe which greatly popularized salsa and modern latin music throughout the world these two developments create a fusion of a new salsa music and dance genre , different from its latin american and caribbean counterparts new york style salsa emphasizes harmony with the percussive instruments in salsa music , such as the congas , timbales , and clave , since many or all of those instruments often mark the second beat in the music

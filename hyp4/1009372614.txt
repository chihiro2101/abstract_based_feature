johnny pacheco founded the fania record label in the 1960s and gave the name '' salsa '' to a blend of different influences , rhythms and styles of latin music in new york city , especially in el barrio , spanish harlem , and the bronx salsa means '' sauce which represented son , guaguanco , son montuno , cha cha cha , and latin jazz the dance evolved from forms such as son , son montuno , cha cha cha , mambo and pachanga which were popular in the caribbean , latin america and the latino communities in new york since the 1940s different regions of latin america and the united states have distinct salsa styles of their own , such as cuban , colombian , new york style & la style others believe that the term was created by record labels to better market their music , who chose the word '' salsa '' because of its spicy and hot connotations still , others believe the term came about because salsa dancing and music is a mixture of different styles , just like salsa or '' sauce '' in latin american countries is a mixture of different ingredients in many styles of salsa dancing , as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping , the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes in some styles of salsa , such as the new york style , the dancers remain mostly in front of one another ( switching places ) , while in latin american styles , such as cuban style , the dancers circle around each other , sometimes in 3 points salsa dancing is an international dance that can be found in most metropolitan cities in the world these events usually include salsa dance performers , live salsa music , workshops , open dancing , and contests salsa generally uses music suitable for dancing ranges from about 150 bpm ( beats per minute ) to around 250 bpm , although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220 bpm every salsa composition involves complex afro-cuban percussion based around the clave rhythm ( which has four types ) , though there can be moments when the clave is hidden for a while , often when quoting charanga , changüí and bomba it is often played with two wooden sticks ( called clave ) that are hit together most salsa music is played with one of the son claves , though a rumba clave is occasionally used , especially during rumba sections of some songs there are other aspects outside the clave that help define salsa rhythm : the cowbell , the montuno rhythm and the tumbao rhythm some dancers like to use the strong sound of the cowbell to stay on the salsa rhythm tumbao is the name of the rhythm that is played with the conga drums the beats 2 and 6 are emphasized when dancing on2 , and the tumbao rhythm heavily emphasizes those beats as well the basic salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music the odd number of steps creates the inherent syncopation to the salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps salsa 's roots are based on different cuban genres such as cuban son , specifically to the beat of son montuno in the 1920s new modern salsa styles are associated and named to the original geographic areas that developed them cali is also known as the '' capital de la salsa '' ( salsa 's capital ) ; due to salsa music being the main genre in parties , nightclubs and festivals in the 21st century the los angeles salsa style ( la style ) is danced strictly on 1 , in a slot \ line , using elements of various north american and stage dances the etiquette of new york style is strict about remaining in the close dance space , and avoiding dancing in a sandbox area with many spins , turns and styling puerto rican salsa superstars were the most important musicians during the era , such as ray baretto ( '' the godfather '' ) and many others palladium ballroom – a new york city venue that helped popularize latin music and dance during the 1940s and 1950s rhumba – a ballroom dance that heavily influenced salsa salsa music world salsa championships cuban salsa

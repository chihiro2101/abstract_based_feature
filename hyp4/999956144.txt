schütz was born in köstritz , the eldest son of christoph schütz and euphrosyne bieger while schütz was living with his parents , his musical talents were discovered by landgrave moritz von hessen-kassel in 1598 during an overnight stay in christoph schütz 's inn upon hearing young heinrich sing , the landgrave requested that his parents allow the boy to be sent to his noble court for further education and instruction his parents initially resisted the offer , but after much correspondence they eventually took heinrich to the landgrave 's seat at kassel in august 1599 after a prolonged yet polite negotiation between the landgrave and the elector , schütz moved to dresden in 1615 to work as court composer to the elector of saxony his dresden compositions during the thirty years ' war were , by necessity of the times , smaller scale than the oft-massive works before , although this period produced much of his most charming music after the war , schütz again wrote larger-scale compositions culminating in the 1660s , when he composed the greatest passionmusic before bach schütz moved back to weißenfels , in a retirement he had to beg for , to live with his sister ( the house is now a fine museum of his life ) , but the electoral court often called him back to dresden schütz 's music , while starting off in the most progressive styles early in his career , eventually grew into a style that is simple and almost austere , culminating with his late passion settings the style of the north german organ school derives largely from schütz ( as well as from the dutchman jan pieterszoon sweelinck ) ; a century later this music was to culminate in the work of j.s after bach , the most important composers to be influenced by schütz were anton webern and brahms , who were known to have studied his works in schütz research literature , regarded as inauthentic and not portraying heinrich schütz ( psalm 119 , psalm 100 , and german magnificat : '' swan song '' ) ( opus ultimum , dresden , 1671 )

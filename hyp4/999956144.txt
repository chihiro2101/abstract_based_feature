schütz was born in köstritz , the eldest son of christoph schütz and euphrosyne bieger while schütz was living with his parents , his musical talents were discovered by landgrave moritz von hessen-kassel in 1598 during an overnight stay in christoph schütz 's inn upon hearing young heinrich sing , the landgrave requested that his parents allow the boy to be sent to his noble court for further education and instruction his parents initially resisted the offer , but after much correspondence they eventually took heinrich to the landgrave 's seat at kassel in august 1599 after being a choir-boy he went on to study law at marburg before going to venice from 1609–1612 to study music with giovanni gabrieli after a prolonged yet polite negotiation between the landgrave and the elector , schütz moved to dresden in 1615 to work as court composer to the elector of saxony in dresden schütz sowed the seeds of what is now the sächsische staatskapelle dresden , but left there on several occasions ; in 1628 he went to venice again , where he met and studied with claudio monteverdi his dresden compositions during the thirty years ' war were , by necessity of the times , smaller scale than the oft-massive works before , although this period produced much of his most charming music he was buried in the old dresden frauenkirche , but his tomb was destroyed in 1727 when the church was torn down to build the new dresden frauenkirche schütz 's compositions show the influence of his teacher gabrieli ( displayed most notably with schütz 's use of resplendent polychoral and concertato styles ) and of monteverdi his best known works are in the field of sacred music , ranging from solo voice with instrumental accompaniment to a cappella choral music the style of the north german organ school derives largely from schütz ( as well as from the dutchman jan pieterszoon sweelinck ) ; a century later this music was to culminate in the work of j.s in schütz research literature , regarded as inauthentic and not portraying heinrich schütz

edward was one of five sons of robert de brus and marjorie , countess of carrick , but the order is uncertain robert the bruce was the eldest ; in the past there was some dispute over whether edward was second , or third behind nigel , but one recent account has him fourth behind nigel and alexander michael penman , robert the bruce , king of the scots his date of birth is unknown , but it was probably not very long after robert was born in 1274 ; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after 105 this was a common scottish and irish cultural practice , and would tie in with , and perhaps explain , parts of his later life edward fought alongside robert throughout his struggle for the scottish throne , including his desperate period on the run and as a guerrilla it was he who made a possibly ill-judged pact with the english governor of stirling castle , which led to the english sending a large army to relieve the castle this led to the battle of bannockburn on 23–24 june 1314 , where he commanded a scottish schiltrom traquair , peter freedom 's sword some time between 1309 and 1313 , edward was created earl of carrick , a title previously held by his maternal grandfather niall of carrick , his mother and his elder brother by the early 14th century , ireland had not had a high king since ruaidri mac tairrdelbach ua conchobair , ( rory o'connor ) , who had been deposed by his son in 1186 the country was divided between irish dynasties and anglo-irish lords who ruled parts of ireland being descended from aoife macmurrough , edward could also claim a lengthy royal gaelic irish ancestry that included brian boru and dermot macmurrough ; and also the norse-gael king olaf cuaran edward 's main mission in invading ireland was to create a second front in the ongoing war against england , draining her of much needed men , materials and finance by creating havoc in ireland ó néill had been troubled by anglo-irish incursions to the south-east ( the de verdons ) , the east ( tenants of the earl of ulster ) and west ( also by the earl of ulster ) of tír eógain and in order to retain his lands , he and some twelve of his vassals and allies jointly asked for aid from scotland the bruce brothers agreed , on condition that they would support edward as king of ireland , as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of scotland and ireland , while robert would regain man and edward possibly making an attack on wales , with welsh support he had previously fought against the bruces at bannockburn where he was taken prisoner and freed to return king edward ii 's royal seal , lost in the rout as king robert did not yet have any legitimate male heir , edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as king of scotland and all other titles in case of his death '' edward meanwhile was swiftly faced by an army led by vassals of the earl of ulster such as the de mandevilles , savages , logans and bissets of the glens , and their irish allies , led by sir thomas de mandeville in early june , ó néill and some twelve fellow northern kings and lords met edward bruce at carrickfergus and swore fealty to him as king of ireland edward was killed , his body being quartered and sent to various towns in ireland , and his head being delivered to king edward ii so while everywhere the gaelic recovery of lost territories was remarkable , there was never any serious attempt made to unite gaelic ireland or to bring about the downfall of the english government in ireland and the end of the colony robert the bruce 's irish wars : the invasions of ireland 1306-1329 , sean duffy , 2004

edward was one of five sons of robert de brus and marjorie , countess of carrick , but the order is uncertain robert the bruce was the eldest ; in the past there was some dispute over whether edward was second , or third behind nigel , but one recent account has him fourth behind nigel and alexander michael penman , robert the bruce , king of the scots his date of birth is unknown , but it was probably not very long after robert was born in 1274 ; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after the irish medievalist seán duffy suggests that he was probably fostered in ireland as a child , likely by the o'neills of ulster , while archie duncan suggests some period of time spent with the bissetts of the glens of antrim , '' the scots ' invasion of ireland , 1315 '' , in r.r edward fought alongside robert throughout his struggle for the scottish throne , including his desperate period on the run and as a guerrilla the three younger bruce brothers nigel , thomas , and alexander were all captured and executed by the english during this period , but edward survived traquair , peter freedom 's sword some time between 1309 and 1313 , edward was created earl of carrick , a title previously held by his maternal grandfather niall of carrick , his mother and his elder brother edward 's main mission in invading ireland was to create a second front in the ongoing war against england , draining her of much needed men , materials and finance by creating havoc in ireland this became critical when the isle of man was recaptured by english-backed scots from king robert 's control in january 1315 , thereby threatening the south and south-west of scotland and also reopening up a potential source of aid to the english from the anglo-irish and native irish the bruce brothers agreed , on condition that they would support edward as king of ireland , as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of scotland and ireland , while robert would regain man and edward possibly making an attack on wales , with welsh support at about this point , roger mortimer , 1st earl of march , received news from irish sources that an invasion was about to take place , and made his way to ireland where he held land , mainly in and around the castle and town of trim he had previously fought against the bruces at bannockburn where he was taken prisoner and freed to return king edward ii 's royal seal , lost in the rout as king robert did not yet have any legitimate male heir , edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as king of scotland and all other titles in case of his death '' edward meanwhile was swiftly faced by an army led by vassals of the earl of ulster such as the de mandevilles , savages , logans and bissets of the glens , and their irish allies , led by sir thomas de mandeville in early june , ó néill and some twelve fellow northern kings and lords met edward bruce at carrickfergus and swore fealty to him as king of ireland the irish annals state that de brus '' took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed king of ireland and all the gaels of ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him king of ireland in late june , edward proceeded with his army from carrickfergus along magh line ( six mile water ) , burning rathmore , near antrim town , which was a holding of the savages de burgh moved his army north of louth and set up camp while his cousin , william liath de burgh attempted to ambush edward 's forces on 14 october 1318 , the scots-irish army was badly defeated at the battle of faughart by de bermingham 's forces so while everywhere the gaelic recovery of lost territories was remarkable , there was never any serious attempt made to unite gaelic ireland or to bring about the downfall of the english government in ireland and the end of the colony

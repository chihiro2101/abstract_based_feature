edward was one of five sons of robert de brus and marjorie , countess of carrick , but the order is uncertain robert the bruce was the eldest ; in the past there was some dispute over whether edward was second , or third behind nigel , but one recent account has him fourth behind nigel and alexander michael penman , robert the bruce , king of the scots his date of birth is unknown , but it was probably not very long after robert was born in 1274 ; he was old enough to be fighting in 1307 and to be given an independent command not long after the irish medievalist seán duffy suggests that he was probably fostered in ireland as a child , likely by the o'neills of ulster , while archie duncan suggests some period of time spent with the bissetts of the glens of antrim edward fought alongside robert throughout his struggle for the scottish throne , including his desperate period on the run and as a guerrilla the three younger bruce brothers nigel , thomas , and alexander were all captured and executed by the english during this period , but edward survived traquair , peter freedom 's sword some time between 1309 and 1313 , edward was created earl of carrick , a title previously held by his maternal grandfather niall of carrick , his mother and his elder brother by the early 14th century , ireland had not had a high king since ruaidri mac tairrdelbach ua conchobair , ( rory o'connor ) , who had been deposed by his son in 1186 being descended from aoife macmurrough , edward could also claim a lengthy royal gaelic irish ancestry that included brian boru and dermot macmurrough ; and also the norse-gael king olaf cuaran edward 's main mission in invading ireland was to create a second front in the ongoing war against england , draining her of much needed men , materials and finance by creating havoc in ireland the bruce brothers agreed , on condition that they would support edward as king of ireland , as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of scotland and ireland , while robert would regain man and edward possibly making an attack on wales , with welsh support at about this point , roger mortimer , 1st earl of march , received news from irish sources that an invasion was about to take place , and made his way to ireland where he held land , mainly in and around the castle and town of trim he had previously fought against the bruces at bannockburn where he was taken prisoner and freed to return king edward ii 's royal seal , lost in the rout as king robert did not yet have any legitimate male heir , edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as king of scotland and all other titles in case of his death in early june , ó néill and some twelve fellow northern kings and lords met edward bruce at carrickfergus and swore fealty to him as king of ireland the irish annals state that de brus '' took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed king of ireland and all the gaels of ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him king of ireland at the same time , governor of ireland ( and bishop of ely ) john hotham began to take drastic action to defend dublin from de brus , such as leveling entire tenements and churches edward was killed , his body being quartered and sent to various towns in ireland , and his head being delivered to king edward ii the annals of ulster ( erroneously under the year 1315 ) summed up the hostile feeling held by many among the anglo-irish and irish alike of edward de brus : '' edward de brus , the destroyer of ireland in general , both foreigners and gaels , was killed by the foreigners of ireland by dint of fighting at dun-delgan edward bruce created havoc in the colonised parts of ireland , and might be said to have nearly brought the settlement to its knees but despite this , he failed in the end , and with him the attempt to create a kingdom of ireland and drive out the settlers ceased so while everywhere the gaelic recovery of lost territories was remarkable , there was never any serious attempt made to unite gaelic ireland or to bring about the downfall of the english government in ireland and the end of the colony

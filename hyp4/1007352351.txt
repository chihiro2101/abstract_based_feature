in inductive reasoning , one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them first of all , it is not certain , regardless of the number of observations , that the woman always walks by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday in fact , david hume would even argue that we can not claim it is '' more probable '' , since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future second , the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning , except inductively the works of the pyrrhonism philosopher sextus empiricus contain the oldest surviving questioning of the validity of inductive reasoning the focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from hume 's focus upon the circular reasoning of induction '' she concludes that '' hume 's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction david hume , a scottish thinker of the enlightenment era , is the philosopher most often associated with induction his formulation of the problem of induction can be found in an enquiry concerning human understanding , §4 '' relations of ideas are propositions which can be derived from deductive logic , which can be found in fields such as geometry and algebra '' hume situates his introduction to the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature within his larger discussion on the nature of causes and effects ( book i , part iii , section vi ) instead , the human mind imputes causation to phenomena after repeatedly observing a connection between two objects for hume , establishing the link between causes and effects relies not on reasoning alone , but the observation of '' constant conjunction '' throughout one 's sensory experience from this discussion , hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature , writing '' there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove , that those instances , of which we have had no experience , resemble those , of which we have had experience while deductive logic allows one to arrive at a conclusion with certainty , inductive logic can only provide a conclusion that is probably true it is mistaken to frame the difference between deductive and inductive logic as one between general to specific reasoning and specific to general reasoning therefore , hume establishes induction as the very grounds for attributing causation however , the future resemblance of these connections to connections observed in the past depends on induction hume offers no solution to the problem of induction himself he prompts other thinkers and logicians to argue for the validity of induction as an ongoing dilemma for philosophy this is because people commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate for example , one might argue that it is valid to use inductive inference in the future because this type of reasoning has yielded accurate results in the past however , this argument relies on an inductive premise itself—that past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid quine offers a practical solution to this problem reprinted in : quine ( 1969 ) , ontological relativity and other essays , ch '' one form of skepticism about induction '' , in richard swinburne ( ed mellor hume and the problem of induction secular responses to the problem of induction , by james n anderson the pragmatic problem of induction , by thomas bullemore understanding scientific progress , by nicholas maxwell the problem of induction and metaphysical assumptions concerning the comprehensibility and knowability of the universe by nicholas maxwell

in inductive reasoning , one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them that next monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations , it does not prove she will walk by the market every monday first of all , it is not certain , regardless of the number of observations , that the woman always walks by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday in fact , david hume would even argue that we can not claim it is '' more probable '' , since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future second , the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning , except inductively the works of the pyrrhonism philosopher sextus empiricus contain the oldest surviving questioning of the validity of inductive reasoning what was hume 's contribution to the problem of induction ? the philosophical quarterly 45 ( 181 ) :460–470 that although sextus 's approach to the problem appears different , hume 's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by sextus : sextus empiricus 179 although the regress argument applies to both deduction and induction , weintraub believes that sextus 's argument '' is precisely the strategy hume invokes against induction : it can not be justified , because the purported justification , being inductive , is circular the cārvāka , a materialist and skeptic school of indian philosophy , used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge ( 2001 ) , the science of conjecture : evidence and probability before pascal ( baltimore : johns hopkins university press ) , 232–233 , 241 david hume , a scottish thinker of the enlightenment era , is the philosopher most often associated with induction '' relations of ideas are propositions which can be derived from deductive logic , which can be found in fields such as geometry and algebra while relations of ideas are supported by reason alone , matters of fact must rely on the connection of a cause and effect through experience '' hume situates his introduction to the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature within his larger discussion on the nature of causes and effects ( book i , part iii , section vi ) from this discussion , hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature , writing '' there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove , that those instances , of which we have had no experience , resemble those , of which we have had experience it is mistaken to frame the difference between deductive and inductive logic as one between general to specific reasoning and specific to general reasoning this is a common misperception about the difference between inductive and deductive thinking over repeated observation , one establishes that a certain set of effects are linked to a certain set of causes however , the future resemblance of these connections to connections observed in the past depends on induction one does not make an inductive reference through a priori reasoning , but through an imaginative step automatically taken by the mind this is because people commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate nelson goodman 's fact , fiction , and forecast presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled '' the new riddle of induction '' harvard university press , 1983 , p.74 , '' will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue '' goodman ’ s original definition of grue ) observed to be green before a certain time t , or blue if observed after that time given the same set of observations of green emeralds , someone using the predicate '' grue '' will inductively infer that all emeralds , which will be observed after t , will be blue , despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far karl popper , a philosophy of science , sought to solve the problem of induction according to popper , the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question : it is asking how to justify theories given they can not be justified by induction ( 1973 ) by david stove discovering karl popper by peter singer the warrant of induction by d this book sets out to solve the problem of induction and related problems associated with scientific progress

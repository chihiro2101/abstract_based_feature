in inductive reasoning , one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them that next monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations , it does not prove she will walk by the market every monday first of all , it is not certain , regardless of the number of observations , that the woman always walks by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday in fact , david hume would even argue that we can not claim it is '' more probable '' , since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future second , the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning , except inductively the focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from hume 's focus upon the circular reasoning of induction 179 although the regress argument applies to both deduction and induction , weintraub believes that sextus 's argument '' is precisely the strategy hume invokes against induction : it can not be justified , because the purported justification , being inductive , is circular '' she concludes that '' hume 's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction the cārvāka , a materialist and skeptic school of indian philosophy , used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge radhakrishnan , indian philosophy vol i , p piotr balcerowicz , '' jayarāśi '' franco , eli , 1987 , perception , knowledge and disbelief : a study of jayarāśi 's scepticism ( 2001 ) , the science of conjecture : evidence and probability before pascal ( baltimore : johns hopkins university press ) , 232–233 , 241 david hume , a scottish thinker of the enlightenment era , is the philosopher most often associated with induction specifically , matters of fact are established by making an inference about causes and effects from repeatedly observed experience '' hume situates his introduction to the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature within his larger discussion on the nature of causes and effects ( book i , part iii , section vi ) for hume , establishing the link between causes and effects relies not on reasoning alone , but the observation of '' constant conjunction '' throughout one 's sensory experience from this discussion , hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature , writing '' there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove , that those instances , of which we have had no experience , resemble those , of which we have had experience '' in other words , the problem of induction can be framed in the following way : we can not apply a conclusion about a particular set of observations to a more general set of observations it is mistaken to frame the difference between deductive and inductive logic as one between general to specific reasoning and specific to general reasoning therefore , hume establishes induction as the very grounds for attributing causation over repeated observation , one establishes that a certain set of effects are linked to a certain set of causes one does not make an inductive reference through a priori reasoning , but through an imaginative step automatically taken by the mind hume does not challenge that induction is performed by the human mind automatically , but rather hopes to show more clearly how much human inference depends on inductive—not a priori—reasoning a key issue with establishing the validity of induction is that one is tempted to use an inductive inference as a form of justification itself however , this argument relies on an inductive premise itself—that past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid thus , many solutions to the problem of induction tend to be circular karl popper , a philosophy of science , sought to solve the problem of induction mellor hume and the problem of induction secular responses to the problem of induction , by james n

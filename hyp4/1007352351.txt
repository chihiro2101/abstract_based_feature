in inductive reasoning , one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them that next monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations , it does not prove she will walk by the market every monday first of all , it is not certain , regardless of the number of observations , that the woman always walks by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday in fact , david hume would even argue that we can not claim it is '' more probable '' , since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future second , the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning , except inductively the works of the pyrrhonism philosopher sextus empiricus contain the oldest surviving questioning of the validity of inductive reasoning what was hume 's contribution to the problem of induction ? the philosophical quarterly 45 ( 181 ) :460–470 that although sextus 's approach to the problem appears different , hume 's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by sextus : sextus empiricus 179 although the regress argument applies to both deduction and induction , weintraub believes that sextus 's argument '' is precisely the strategy hume invokes against induction : it can not be justified , because the purported justification , being inductive , is circular the cārvāka , a materialist and skeptic school of indian philosophy , used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge medieval writers such as al-ghazali and william of ockham connected the problem with god 's absolute power , asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when god could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite ( 2001 ) , the science of conjecture : evidence and probability before pascal ( baltimore : johns hopkins university press ) , 232–233 , 241 while relations of ideas are supported by reason alone , matters of fact must rely on the connection of a cause and effect through experience causes of effects can not be linked through a priori reasoning , but by positing a '' necessary connection '' that depends on the '' uniformity of nature from this discussion , hume goes onto present his formulation of the problem of induction in a treatise of human nature , writing '' there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove , that those instances , of which we have had no experience , resemble those , of which we have had experience over repeated observation , one establishes that a certain set of effects are linked to a certain set of causes however , the future resemblance of these connections to connections observed in the past depends on induction induction allows one to conclude that '' effect a2 '' was caused by '' cause a2 '' because a connection between '' effect a1 '' and '' cause a1 '' was observed repeatedly in the past given that reason alone can not be sufficient to establish the grounds of induction , hume implies that induction must be accomplished through imagination he does not deny future uses of induction , but shows that it is distinct from deductive reasoning , helps to ground causation , and wants to inquire more deeply into its validity a key issue with establishing the validity of induction is that one is tempted to use an inductive inference as a form of justification itself this is because people commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate however , this argument relies on an inductive premise itself—that past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid nelson goodman 's fact , fiction , and forecast presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled '' the new riddle of induction '' the '' new '' problem of induction is , since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue , why do we suppose that after time t we will find green but not grue emeralds ? the problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions given the same set of observations of green emeralds , someone using the predicate '' grue '' will inductively infer that all emeralds , which will be observed after t , will be blue , despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far according to popper , the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question : it is asking how to justify theories given they can not be justified by induction mellor hume and the problem of induction secular responses to the problem of induction , by james n the problem of induction and metaphysical assumptions concerning the comprehensibility and knowability of the universe by nicholas maxwell

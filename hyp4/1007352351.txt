in inductive reasoning , one makes a series of observations and infers a new claim based on them that next monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations , it does not prove she will walk by the market every monday first of all , it is not certain , regardless of the number of observations , that the woman always walks by the market at 8 & nbsp ; am on monday in fact , david hume would even argue that we can not claim it is '' more probable '' , since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future second , the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning , except inductively the works of the pyrrhonism philosopher sextus empiricus contain the oldest surviving questioning of the validity of inductive reasoning the focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from hume 's focus upon the circular reasoning of induction what was hume 's contribution to the problem of induction ? the philosophical quarterly 45 ( 181 ) :460–470 that although sextus 's approach to the problem appears different , hume 's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by sextus : sextus empiricus '' she ends with a discussion of hume 's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction , which hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern foundationalism the cārvāka , a materialist and skeptic school of indian philosophy , used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge medieval writers such as al-ghazali and william of ockham connected the problem with god 's absolute power , asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when god could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite duns scotus , however , argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by '' a proposition reposing in the soul , 'whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free , is the natural effect of that cause some 17th-century jesuits argued that although god could create the end of the world at any moment , it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified for hume , establishing the link between causes and effects relies not on reasoning alone , but the observation of '' constant conjunction '' throughout one 's sensory experience '' in other words , the problem of induction can be framed in the following way : we can not apply a conclusion about a particular set of observations to a more general set of observations given that reason alone can not be sufficient to establish the grounds of induction , hume implies that induction must be accomplished through imagination one does not make an inductive reference through a priori reasoning , but through an imaginative step automatically taken by the mind hume does not challenge that induction is performed by the human mind automatically , but rather hopes to show more clearly how much human inference depends on inductive—not a priori—reasoning hume offers no solution to the problem of induction himself this is because people commonly justify the validity of induction by pointing to the many instances in the past when induction proved to be accurate however , this argument relies on an inductive premise itself—that past observations of induction being valid will mean that future observations of induction will also be valid thus , many solutions to the problem of induction tend to be circular harvard university press , 1983 , p.74 , '' will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue '' goodman ’ s original definition of grue ) observed to be green before a certain time t , or blue if observed after that time the '' new '' problem of induction is , since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue , why do we suppose that after time t we will find green but not grue emeralds ? the problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions given the same set of observations of green emeralds , someone using the predicate '' grue '' will inductively infer that all emeralds , which will be observed after t , will be blue , despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far he argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the possibility of a reason for the predicate , located in the enduring nature of something consequently , – contra hume – some form of principle of homogeneity ( causal or structural ) between future and past must be warranted , which would make some inductive procedure always possible mellor hume and the problem of induction secular responses to the problem of induction , by james n

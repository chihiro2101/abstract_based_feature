in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots one goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , '' for azazel '' this goat was then cast out in the desert as part of yom kippur the scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century bc ebla , from where it spread throughout the ancient near east in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down and the king james version also give readings such as young 's literal translation : '' and aaron hath given lots over the two goats , one lot for jehovah , and one lot for a goat of departure ' '' having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever '' he then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat '' for azazel '' ; and laying his hands upon it again , recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness : '' o lord , i have acted iniquitously , trespassed , sinned before thee : i , my household , and the sons of aaron thy holy ones a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from jerusalem to the steep mountain at each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink , which he , however , refused when he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts , one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat 's horns , and then pushed the goat down ( yoma vi men were stationed at intervals along the way , and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice , they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags , until the information reached the high priest , whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual in later times the change to white was not invariable : a proof of the people 's moral and spiritual deterioration , that was gradually on the increase , until forty years before the destruction of the second temple , when the change of color was no longer observed ( l.c the medieval scholar nahmanides ( 1194–1270 ) identified the hebrew text as also referring to a demon , and identified this '' azazel '' with samael however , he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring azazel as a deity , but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people 's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin , the source of all impurity the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god so would the crowd , called babylonians or alexandrians , pull the goat 's hair to make it hasten forth , carrying the burden of sins away with it ( yoma vi the vulgate contains no mention of '' azazel '' but only of caper emissarius , or '' emissary goat '' : english versions , such as the king james version , followed the septuagint and vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' just as in 3 enoch , angels complained about humans iniquity , whereupon god offered a test , that the angels might choose three among them to descend to earth , endowed with bodily desires , and proof that they would do better than humans under the same conditions 182 to date no evidence has surfaced of azazel as a demon or god prior to the earliest jewish sources among the dead sea scrolls they also claim that hebrews 1:5 '' for unto which of the angels said he at any time , thou art my son , this day have i begotten thee ? '' argues that god never referred to angels as his sons '' god sees the sin brought about by azazel and has raphael “ bind azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness : and make an opening in the desert – which is in dudael – and cast him therein '' thus , the place of asael ’ s punishment designated in enoch as dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the yom kippur ritual azazel ( marvel comics ) azazel in popular culture baphomet dudael lucifer the master and margarita palorchestes ( australian large extinct marsupial ) samyaza scapegoat watcher ( angel ) zazel ( spirit ) zazel ( erotic art film 1997 )

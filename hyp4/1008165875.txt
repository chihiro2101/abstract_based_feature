in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots one goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , '' for azazel '' this goat was then cast out in the desert as part of yom kippur the scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century bc ebla , from where it spread throughout the ancient near east in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down yoma 67b ; sifra , aḥare , ii the mishnah ( yoma 39a yoma 39 ) follows the hebrew bible text ; two goats were procured , similar in respect of appearance , height , cost , and time of selection having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever o lord , forgive the iniquities , transgressions , and sins that i , my household , and aaron 's children , thy holy people , committed before thee , as is written in the law of moses , thy servant , 'for on this day he will forgive you , to cleanse you from all your sins before the lord ; ye shall be clean a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from jerusalem to the steep mountain when he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts , one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat 's horns , and then pushed the goat down ( yoma vi 39a ) that during the forty years that simeon the just was high priest of israel , the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice : a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven in later times the change to white was not invariable : a proof of the people 's moral and spiritual deterioration , that was gradually on the increase , until forty years before the destruction of the second temple , when the change of color was no longer observed ( l.c the medieval scholar nahmanides ( 1194–1270 ) identified the hebrew text as also referring to a demon , and identified this '' azazel '' with samael however , he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring azazel as a deity , but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people 's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin , the source of all impurity the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god ) , and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of bet ḥadudo , twelve miles away from the city , was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of jerusalem , who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills ( yoma vi the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ;

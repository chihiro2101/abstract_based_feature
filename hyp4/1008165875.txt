in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots one goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , '' for azazel '' this goat was then cast out in the desert as part of yom kippur the scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century bc ebla , from where it spread throughout the ancient near east and the king james version also give readings such as young 's literal translation : '' and aaron hath given lots over the two goats , one lot for jehovah , and one lot for a goat of departure ' '' according to the peshitta , azazel is rendered za-za-e'il ( the strong one against/of god ) , as in qumran fragment 4q180 the mishnah ( yoma 39a yoma 39 ) follows the hebrew bible text ; two goats were procured , similar in respect of appearance , height , cost , and time of selection having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem when he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts , one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat 's horns , and then pushed the goat down ( yoma vi the medieval scholar nahmanides ( 1194–1270 ) identified the hebrew text as also referring to a demon , and identified this '' azazel '' with samael so would the crowd , called babylonians or alexandrians , pull the goat 's hair to make it hasten forth , carrying the burden of sins away with it ( yoma vi evidently the figure of azazel was an object of general fear and awe rather than , as has been conjectured , a foreign product or the invention of a late lawgiver the vulgate contains no mention of '' azazel '' but only of caper emissarius , or '' emissary goat '' : english versions , such as the king james version , followed the septuagint and vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' blair notes that this is an argument without supporting contemporary text evidence it says that the book of enoch , ( extra-biblical jewish theological literature , dated around 200 b.c in islam , azazel appears in relation to the story of harut and marut , a pair of angels mentioned in the quran 135 usually linked the reason of their abode to a narration related to the watchers known from 3 enoch just as in 3 enoch , angels complained about humans iniquity , whereupon god offered a test , that the angels might choose three among them to descend to earth , endowed with bodily desires , and proof that they would do better than humans under the same conditions haggai ben-shammai , shaul shaked , sarah stroumsa ( and patricia crone in this certain chapter ) exchange and transmission across cultural boundaries yehuda greenbaum 2005 p levy the symbolism of the azazel goat 1998 '' the midrash is less elaborate than in 1 enoch , and , notably , makes no mention of azazel or asa ' el at all the six old testament passages cited do not support the claim that '' sons of god '' is referring to all humanity , but only that god did refer to israel and judah as his children enoch portrays azazel as responsible for teaching people to make weapons and cosmetics , for which he was cast out of heaven ” azazel 's fate is foretold near the end of enoch 2:8 , where god says , “ on the day of apocalypse he shall be cast into the fire ” several scholars have previously discerned that some details of azazel 's punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat rite

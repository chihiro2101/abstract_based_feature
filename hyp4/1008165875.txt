in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots one goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , '' for azazel '' the scapegoat ritual can be traced back to 24th century bc ebla , from where it spread throughout the ancient near east in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down and the king james version also give readings such as young 's literal translation : '' and aaron hath given lots over the two goats , one lot for jehovah , and one lot for a goat of departure ' '' according to the peshitta , azazel is rendered za-za-e'il ( the strong one against/of god ) , as in qumran fragment 4q180 the mishnah ( yoma 39a yoma 39 ) follows the hebrew bible text ; two goats were procured , similar in respect of appearance , height , cost , and time of selection having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever o lord , forgive the iniquities , transgressions , and sins that i , my household , and aaron 's children , thy holy people , committed before thee , as is written in the law of moses , thy servant , 'for on this day he will forgive you , to cleanse you from all your sins before the lord ; ye shall be clean a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem when he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts , one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat 's horns , and then pushed the goat down ( yoma vi the cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below , its limbs were utterly shattered men were stationed at intervals along the way , and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice , they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags , until the information reached the high priest , whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual 39a ) that during the forty years that simeon the just was high priest of israel , the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice : a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven in later times the change to white was not invariable : a proof of the people 's moral and spiritual deterioration , that was gradually on the increase , until forty years before the destruction of the second temple , when the change of color was no longer observed ( l.c the medieval scholar nahmanides ( 1194–1270 ) identified the hebrew text as also referring to a demon , and identified this '' azazel '' with samael the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god so would the crowd , called babylonians or alexandrians , pull the goat 's hair to make it hasten forth , carrying the burden of sins away with it ( yoma vi the vulgate contains no mention of '' azazel '' but only of caper emissarius , or '' emissary goat '' : english versions , such as the king james version , followed the septuagint and vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' the ebc ( vol 2 ) says that this text uses late aramaic forms for these names which indicates that the book of enoch most likely relies upon the hebrew leviticus text rather than the leviticus text being reliant upon the book of enoch in 1 john 3 , the author , who refers to his audience as '' my little children '' , does , indeed , proclaim that those who are in christ ( 1 john 1:28 ) are god 's children , but this has nothing to do with the benê ’ ʾělō·hîm of gen 6 because they existed thousands of years before any christians the only other usage of benê ’ ʾělō·hîm in the hebrew bible is found in job 1:6 , and job 2:1 , both of which refer to supernatural beings but the ancient understanding of benê ’ ʾělō·hîm as supernatural beings was so firmly established over the history of israel and judah that in the septuagint , which was completed some time between the 3rd and 1st century b.c , the term '' sons of god '' is replaced with '' angels of god '' in all three of these verses ” azazel 's fate is foretold near the end of enoch 2:8 , where god says , “ on the day of apocalypse he shall be cast into the fire 383–405 in the fifth-century 3 enoch , azazel is one of the three angels ( azza shemhazai and uzza ouza are the other two ) who opposed enoch 's high rank when he became the angel metatron

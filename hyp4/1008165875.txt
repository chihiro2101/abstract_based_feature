in the hebrew bible , the term is used thrice in leviticus 16 , where two male goats were to be sacrificed to yahweh and one of the two was cleromancy , for yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots one goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness , '' for azazel '' this goat was then cast out in the desert as part of yom kippur in older english versions , such as the king james version , the phrase la-azazel is translated as '' as a scapegoat '' ; however , in most modern english bible translations , it is represented as a name in the text : later rabbis , interpreting azazel as azaz ( rugged ) and el ( of god ) , take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down and the king james version also give readings such as young 's literal translation : '' and aaron hath given lots over the two goats , one lot for jehovah , and one lot for a goat of departure ' '' the mishnah ( yoma 39a yoma 39 ) follows the hebrew bible text ; two goats were procured , similar in respect of appearance , height , cost , and time of selection having one of these on his right and the other on his left , the high priest , who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates , put both his hands into a wooden case , and took out two labels , one inscribed '' for yahweh '' and the other '' for azazel '' the high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said , '' a sin-offering to yahweh '' ( thus speaking the tetragrammaton ) ; and the two men accompanying him replied , '' blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom for ever and ever '' he then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat '' for azazel '' ; and laying his hands upon it again , recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness : '' o lord , i have acted iniquitously , trespassed , sinned before thee : i , my household , and the sons of aaron thy holy ones o lord , forgive the iniquities , transgressions , and sins that i , my household , and aaron 's children , thy holy people , committed before thee , as is written in the law of moses , thy servant , 'for on this day he will forgive you , to cleanse you from all your sins before the lord ; ye shall be clean a man was selected , preferably a priest , to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness ; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of jerusalem at each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink , which he , however , refused when he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts , one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat 's horns , and then pushed the goat down ( yoma vi men were stationed at intervals along the way , and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice , they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags , until the information reached the high priest , whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual 39a ) that during the forty years that simeon the just was high priest of israel , the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice : a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven the medieval scholar nahmanides ( 1194–1270 ) identified the hebrew text as also referring to a demon , and identified this '' azazel '' with samael however , he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring azazel as a deity , but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people 's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin , the source of all impurity the very fact that the two goats were presented before god , before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness , was proof that azazel was not ranked alongside god , but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of god so would the crowd , called babylonians or alexandrians , pull the goat 's hair to make it hasten forth , carrying the burden of sins away with it ( yoma vi the vulgate contains no mention of '' azazel '' but only of caper emissarius , or '' emissary goat '' : english versions , such as the king james version , followed the septuagint and vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat the modern english standard version provides the footnote '' 16:8 the meaning of azazel is uncertain ; possibly the name of a place or a demon , traditionally a scapegoat ; also verses 10 , 26 '' in islam , azazel appears in relation to the story of harut and marut , a pair of angels mentioned in the quran '' the book of enoch brings azazel into connection with the biblical story of the war in heaven , located on mount hermon , a gathering-place of demons of old '' some believe , however , that the reference to '' sons of god '' in this passage is referring to men in that god formed man from the ground , and women from men book of genesis 2:7,23 and since israel also did not exist until thousands of years after the events of gen 6 , the benê ’ ʾělō·hîm can not be referring to them either ” azazel 's fate is foretold near the end of enoch 2:8 , where god says , “ on the day of apocalypse he shall be cast into the fire 383–405 in the fifth-century 3 enoch , azazel is one of the three angels ( azza shemhazai and uzza ouza are the other two ) who opposed enoch 's high rank when he became the angel metatron

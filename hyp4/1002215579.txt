the columbia plateau province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in miocene and early pliocence epochs across the states of washington , oregon , idaho , nevada , and california the province was uplifted and divided into great blocks by faults or monoclinal flexures and thus exposed to long-lasting denudation in a mid-tertiary cycle of erosion the current erosion cycle was introduced in late tertiary time during which the deep canyons of the region have been trenched the results of the first cycle of erosion are seen in the widespread exposure of the resistant carboniferous limestone as a broad platform in the south-western area of greater uplift through central arizona where the higher formations were worn away they are also seen in the development of a series of huge , south-facing , retreating escarpments of irregular outline on the edges of the higher formations farther north associated with these irregular escarpments are occasional rectilinear ridges , the work of extensive erosion on monoclinal structures the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province with the renewal of uplift by which the earlier cycle of erosion was interrupted and the present cycle introduced , inequalities of surface due to renewed faulting were again introduced these still appear as cliffs , of more nearly rectilinear front than the retreating escarpments formed in the previous cycle these cliffs are peculiar in gradually passing from one formation to another , and in having a height dependent on the displacement of the fault rather than on the structures in the fault face the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground the few rivers of the region must have reached the quiescence of old age in the earlier cycle , but were revived by uplift to a vigorous youth in the current cycle it is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the plateau province are due however the most famous example is the grand canyon of arizona , eroded by the colorado river across the uplifted platform of carboniferous limestone the present form of the higher blocks is more or less affected by erosion since faulting , while many of the lower blocks have been buried under the waste of the higher ones in the upper southern part of the basin and range province , in the mojave desert of california , and sonoran desert of southern california and arizona ( u.s the basin and range province extends southeast down into chihuahua state in northeast mexico , and far south along the mexican plateau to central mexico at the trans-mexican volcanic belt the snake river has cut a deeper canyon farther southeast where the plains are higher and has disclosed the many lava sheets which build up the plains , occasionally revealing a buried mountain in which the superposed river has cut an even narrower canyon one of the most remarkable features of the intermediate province is seen in the temporary course taken by the columbia river across the plains , while its canyon was obstructed by pleistocene glaciers that came from the cascade range on the northwest

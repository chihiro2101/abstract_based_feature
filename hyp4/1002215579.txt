the columbia plateau province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in miocene and early pliocence epochs across the states of washington , oregon , idaho , nevada , and california the current erosion cycle was introduced in late tertiary time during which the deep canyons of the region have been trenched each escarpment is separated from the next higher one by a broad step of weaker strata associated with these irregular escarpments are occasional rectilinear ridges , the work of extensive erosion on monoclinal structures the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province these cliffs are peculiar in gradually passing from one formation to another , and in having a height dependent on the displacement of the fault rather than on the structures in the fault face the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground the few rivers of the region must have reached the quiescence of old age in the earlier cycle , but were revived by uplift to a vigorous youth in the current cycle it is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the plateau province are due however the most famous example is the grand canyon of arizona , eroded by the colorado river across the uplifted platform of carboniferous limestone some of the high plateaus in the north are capped with remnants of heavy lava flows of early eruption the large basin and range province is a basin and range topography resulting from crustal extension ( extensional tectonics ) many of the intermontane plains , occurring mostly in the north , appear to be heavily aggraded with mountain waste here , the amount of dissection is relatively moderate , for some of the fault faces are described as ravined but not yet deeply dissected in fact so ancient that the mountains formed by the folding were worn down to the lowland stage of old age before the block-faulting occurred here the less uplifted blocks are now heavily aggraded with waste from the dissected ranges in the upper southern part of the basin and range province , in the mojave desert of california , and sonoran desert of southern california and arizona ( u.s one of the southwestern basins , with its floor below sea-level , has a plain of salt in its center united states geological survey , accessed december 12 , 2014

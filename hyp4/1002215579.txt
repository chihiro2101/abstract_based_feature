the columbia plateau province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in miocene and early pliocence epochs across the states of washington , oregon , idaho , nevada , and california the province was uplifted and divided into great blocks by faults or monoclinal flexures and thus exposed to long-lasting denudation in a mid-tertiary cycle of erosion the current erosion cycle was introduced in late tertiary time during which the deep canyons of the region have been trenched these still appear as cliffs , of more nearly rectilinear front than the retreating escarpments formed in the previous cycle these cliffs are peculiar in gradually passing from one formation to another , and in having a height dependent on the displacement of the fault rather than on the structures in the fault face the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground the few rivers of the region must have reached the quiescence of old age in the earlier cycle , but were revived by uplift to a vigorous youth in the current cycle it is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the plateau province are due thus the virgin river , a northern tributary of the colorado river , has cut a vertical slit , 1000 & nbsp ; ft a group of large volcanoes occurs on the limestone platform south of the grand canyon , culminating in humphreys peak , a moderately dissected cone , and associated with many more recent smaller cones and freshlooking lava flows it is located in all or parts of oregon , idaho , nevada , california , utah , new mexico , arizona in the western united states ; and sonora , chihuahua , sinaloa , and other states southwards to the trans-mexican volcanic belt in mexico many of the intermontane plains , occurring mostly in the north , appear to be heavily aggraded with mountain waste others , mostly in the south , are valleys also heavily aggraded by mountain erosion when the region was broken into fault blocks and the blocks were uplifted and tilted , the back slope of each block was a part of the previously eroded surface and the face of the block was a surface of fracture the present form of the higher blocks is more or less affected by erosion since faulting , while many of the lower blocks have been buried under the waste of the higher ones in the great basin of western utah and through most of nevada , many of the blocks exhibit deformed structures involving folds and faults of relatively ancient ( jurassic ) date in the upper southern part of the basin and range province , in the mojave desert of california , and sonoran desert of southern california and arizona ( u.s united states geological survey , accessed december 12 , 2014 intermountain west central basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) northern basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) united states physiographic region

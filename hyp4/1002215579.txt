the columbia plateau province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in miocene and early pliocence epochs across the states of washington , oregon , idaho , nevada , and california the province was uplifted and divided into great blocks by faults or monoclinal flexures and thus exposed to long-lasting denudation in a mid-tertiary cycle of erosion the results of the first cycle of erosion are seen in the widespread exposure of the resistant carboniferous limestone as a broad platform in the south-western area of greater uplift through central arizona where the higher formations were worn away they are also seen in the development of a series of huge , south-facing , retreating escarpments of irregular outline on the edges of the higher formations farther north each escarpment is separated from the next higher one by a broad step of weaker strata the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province with the renewal of uplift by which the earlier cycle of erosion was interrupted and the present cycle introduced , inequalities of surface due to renewed faulting were again introduced these cliffs are peculiar in gradually passing from one formation to another , and in having a height dependent on the displacement of the fault rather than on the structures in the fault face the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground it is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the plateau province are due some of the high plateaus in the north are capped with remnants of heavy lava flows of early eruption many of the intermontane plains , occurring mostly in the north , appear to be heavily aggraded with mountain waste the structure of the region previous to faulting was dependent on long antecedent processes of accumulation and deformation and the surface of the region then was dependent on the amount of erosion suffered in the prefaulting cycle when the region was broken into fault blocks and the blocks were uplifted and tilted , the back slope of each block was a part of the previously eroded surface and the face of the block was a surface of fracture in the great basin of western utah and through most of nevada , many of the blocks exhibit deformed structures involving folds and faults of relatively ancient ( jurassic ) date ) and northern sonora ( mexico ) states , the ranges are well dissected and some of the intermontane depressions have rock floors with gentle , centripetal slopes only a small part of the basin and range province is drained to the sea one of the most remarkable features of the intermediate province is seen in the temporary course taken by the columbia river across the plains , while its canyon was obstructed by pleistocene glaciers that came from the cascade range on the northwest intermountain west central basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) northern basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) united states physiographic region

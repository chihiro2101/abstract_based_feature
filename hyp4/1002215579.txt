the columbia plateau province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in miocene and early pliocence epochs across the states of washington , oregon , idaho , nevada , and california the province was uplifted and divided into great blocks by faults or monoclinal flexures and thus exposed to long-lasting denudation in a mid-tertiary cycle of erosion the current erosion cycle was introduced in late tertiary time during which the deep canyons of the region have been trenched the results of the first cycle of erosion are seen in the widespread exposure of the resistant carboniferous limestone as a broad platform in the south-western area of greater uplift through central arizona where the higher formations were worn away the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province with the renewal of uplift by which the earlier cycle of erosion was interrupted and the present cycle introduced , inequalities of surface due to renewed faulting were again introduced these cliffs are peculiar in gradually passing from one formation to another , and in having a height dependent on the displacement of the fault rather than on the structures in the fault face the most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the plateau province where it was uplifted from the lower ground the large basin and range province is a basin and range topography resulting from crustal extension ( extensional tectonics ) it is located in all or parts of oregon , idaho , nevada , california , utah , new mexico , arizona in the western united states ; and sonora , chihuahua , sinaloa , and other states southwards to the trans-mexican volcanic belt in mexico the province is characterized by numerous disconnected mountain ranges trending north and south , from in length , the higher ranges reaching altitudes of , separated by broad , intermontane desert plains or basins at altitudes varying from sea-level ( or a little less ) in the southwest , to farther inland many of the intermontane plains , occurring mostly in the north , appear to be heavily aggraded with mountain waste others , mostly in the south , are valleys also heavily aggraded by mountain erosion when the region was broken into fault blocks and the blocks were uplifted and tilted , the back slope of each block was a part of the previously eroded surface and the face of the block was a surface of fracture ) and northern sonora ( mexico ) states , the ranges are well dissected and some of the intermontane depressions have rock floors with gentle , centripetal slopes the sacramento and san joaquin rivers from the sierra nevada pass through the central valley and california coast ranges to san francisco bay thus the uplifted , dislocated and dissected lava sheets of yellowstone national park in the rocky mountains on the east ( at the headwaters of the snake river ) are associated with the older lavas of the columbian plains one of the most remarkable features of the intermediate province is seen in the temporary course taken by the columbia river across the plains , while its canyon was obstructed by pleistocene glaciers that came from the cascade range on the northwest intermountain west central basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) northern basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) united states physiographic region

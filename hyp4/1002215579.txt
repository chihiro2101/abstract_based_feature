the columbia plateau province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in miocene and early pliocence epochs across the states of washington , oregon , idaho , nevada , and california the province was uplifted and divided into great blocks by faults or monoclinal flexures and thus exposed to long-lasting denudation in a mid-tertiary cycle of erosion the results of the first cycle of erosion are seen in the widespread exposure of the resistant carboniferous limestone as a broad platform in the south-western area of greater uplift through central arizona where the higher formations were worn away the mogollon rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the mogollon plateau of the colorado plateau province and the sonoran desert of the basin and range province with the renewal of uplift by which the earlier cycle of erosion was interrupted and the present cycle introduced , inequalities of surface due to renewed faulting were again introduced it is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the plateau province are due however the most famous example is the grand canyon of arizona , eroded by the colorado river across the uplifted platform of carboniferous limestone during the current cycle of erosion , several of the faults , whose scarps had been worn away in the previous cycle , have been brought to light again as topography features by the removal of the weak strata along one side of the fault line , leaving the harder strata on the other side in relief another consequence of revived erosion is seen in the occurrence of great landslides , where the removal of weak ( permian ) clays has sapped the face of the vermilion cliffs , so that huge slices of the cliff face have slid down and forward , all shattered into a confused tumult of forms for a or more along the cliff base mount taylor in western new mexico is of similar age , but here dissection seems to have advanced farther , probably because of the weaker nature of the underlying rocks the large basin and range province is a basin and range topography resulting from crustal extension ( extensional tectonics ) it is located in all or parts of oregon , idaho , nevada , california , utah , new mexico , arizona in the western united states ; and sonora , chihuahua , sinaloa , and other states southwards to the trans-mexican volcanic belt in mexico the province is characterized by numerous disconnected mountain ranges trending north and south , from in length , the higher ranges reaching altitudes of , separated by broad , intermontane desert plains or basins at altitudes varying from sea-level ( or a little less ) in the southwest , to farther inland the structure of the region previous to faulting was dependent on long antecedent processes of accumulation and deformation and the surface of the region then was dependent on the amount of erosion suffered in the prefaulting cycle the present form of the higher blocks is more or less affected by erosion since faulting , while many of the lower blocks have been buried under the waste of the higher ones in the upper southern part of the basin and range province , in the mojave desert of california , and sonoran desert of southern california and arizona ( u.s ) and northern sonora ( mexico ) states , the ranges are well dissected and some of the intermontane depressions have rock floors with gentle , centripetal slopes the snake river has cut a deeper canyon farther southeast where the plains are higher and has disclosed the many lava sheets which build up the plains , occasionally revealing a buried mountain in which the superposed river has cut an even narrower canyon intermountain west central basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) northern basin and range ecoregion — level iii ecoregion ( epa ) united states physiographic region

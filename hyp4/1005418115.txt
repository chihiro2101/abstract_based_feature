a large ellipse will do for a first game , but some irregularities make the game more interesting each player chooses a color or mark ( such as x and o ) to represent the player 's car each player marks a starting point for his or her car - a grid intersection at or behind the starting line all moves will be from one grid point to another grid point each grid point has eight neighbouring grid points : up , down , left , right , and the four diagonal directions players take turns to move their cars according to some simple rules each move is marked by drawing a line from the starting point of this move to a new point ) on each turn after that , the player can choose to move the same number of squares in the same direction as on the previous turn ; the grid point reached by this move is called the principal point for this turn before starting to play , the players may go over the track , agreeing in advance about each grid point near the boundaries as to whether that point is inside or outside the track alternatively , the track may be drawn with straight lines only , with corners at grid points only players may or may not be allowed to touch the walls , but not to cross them however , the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect , a car can not move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car , as they would collide a crashed car may leave the game , or various systems for penalizing crashes can be devised at the end of the game , one may complete a round another possible rule is to let the loser move first in the next game however , the game has a certain charm of its own , and may be played as a pure recreation

as will follow from a later section , if the mathematical concept of vectors is known , some of the rules may be stated more briefly the rules may also be stated in terms of the physical concepts velocity and acceleration letter preprinted with a 1/4 '' square grid , or a4 with a 5 & nbsp ; mm square grid ) , a freehand loop is drawn as the outer boundary of the racetrack a large ellipse will do for a first game , but some irregularities make the game more interesting each player marks a starting point for his or her car - a grid intersection at or behind the starting line players take turns to move their cars according to some simple rules each move is marked by drawing a line from the starting point of this move to a new point ) however , the player also has the choice of any of the eight neighbours of this principal point when drawing the track , slippery regions with oil spill may be marked , wherein the cars can not change velocity at all , or only according to the four neighbours rule usually , cars are required to stay on the track for the entire length of the move , not just the start and end however , the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect , a car can not move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car , as they would collide , a move four squares to the right and two up may be represented by the vector ( 4,2 ) however , the game has a certain charm of its own , and may be played as a pure recreation the game used a laminated board which could be written on with a grease pencil graph racers racetrack '' racetrack , as it was played in the 1960s '' vector racer ( aka racetrack ) online karopapier.de or graphracer.com online game to race against others ( currently german only , translations available )

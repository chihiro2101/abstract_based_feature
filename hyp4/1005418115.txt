the rules may also be stated in terms of the physical concepts velocity and acceleration on a sheet of quadrille paper ( '' quad pad '' , e.g a large ellipse will do for a first game , but some irregularities make the game more interesting each player chooses a color or mark ( such as x and o ) to represent the player 's car each player marks a starting point for his or her car - a grid intersection at or behind the starting line all moves will be from one grid point to another grid point each grid point has eight neighbouring grid points : up , down , left , right , and the four diagonal directions players take turns to move their cars according to some simple rules each move is marked by drawing a line from the starting point of this move to a new point each player 's first move must be to one of the eight neighbours of their starting position ) however , the player also has the choice of any of the eight neighbours of this principal point a crashed car may leave the game , or various systems for penalizing crashes can be devised this may be partially counterbalanced by having the players choose their individual starting points in reverse order another possible rule is to let the loser move first in the next game each move may be represented by a vector however , the game has a certain charm of its own , and may be played as a pure recreation

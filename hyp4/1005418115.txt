as will follow from a later section , if the mathematical concept of vectors is known , some of the rules may be stated more briefly the rules may also be stated in terms of the physical concepts velocity and acceleration letter preprinted with a 1/4 '' square grid , or a4 with a 5 & nbsp ; mm square grid ) , a freehand loop is drawn as the outer boundary of the racetrack a large ellipse will do for a first game , but some irregularities make the game more interesting each player marks a starting point for his or her car - a grid intersection at or behind the starting line each grid point has eight neighbouring grid points : up , down , left , right , and the four diagonal directions each move is marked by drawing a line from the starting point of this move to a new point each player 's first move must be to one of the eight neighbours of their starting position ) on each turn after that , the player can choose to move the same number of squares in the same direction as on the previous turn ; the grid point reached by this move is called the principal point for this turn ) however , the player also has the choice of any of the eight neighbours of this principal point alternatively , the track may be drawn with straight lines only , with corners at grid points only when drawing the track , slippery regions with oil spill may be marked , wherein the cars can not change velocity at all , or only according to the four neighbours rule on heavily convoluted racetracks , allowing the line segment representing a move to cross the boundary twice ( with start and end points inside the track ) , some unreasonable shortcuts may be allowed however , the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect , a car can not move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car , as they would collide a player running off the track may be allowed to continue , but is required to brake and turn around , and re-enter the track again crossing the boundary at a point behind the point where it left , a move four squares to the right and two up may be represented by the vector ( 4,2 )

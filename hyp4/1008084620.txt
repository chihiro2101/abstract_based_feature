a meteor shower in august 1583 was recorded in the timbuktu manuscripts new scientist , issue 2617,15 august 2007 , page 39–41 the first great meteor storm in the modern era was the leonids of november 1833 after spending the last weeks of 1833 collecting information , he presented his findings in january 1834 to the american journal of science and arts , published in january–april 1834 , and january 1836 he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space russell , meteor watch organizer , by richard taibi , may 19 , 2013 , accessed 21 may 2013 the actual nature of meteors was still debated during the 19th century meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit the same results were independently arrived at by adolf berberich of the königliches astronomisches rechen institut ( royal astronomical computation institute ) in berlin , germany although the absence of meteor storms that season confirmed the calculations , the advance of much better computing tools was needed to arrive at reliable predictions yeomans of the jet propulsion laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of comet tempel-tuttle reznikov of kazan state university first correctly identified the years when dust was released which was responsible for several past leonid meteor storms because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky this radiant point is caused by the effect of perspective , similar to parallel railroad tracks converging at a single vanishing point on the horizon the radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars ( radiant drift ) due to the earth moving in its orbit around the sun '' when the moving radiant is at the highest point it will reach in the observer 's sky that night , the sun will be just clearing the eastern horizon for this reason , the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing , and the lightening sky which makes them harder to see the international astronomical union 's task group on meteor shower nomenclature and the iau 's meteor data center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet meteor showers and their parent comets the meteors we see from these streams are part of annual showers , because earth encounters those streams every year at much the same rate any other solar system body with a reasonably transparent atmosphere can also have meteor showers on march 7 , 2004 , the panoramic camera on mars exploration rover spirit recorded a streak which is now believed to have been caused by a meteor from a martian meteor shower associated with comet 114p/wiseman-skiff lorenz , journal ? ? , vol 43 , issue 5 , october 2002 , pp american meteor society ( ams ) earth-grazing fireball international meteor organization ( imo ) list of meteor showers meteor procession north american meteor network radiant – point in the sky from which meteors appear to originate zenith hourly rate

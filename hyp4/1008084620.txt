new scientist , issue 2617,15 august 2007 , page 39–41 the first great meteor storm in the modern era was the leonids of november 1833 he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space kronk work continued , yet coming to understand the annual nature of showers though the occurrences of storms perplexed researchers russell , meteor watch organizer , by richard taibi , may 19 , 2013 , accessed 21 may 2013 the actual nature of meteors was still debated during the 19th century in the 1890s , irish astronomer george johnstone stoney ( 1826–1911 ) and british astronomer arthur matthew weld downing ( 1850–1917 ) , were the first to attempt to calculate the position of the dust at earth 's orbit meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit although the absence of meteor storms that season confirmed the calculations , the advance of much better computing tools was needed to arrive at reliable predictions yeomans of the jet propulsion laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of comet tempel-tuttle comet 55p/tempel-tuttle and the leonid meteors ( 1996 , see p & nbsp ; 6 ) it showed relative positions of the earth and tempel-tuttle and marks where earth encountered dense dust this showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet , but paths of the earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity reznikov of kazan state university first correctly identified the years when dust was released which was responsible for several past leonid meteor storms because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky this '' fixed point '' slowly moves across the sky during the night due to the earth turning on its axis , the same reason the stars appear to slowly march across the sky the radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars ( radiant drift ) due to the earth moving in its orbit around the sun the international astronomical union 's task group on meteor shower nomenclature and the iau 's meteor data center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established dust mote sized solids are orders of magnitude more common than those the size of sand grains , which , in turn , are similarly more common than those the size of pebbles , and so on the fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust , sand , and pebbles , and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream , which subsequently evolves into earth 's path shortly after whipple predicted that dust particles travelled at low speeds relative to the comet , milos plavec was the first to offer the idea of a dust trail , when he calculated how meteoroids , once freed from the comet , would drift mostly in front of or behind the comet after completing one orbit the detection of a dust trail in the orbit of an earth-threatening long-period comet the most visible meteor shower in most years are the perseids , which peak on 12 august of each year at over one meteor per minute approximately every 33 years , the leonid shower produces a meteor storm , peaking at rates of thousands of meteors per hour , both associated with halley 's comet ) , a '' beta canis major '' shower associated with comet 13p/olbers , and '' draconids '' from 5335 damocles

a meteor shower in august 1583 was recorded in the timbuktu manuscripts new scientist , issue 2617,15 august 2007 , page 39–41 the first great meteor storm in the modern era was the leonids of november 1833 he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space in the 1890s , irish astronomer george johnstone stoney ( 1826–1911 ) and british astronomer arthur matthew weld downing ( 1850–1917 ) , were the first to attempt to calculate the position of the dust at earth 's orbit they studied the dust ejected in 1866 by comet 55p/tempel-tuttle in advance of the anticipated leonid shower return of 1898 and 1899 meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit yeomans of the jet propulsion laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of comet tempel-tuttle this showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet , but paths of the earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky this radiant point is caused by the effect of perspective , similar to parallel railroad tracks converging at a single vanishing point on the horizon meteor showers are almost always named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to originate see imo meteor shower calendar 2017 ( international meteor organization ) for maps of drifting '' fixed points for this reason , the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing , and the lightening sky which makes them harder to see meteor showers are named after the nearest constellation or bright star with a greek or roman letter assigned that is close to the radiant position at the peak of the shower , whereby the grammatical declension of the latin possessive form is replaced by '' id '' or '' ids '' the international astronomical union 's task group on meteor shower nomenclature and the iau 's meteor data center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet these dust trails are sometimes observed in comet images taken at mid infrared wavelengths ( heat radiation ) , where dust particles from the previous return to the sun are spread along the orbit of the comet ( see figures ) for example , the orbits of some repeating comets , and meteoroids leaving them , are in resonant orbits with jupiter or one of the other large planets & nbsp ; – so many revolutions of one will equal another number of revolutions of the other the most visible meteor shower in most years are the perseids , which peak on 12 august of each year at over one meteor per minute leonid storms gave birth to the term meteor shower when it was first realised that , during the november 1833 storm , the meteors radiated from near the star gamma leonis but new craters , perhaps even related to meteor showers are possible only the relatively slower motion of the meteoroids due to increased distance from the sun should marginally decrease meteor brightness american meteor society ( ams ) earth-grazing fireball international meteor organization ( imo ) list of meteor showers meteor procession north american meteor network radiant – point in the sky from which meteors appear to originate zenith hourly rate

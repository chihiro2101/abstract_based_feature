a meteor shower in august 1583 was recorded in the timbuktu manuscripts new scientist , issue 2617,15 august 2007 , page 39–41 the first great meteor storm in the modern era was the leonids of november 1833 he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space russell , meteor watch organizer , by richard taibi , may 19 , 2013 , accessed 21 may 2013 the actual nature of meteors was still debated during the 19th century in the 1890s , irish astronomer george johnstone stoney ( 1826–1911 ) and british astronomer arthur matthew weld downing ( 1850–1917 ) , were the first to attempt to calculate the position of the dust at earth 's orbit they studied the dust ejected in 1866 by comet 55p/tempel-tuttle in advance of the anticipated leonid shower return of 1898 and 1899 meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit although the absence of meteor storms that season confirmed the calculations , the advance of much better computing tools was needed to arrive at reliable predictions yeomans of the jet propulsion laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of comet tempel-tuttle this showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet , but paths of the earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky the radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars ( radiant drift ) due to the earth moving in its orbit around the sun see imo meteor shower calendar 2017 ( international meteor organization ) for maps of drifting '' fixed points '' when the moving radiant is at the highest point it will reach in the observer 's sky that night , the sun will be just clearing the eastern horizon for this reason , the best viewing time for a meteor shower is generally slightly before dawn — a compromise between the maximum number of meteors available for viewing , and the lightening sky which makes them harder to see the international astronomical union 's task group on meteor shower nomenclature and the iau 's meteor data center keep track of meteor shower nomenclature and which showers are established a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet whipple envisioned comets as '' dirty snowballs , '' made up of rock embedded in ice , orbiting the sun has argued that most of our short-period meteor showers are not from the normal water vapor drag of active comets , but the product of infrequent disintegrations , when large chunks break off a mostly dormant comet the fragments tend to fall apart quickly into dust , sand , and pebbles , and spread out along the orbit of the comet to form a dense meteoroid stream , which subsequently evolves into earth 's path any other solar system body with a reasonably transparent atmosphere can also have meteor showers on march 7 , 2004 , the panoramic camera on mars exploration rover spirit recorded a streak which is now believed to have been caused by a meteor from a martian meteor shower associated with comet 114p/wiseman-skiff american meteor society ( ams ) earth-grazing fireball international meteor organization ( imo ) list of meteor showers meteor procession north american meteor network radiant – point in the sky from which meteors appear to originate zenith hourly rate

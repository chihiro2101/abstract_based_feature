a meteor shower in august 1583 was recorded in the timbuktu manuscripts new scientist , issue 2617,15 august 2007 , page 39–41 the first great meteor storm in the modern era was the leonids of november 1833 he noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in europe , and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space kronk work continued , yet coming to understand the annual nature of showers though the occurrences of storms perplexed researchers russell , meteor watch organizer , by richard taibi , may 19 , 2013 , accessed 21 may 2013 the actual nature of meteors was still debated during the 19th century in the 1890s , irish astronomer george johnstone stoney ( 1826–1911 ) and british astronomer arthur matthew weld downing ( 1850–1917 ) , were the first to attempt to calculate the position of the dust at earth 's orbit meteor storms were anticipated , but the final calculations showed that most of the dust would be far inside of earth 's orbit yeomans of the jet propulsion laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of comet tempel-tuttle comet 55p/tempel-tuttle and the leonid meteors ( 1996 , see p & nbsp ; 6 ) it showed relative positions of the earth and tempel-tuttle and marks where earth encountered dense dust in 1995 , peter jenniskens predicted the 1995 alpha monocerotids outburst from dust trails because meteor shower particles are all traveling in parallel paths , and at the same velocity , they will all appear to an observer below to radiate away from a single point in the sky this radiant point is caused by the effect of perspective , similar to parallel railroad tracks converging at a single vanishing point on the horizon meteor showers are almost always named after the constellation from which the meteors appear to originate the radiant also moves slightly from night to night against the background stars ( radiant drift ) due to the earth moving in its orbit around the sun see imo meteor shower calendar 2017 ( international meteor organization ) for maps of drifting '' fixed points a meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet , such as earth , and streams of debris from a comet meteor showers and their parent comets has argued that most of our short-period meteor showers are not from the normal water vapor drag of active comets , but the product of infrequent disintegrations , when large chunks break off a mostly dormant comet these dust trails are sometimes observed in comet images taken at mid infrared wavelengths ( heat radiation ) , where dust particles from the previous return to the sun are spread along the orbit of the comet ( see figures ) the most visible meteor shower in most years are the perseids , which peak on 12 august of each year at over one meteor per minute other showers speculated about are a '' lambda geminid '' shower associated with the eta aquariids of earth ( i.e american meteor society ( ams ) earth-grazing fireball international meteor organization ( imo ) list of meteor showers meteor procession north american meteor network radiant – point in the sky from which meteors appear to originate zenith hourly rate

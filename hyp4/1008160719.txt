an axiomatic system is said to be consistent if it lacks contradiction that is , it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the system 's axioms in an axiomatic system , an axiom is called independent if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system unlike consistency , independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system an axiomatic system is called complete if for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable from the system 's axioms ( equivalently , every statement is capable of being proven true or false ) this describes the scenario where the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second , such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second lines and points are undefined terms ( also called primitive notions ) in absolute geometry , but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system the system has at least two different models – one is the natural numbers ( isomorphic to any other countably infinite set ) , and another is the real numbers ( isomorphic to any other set with the cardinality of the continuum ) however , the property distinguishing these models is their cardinality — a property which can not be defined within the system any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything is based on an axiomatic system first devised by the mathematician giuseppe peano in 1889 he chose the axioms , in the language of a single unary function symbol s ( short for '' successor '' ) , for the set of natural numbers to be : there is a natural number 0 axioms ) that relate a number of primitive terms — in order that a consistent body of propositions may be derived deductively from these statements

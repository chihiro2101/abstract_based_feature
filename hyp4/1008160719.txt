an axiomatic system is said to be consistent if it lacks contradiction that is , it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the system 's axioms in an axiomatic system , an axiom is called independent if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system a system is called independent if each of its underlying axioms is independent unlike consistency , independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system an axiomatic system is called complete if for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable from the system 's axioms ( equivalently , every statement is capable of being proven true or false ) this describes the scenario where the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second , such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system an axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called categorial ( sometimes categorical ) however , the property distinguishing these models is their cardinality — a property which can not be defined within the system '' set theory and its philosophy , a critical introduction s.6 ; michael potter , oxford , 2004 a common attitude towards the axiomatic method is logicism in recursion theory , a collection of axioms is called recursive if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is a theorem an example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the natural numbers , which is only partially axiomatized by the peano axioms ( described below ) any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything

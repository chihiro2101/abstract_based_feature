in an axiomatic system , an axiom is called independent if it is not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system unlike consistency , independence is not a necessary requirement for a functioning axiomatic system — though it is usually sought after to minimize the number of axioms in the system an axiomatic system is called complete if for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable from the system 's axioms ( equivalently , every statement is capable of being proven true or false ) this describes the scenario where the undefined terms of a first axiom system are provided definitions from a second , such that the axioms of the first are theorems of the second lines and points are undefined terms ( also called primitive notions ) in absolute geometry , but assigned meanings in the theory of real numbers in a way that is consistent with both axiom systems a model for an axiomatic system is a well-defined set , which assigns meaning for the undefined terms presented in the system , in a manner that is correct with the relations defined in the system models can also be used to show the independence of an axiom in the system an axiomatic system for which every model is isomorphic to another is called categorial ( sometimes categorical ) however , the concept of an infinite set can not be defined within the system — let alone the cardinality of such as set the system has at least two different models – one is the natural numbers ( isomorphic to any other countably infinite set ) , and another is the real numbers ( isomorphic to any other set with the cardinality of the continuum ) in recursion theory , a collection of axioms is called recursive if a computer program can recognize whether a given proposition in the language is a theorem an example of such a body of propositions is the theory of the natural numbers , which is only partially axiomatized by the peano axioms ( described below ) any more-or-less arbitrarily chosen system of axioms is the basis of some mathematical theory , but such an arbitrary axiomatic system will not necessarily be free of contradictions , and even if it is , it is not likely to shed light on anything he chose the axioms , in the language of a single unary function symbol s ( short for '' successor '' ) , for the set of natural numbers to be : there is a natural number 0

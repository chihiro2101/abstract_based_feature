as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more ; education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence , education appears to be the '' most consistent , robust , and durable method '' known for raising intelligence ; motivation motivation is a factor that influences the results of the iq test in psychology , human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence according to psychologist wayne weiten , '' iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense , the validity of iq tests is questionable he argues that psychometric ( iq ) tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence article in wikipedia : intelligence : knowns and unknowns a major criticism of gardner 's theory is that it has never been tested , or subjected to peer review , by gardner or anyone else , and indeed that it is unfalsifiable '' howard gardner describes his first seven intelligences as follows : linguistic intelligence : people high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words , both spoken and written spatial intelligence : the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model physical intelligence : the ability to solve problems or to fashion products using one 's whole body , or parts of the body gifted people in this intelligence may be good dancers , athletes , surgeons , craftspeople , and others interpersonal intelligence : the ability to see things from the perspective of others , or to understand people in the sense of empathy triarchic theory of intelligence robert sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence : analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context the processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence : adapting to , shaping of , and selecting of one 's environments sternberg 's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community attempts to raise iq with brain training have led to increases on aspects related with the training tasks – for instance working memory – but it is yet unclear if these increases generalize to increased intelligence per se a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence ( gf ) , as measured in several different standard tests for example , the progressive nature of raven 's advanced progressive matrices ( apm ) test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions ( i.e transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes in the same vein , collective intelligence research aims to discover a ‘ c factor ’ explaining between-group differences in performance as well as structural and group compositional causes for it creative intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations intelligence and culture , robert serpell , handbook of intelligence , cambridge university press , 2000 , pp

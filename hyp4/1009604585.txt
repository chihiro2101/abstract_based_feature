as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more ; education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence , education appears to be the '' most consistent , robust , and durable method '' known for raising intelligence in one cross-sectional study , various cognitive functions measured declines by about 0.8 in z-score from age 20 to age 50 , the cognitive functions included speed of processing , working memory , and long-term memory ; genes a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human dna are correlated with intelligence in psychology , human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence according to psychologist wayne weiten , '' iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work schmidt and hunter ( 2004 ) suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability , or '' g '' , has not received empirical support on the other hand , jerome bruner agreed with gardner that the intelligences were '' useful fictions '' , and went on to state that '' his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered spatial intelligence : the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model musical intelligence : those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch , and may even be absolute pitch intrapersonal intelligence : it is a capacity to form an accurate , veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence : analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly , but not entirely , novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context the processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence : adapting to , shaping of , and selecting of one 's environments the mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one 's strengths and compensating or correcting for one 's weaknesses sternberg 's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence ( gf ) , as measured in several different standard tests ( 2008 ) , improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , vol , 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45-minute test ) a meta analysis shows omega 3 fatty acids improves cognitive performance among those with cognitive deficits , but not among healthy subjects eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history , falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii a recent scientific understanding of collective intelligence , defined as a group 's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks , expands the areas of human intelligence research applying similar methods and concepts to groups the american psychological association 's report '' intelligence : knowns and unknowns '' stated that iq tests do correlate and that the view that g is a statistical artifact is a minority one to negate this , psychologists offer the following definitions of intelligence : successful intelligence is the skills and knowledge needed for success in life , according to one 's own definition of success , within one 's sociocultural context a chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others â€” although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in china

as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more ; education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence , education appears to be the '' most consistent , robust , and durable method '' known for raising intelligence ; genes a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human dna are correlated with intelligence in psychology , human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence according to psychologist wayne weiten , '' iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense , the validity of iq tests is questionable gardner breaks intelligence down into at least a number of different components in the first edition of his book frames of mind ( 1983 ) , he described seven distinct types of intelligence—logical-mathematical , linguistic , spatial , musical , kinesthetic , interpersonal , and intrapersonal locke , 2005 ) have suggested that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence ( specific aptitude theory ) implies a political—rather than scientific—agenda , intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals , rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities '' howard gardner describes his first seven intelligences as follows : linguistic intelligence : people high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words , both spoken and written spatial intelligence : the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model musical intelligence : those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch , and may even be absolute pitch physical intelligence : the ability to solve problems or to fashion products using one 's whole body , or parts of the body strong interpersonal intelligence would be an asset in those who are teachers , politicians , clinicians , religious leaders , etc intrapersonal intelligence : it is a capacity to form an accurate , veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence : analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context success is achieved by using combinations of analytical , creative , and practical intelligence sternberg 's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence ( gf ) , as measured in several different standard tests a meta-regression shows omega 3 fatty acids improve the moods of patients with major depression ( major depression is associated with mental deficits ) he interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that , to a larger or smaller degree , influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems creative intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to relatively novel tasks and situations although typically identified by its western definition , multiple studies support the idea that human intelligence carries different meanings across cultures around the world a chinese conception of intelligence would define it as the ability to empathize with and understand others — although this is by no means the only way that intelligence is defined in china

as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more ; education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence , education appears to be the '' most consistent , robust , and durable method '' known for raising intelligence ; genes a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human dna are correlated with intelligence in psychology , human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests however , while iq test scores show a high degree of inter-test reliability , and predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively , their construct validity as a holistic measure of human intelligence is considered dubious while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence according to psychologist wayne weiten , '' iq tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense , the validity of iq tests is questionable in the first edition of his book frames of mind ( 1983 ) , he described seven distinct types of intelligenceâ€”logical-mathematical , linguistic , spatial , musical , kinesthetic , interpersonal , and intrapersonal '' howard gardner describes his first seven intelligences as follows : linguistic intelligence : people high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words , both spoken and written logical-mathematical intelligence : it implies logical and mathematical abilities spatial intelligence : the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model gifted people in this intelligence may be good dancers , athletes , surgeons , craftspeople , and others intrapersonal intelligence : it is a capacity to form an accurate , veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life robert sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence : analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to , selection of , and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor ; instead , the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence , and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood more recently , the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed as the theory of successful intelligence by sternberg intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context success is achieved by using combinations of analytical , creative , and practical intelligence sternberg 's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community ( 2008 ) , improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , vol thumb the approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms , none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests one comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks has found that the raven 's progressive matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks crystallized intelligence ( gc ) : includes the breadth and depth of a person 's acquired knowledge , the ability to communicate one 's knowledge , and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures analytical intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to fairly abstract but familiar kinds of problems intelligence and culture , robert serpell , handbook of intelligence , cambridge university press , 2000 , pp

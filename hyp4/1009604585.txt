as a construct and measured by measuring , intelligence is considered to be one of the most useful concepts used in psychology , because it correlates with many relevant variables , for instance the probability of suffering an accident , salary , and more ; education according to a 2018 metastudy of educational effects on intelligence , education appears to be the '' most consistent , robust , and durable method '' known for raising intelligence in psychology , human intelligence is commonly assessed by iq scores that are determined by iq tests while iq tests are generally understood to measure some forms of intelligence , they may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of human intelligence inclusive of creativity and social intelligence but if the purpose is to assess intelligence in a broader sense , the validity of iq tests is questionable gardner breaks intelligence down into at least a number of different components in the first edition of his book frames of mind ( 1983 ) , he described seven distinct types of intelligenceâ€”logical-mathematical , linguistic , spatial , musical , kinesthetic , interpersonal , and intrapersonal article in wikipedia : intelligence : knowns and unknowns a major criticism of gardner 's theory is that it has never been tested , or subjected to peer review , by gardner or anyone else , and indeed that it is unfalsifiable logical-mathematical intelligence : it implies logical and mathematical abilities spatial intelligence : the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model musical intelligence : those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch , and may even be absolute pitch gifted people in this intelligence may be good dancers , athletes , surgeons , craftspeople , and others interpersonal intelligence : the ability to see things from the perspective of others , or to understand people in the sense of empathy intrapersonal intelligence : it is a capacity to form an accurate , veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence : analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed intelligence is now defined as an individual 's assessment of success in life by the individual 's own ( idiographic ) standards and within the individual 's sociocultural context a 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence ( gf ) , as measured in several different standard tests ( 2008 ) , improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , vol substances which actually or purportedly improve intelligence or other mental functions are called nootropics however , exercise , not just performance-enhancing drugs , enhances cognition for healthy and non healthy subjects as well transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history , falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii thumb the approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing there are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude there are many different kinds of iq tests using a wide variety of test tasks some tests consist of a single type of task , others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents ( visual-spatial , verbal , numerical ) and asking for different cognitive processes ( e.g kaufman , 2009 , springer publishing company , fluid intelligence ( gf ) : includes the broad ability to reason , form concepts , and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures practical intelligence is the result of intelligence 's components applied to experience for purposes of adaption , shaping and selection intelligence and culture , robert serpell , handbook of intelligence , cambridge university press , 2000 , pp

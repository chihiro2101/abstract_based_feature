modern debate about the identity of the '' saka '' is partly from ambiguous usage of the word by ancient , non-saka authorities according to herodotus , the persians gave the name '' saka '' to all '' scythians '' herodotus , vii.64 however , pliny the elder ( gaius plinius secundus , ad 23–79 ) claims that the persians gave the name sakai only to the scythian tribes '' nearest to them '' 50 the scythians to the far north of assyria were also called the saka suni ( saka or scythian sons ) by the persians another people , the gimirrai , who were known to the ancient greece as the cimmerians , were closely associated with the sakas 378 these people were reported to be mainly interested in settling in the kingdom of urartu , later part of armenia , and shacusen in utik derived its name from them ) the behistun inscription initially only gave one entry for saka , they were however further differentiated later into three groups : the sakā paradraya – '' saka beyond the sea '' , a name added after the scythian campaign of darius i north of the danube the sakā tigraxaudā – '' saka with pointy hats/caps '' the sakā haumavargā – interpreted as '' haoma-drinking saka '' , but there are other suggestions both the sakā tigraxaudā and sakā haumavargā are thought to be located in central asia east of the caspian sea sakā haumavargā is considered to be the same as amyrgians , the saka tribe in closest proximity to bactria and sogdia sakā and skuthai evidently constituted a generic name for the nomads on the northern frontiers '' persian sources often treat them as a single tribe called the saka ( sakai or sakas ) , but greek and latin texts suggest that the scythians were composed of many sub-groups journal of the royal asiatic society of great britain & ireland by royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland-page-323 modern scholars now usually use the term saka to refer to iranian peoples who inhabited the northern and eastern eurasian steppe and the tarim basin the sakas were a group of iranic peoples who spoke a language belonging to the iranian branch of the indo-european languages french historian rené grousset wrote that they formed a particular branch of the '' sarmatians '' originating from nomadic iranian peoples of the northwestern steppe in eurasia '' the pazyryk burials of the pazyryk culture in the ukok plateau in the 4th and 3rd centuries bc are thought to be of saka chieftains '' the rich kurgan burials in pazyryk , siberia probably were those of saka chieftains '' '' analysis of the clothing , which has analogies in the complex of saka clothes , particularly in pazyryk , led wang binghua ( 1987 , 42 ) to the conclusion that they are related to the saka culture and ak-alakha '' these burials show striking similarities with the earlier tarim mummies at gumugou the issyk kurgan of south-eastern kazakhstan , and the ordos culture of the ordos plateau has also been connected with the saka '' their royal tribes and kings ( shan-yii ) bore iranian names and all the hsiung-nu words noted by the chinese can be explained from an iranian language of saka type it is therefore clear that the majority of hsiung-nu tribes spoke an eastern iranian language '' some scholars contend that in the 8th century bc , a saka raid on altai may be '' connected '' with a raid on zhou china the saka are attested in historical and archaeological records dating to around the 8th century bc two saka tribes named in the behistun inscription , sakā tigraxaudā ( '' saka with pointy hats/caps '' ) and the sakā haumavargā ( '' haoma-drinking saka '' ) , may be located to the east of the caspian sea some argued that the sakā haumavargā may be the sakā para sugdam , therefore sakā haumavargā would be located further east than the sakā tigraxaudā some argued for the pamirs or xinjiang as their location , although jaxartes is considered to be their more likely location given that the name says '' beyond sogdiana '' rather than bactria the contemporary greek historian herodotus noted that the achaemenid empire called all of the '' scythians '' by the name '' saka '' greek historians wrote of the wars between the saka and the medes , as well as their wars against cyrus the great of the persian achaemenid empire where saka women were said to fight alongside their men darius i also waged wars against the eastern sakas , who fought him with three armies led by three kings according to polyaenus in 520–519 bc , darius i defeated the sakā tigraxaudā tribe and captured their king skunkha ( depicted as wearing a pointed hat in behistun ) the territories of saka were absorbed into the achaemenid empire as part of chorasmia that included much of the amu darya ( oxus ) and the syr darya ( jaxartes ) , and the saka then supplied the achaemenid army with large number of mounted bowmen '' the ethnonym saka appears in ancient iranian and indian sources as the name of the large family of iranian nomads called scythians by the classical western sources and sai by the chinese ( gk around 30 saka tombs in the form of kurgans ( burial mounds ) have also been found in the tian shan area dated to between 550–250 bc indications of saka presence have also been found in the tarim basin region , possibly as early as the 7th century bc at least by the late 2nd century bc , the sakas had founded states in the tarim

they settled in kashmir , and eastward , to settle in some of the oasis-states of tarim basin sites , like yanqi ( 焉耆 , karasahr ) and qiuci ( 龜茲 , kucha ) yu taishan ( june 2010 ) , '' the earliest

ancient greco-roman geographer strabo noted that the four tribes that took down the bactrians in the greek and roman account – the asii , pasianoi , tokharoi and sakaraulai – came from land north of the syr darya where the ili and chu valleys are located rené grousset wrote of the migration of the saka : '' the saka , under pressure from the yueh-chih yuezhi , overran sogdiana and then bactria , there taking the place of the greeks '' chinese history – sai 塞 the saka people or soghdians mair speculate that some sakas may also have migrated to the area of yunnan in southern china following

third-century ad documents in prakrit from nearby shanshan record the title for the king of khotan as hinajha ( i.e this , along with the fact that the king 's recorded regnal periods were given as the khotanese kṣuṇa , '' implies an established connection between the iranian inhabitants and the royal power , '' according to the professor of iranian studies ronald e '' furthermore , he argued that the early form of the name of khotan , hvatana , is connected semantically with the name saka modern scholarly consensus is that the eastern iranian language ancestral to the pamir languages in central asia and the medieval saka language of xinjiang , was one of the scythian languages sakas of the tasmola culture were found to be of about 56 % wsh ancestry and 44 % siberian hunter-gather

modern debate about the identity of the '' saka '' is partly from ambiguous usage of the word by ancient , non-saka authorities according to herodotus , the persians gave the name '' saka '' to all '' scythians '' herodotus , vii.64 however , pliny the elder ( gaius plinius secundus , ad 23–79 ) claims that the persians gave the name sakai only to the scythian tribes '' nearest to them '' 50 the scythians to the far north of assyria were also called the saka suni ( saka or scythian sons ) by the persians the neo-assyrian empire of the time of esarhaddon record campaigning against a people they called in the akkadian language the ashkuza or ishhuza 378 these people were reported to be mainly interested in settling in the kingdom of urartu , later part of armenia , and shacusen in utik derived its name from them the sakā tigraxaudā – '' saka with pointy hats/caps '' the sakā haumavargā – interpreted as '' haoma-drinking saka '' , but there are other suggestions the sakā paradraya refers to the western scythians ( european scythians ) or sarmatians both the sakā tigraxaudā and sakā haumavargā are thought to be located in central asia east of the caspian sea sakā haumavargā is considered to be the same as amyrgians , the saka tribe in closest proximity to bactria and sogdia in the modern era , the archaeologist hugo winckler ( 1863–1913 ) was the first to associate the sakas with the scythians sakā and skuthai evidently constituted a generic name for the nomads on the northern frontiers '' persian sources often treat them as a single tribe called the saka ( sakai or sakas ) , but greek and latin texts suggest that the scythians were composed of many sub-groups journal of the royal asiatic society of great britain & ireland by royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland-page-323 modern scholars now usually use the term saka to refer to iranian peoples who inhabited the northern and eastern eurasian steppe and the tarim basin the sakas were a group of iranic peoples who spoke a language belonging to the iranian branch of the indo-european languages like the scythians of the pontic steppe , to whom they were related , the saka were racially europoid and ultimately traced their origin to the andronovo culture '' the rich kurgan burials in pazyryk , siberia probably were those of saka chieftains '' '' analysis of the clothing , which has analogies in the complex of saka clothes , particularly in pazyryk , led wang binghua ( 1987 , 42 ) to the conclusion that they are related to the saka culture '' their royal tribes and kings ( shan-yii ) bore iranian names and all the hsiung-nu words noted by the chinese can be explained from an iranian language of saka type it is therefore clear that the majority of hsiung-nu tribes spoke an eastern iranian language '' some scholars contend that in the 8th century bc , a saka raid on altai may be '' connected '' with a raid on zhou china the saka are attested in historical and archaeological records dating to around the 8th century bc 522-486 bc ) , the saka are said to have lived just beyond the borders of sogdia some argued that the sakā haumavargā may be the sakā para sugdam , therefore sakā haumavargā would be located further east than the sakā tigraxaudā some argued for the pamirs or xinjiang as their location , although jaxartes is considered to be their more likely location given that the name says '' beyond sogdiana '' rather than bactria the contemporary greek historian herodotus noted that the achaemenid empire called all of the '' scythians '' by the name '' saka '' according to herodotus , cyrus the great confronted the massagetae , a people related to the saka , while campaigning to the east of the caspian sea and was killed in the battle in 530 bc darius i also waged wars against the eastern sakas , who fought him with three armies led by three kings according to polyaenus in 520–519 bc , darius i defeated the sakā tigraxaudā tribe and captured their king skunkha ( depicted as wearing a pointed hat in behistun ) the territories of saka were absorbed into the achaemenid empire as part of chorasmia that included much of the amu darya ( oxus ) and the syr darya ( jaxartes ) , and the saka then supplied the achaemenid army with large number of mounted bowmen they were also mentioned as among those who resisted alexander the great 's incursions into central asia the saka were known as the sak or sai in ancient chinese records '' these records indicate that they originally inhabited the ili and chu river valleys of modern kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan the exact date of the sakas ' arrival in the valleys of the ili and chu in central asia is unclear , perhaps it was just before the reign of darius i indications of saka presence have also been found in the tarim basin region , possibly as early as the 7th century bc at least by the late 2nd century bc , the sakas had founded states in the tarim barin the saka were pushed out of the ili and chu river valleys by the yuezhi '' han foreign relations , '' in the cambridge history of china : volume i : the ch'in and han empires , 221 bc – a.d the rise of the chinese

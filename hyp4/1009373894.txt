modern debate about the identity of the '' saka '' is partly from ambiguous usage of the word by ancient , non-saka authorities according to herodotus , the persians gave the name '' saka '' to all '' scythians '' herodotus , vii.64 however , pliny the elder ( gaius plinius secundus , ad 23–79 ) claims that the persians gave the name sakai only to the scythian tribes '' nearest to them '' pliny the elder , natural history , vi 50 the scythians to the far north of assyria were also called the saka suni ( saka or scythian sons ) by the persians the neo-assyrian empire of the time of esarhaddon record campaigning against a people they called in the akkadian language the ashkuza or ishhuza in biblical hebrew , the ashkuz ( ashkenaz ) are considered to be a direct offshoot from the gimirri ( gomer ) the sakā tigraxaudā – '' saka with pointy hats/caps '' the sakā haumavargā – interpreted as '' haoma-drinking saka '' , but there are other suggestions both the sakā tigraxaudā and sakā haumavargā are thought to be located in central asia east of the caspian sea sakā and skuthai evidently constituted a generic name for the nomads on the northern frontiers the sakas were a group of iranic peoples who spoke a language belonging to the iranian branch of the indo-european languages '' the physical type of this group , distinctly mongoloid , is also very different from the europoid '' saka '' people of the altai '' the pazyryk burials of the pazyryk culture in the ukok plateau in the 4th and 3rd centuries bc are thought to be of saka chieftains '' the rich kurgan burials in pazyryk , siberia probably were those of saka chieftains '' '' analysis of the clothing , which has analogies in the complex of saka clothes , particularly in pazyryk , led wang binghua ( 1987 , 42 ) to the conclusion that they are related to the saka culture the issyk kurgan of south-eastern kazakhstan , and the ordos culture of the ordos plateau has also been connected with the saka it has been suggested that the ruling elite of the xiongnu was of saka origin '' their royal tribes and kings ( shan-yii ) bore iranian names and all the hsiung-nu words noted by the chinese can be explained from an iranian language of saka type '' some scholars contend that in the 8th century bc , a saka raid on altai may be '' connected '' with a raid on zhou china in the achaemenid-era old persian inscriptions found at persepolis , dated to the reign of darius i ( r 522-486 bc ) , the saka are said to have lived just beyond the borders of sogdia likewise an inscription dated to the reign of xerxes i ( r two saka tribes named in the behistun inscription , sakā tigraxaudā ( '' saka with pointy hats/caps '' ) and the sakā haumavargā ( '' haoma-drinking saka '' ) , may be located to the east of the caspian sea some argued that the sakā haumavargā may be the sakā para sugdam , therefore sakā haumavargā would be located further east than the sakā tigraxaudā some argued for the pamirs or xinjiang as their location , although jaxartes is considered to be their more likely location given that the name says '' beyond sogdiana '' rather than bactria the contemporary greek historian herodotus noted that the achaemenid empire called all of the '' scythians '' by the name '' saka '' according to herodotus , cyrus the great confronted the massagetae , a people related to the saka , while campaigning to the east of the caspian sea and was killed in the battle in 530 bc in 520–519 bc , darius i defeated the sakā tigraxaudā tribe and captured their king skunkha ( depicted as wearing a pointed hat in behistun ) '' the ethnonym saka appears in ancient iranian and indian sources as the name of the large family of iranian nomads called scythians by the classical western sources and sai by the chinese ( gk '' these records indicate that they originally inhabited the ili and chu river valleys of modern kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan the exact date of the sakas ' arrival in the valleys of the ili and chu in central asia is unclear , perhaps it was just before the reign of darius i around 30 saka tombs in the form of kurgans ( burial mounds ) have also been found in the tian shan area dated to between 550–250 bc indications of saka presence have also been found in the tarim basin region , possibly as early as the 7th century bc at least by the late 2nd century bc , the sakas had founded states in the tarim barin '' han foreign relations , '' in the cambridge history of china : volume i : the ch'in and han empires , 221 bc – a.d cambridge : cambridge university

fleeing the yuezhi attacked the parthian empire , where they defeated and killed the kings phraates ii and artabanus '' chinese history – sai 塞 the saka people or soghdians mair speculate that some sakas may also have migrated to the area of yunnan in southern china following their expulsion by the yuezhi excavations of the prehistoric art of the dian kingdom of yunnan have revealed hunting scenes of caucasoid horsemen in central asian clothing animal scenes of felines attacking oxen are also at times reminiscent of scythian art both in theme and in composition migrations of the 2nd and 1st century bc have left traces in sogdia and bactria , but they can not firmly be attributed to the saka , similarly with the sites of sirkap and taxila in ancient india the shakya clan of india , to which gautama buddha , called śākyamuni '' sage of the shakyas '' , belonged , were also likely sakas , as michael witzel and christopher i the region in modern afghanistan and iran where the saka moved to became known as '' land of the saka '' or sakastan this is attested in a contemporary kharosthi inscription found on the mathura lion capital belonging to the saka kingdom of the indo-scythians ( 200 bc – 400 ad ) in northern india , bailey , h.w in the 11th century , according to mahmud al-kashgari , some non-turkic languages like the kanchaki and sogdian were still used in some areas in the vicinity of kashgar , and kanchaki is thought to belong to the saka language group tian shan sakas were found to be of about 70 % western steppe herder ( wsh ) ancestry , 25 % siberian hunter-gatherer ancestry and 5 % iranian neolithic ancestry one particular tribe of sakas ( the saka tigraxaudā ) wore pointed caps '' asian saka headgear is clearly visible on the persepolis

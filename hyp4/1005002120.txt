baretti was intended by his father for the profession of law , but at the age of sixteen fled from turin and went to guastalla , where he was for some time employed in a mercantile house he devoted himself to the study of literature and criticism , in which he became an expert , though his writings were so controversial that he had to leave italy for many years he led a wandering life , supporting himself chiefly by his writings at length he arrived in london , where he remained for the remainder of his life ( when not travelling ) baretti was a frequent visitor at the home of hester thrale , and his name occurs repeatedly in boswell 's life in 1769 baretti was tried for murder after inflicting a mortal wound with his fruit knife on a man who had assaulted him on the street johnson and others gave evidence in his favour at the trial , which resulted in baretti 's acquittal while in italy on his travels baretti started a journal of literary criticism , titled frusta letteraria ( literary scourge ) his many other works include a dictionary and grammar of the italian language , a similar dictionary of the spanish language , baretti , joseph , ( 1807 ) a dictionary , spanish and english , and english and spanish , containing the signification of their words and their different uses ; together with the terms of arts , sciences , and trades in a trial at the old bailey on 18 october 1769 , baretti was accused of having stabbed morgan and was charged with murder baretti did not walk to the prison , instead a coach was called and once there he paid for a private room , where he had also some food and drinks in this trial baretti was called with the english name joseph however , in these accounts and transcriptions of what was said in court we do not find everything the proceedings – publishing history of the proceedings , old bailey proceedings online ( www.oldbaileyonline.org , version 7.0 , 10 december 2015 ) one of them asked baretti how he could strike a woman and then a scuffle followed , baretti ending up on the ground she also said that then baretti ran away and they ran after him she saw him going into a shop in panton street she was asked also more and more details , for example where the other woman put her hands when grabbing baretti , and she answered she put them towards his private parts the court asked if baretti had been insulted , she firstly denied , then seemed to be unsure , and added at the end that maybe somebody called him bad names , but she did not know who the second person to testify was thomas patman , one of the three men who came up at the haymarket patman said he was pushed against baretti , who gave him a stab wound : '' i received a blow from him directly on my left side : the blood ran down into my shoe '' he said also that morgan ran after baretti and was struck by him too in particular he was asked about the stabbings , how , when , where they happened and he claimed morgan was stabbed in panton street however , there seemed to be some inconsistencies about when it happened : during the trial clark said morgan was stabbed after patman , but during the examination by the magistrate and coroner he had said morgan was the first to be stabbed as we read from the proceedings there were other several gentlemen who were there to testify for baretti 's good character , but the court did not think it necessary to call them all baretti , giuseppe marc'antonio ( 1719–1789 )

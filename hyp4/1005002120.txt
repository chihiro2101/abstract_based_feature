baretti was intended by his father for the profession of law , but at the age of sixteen fled from turin and went to guastalla , where he was for some time employed in a mercantile house at length he arrived in london , where he remained for the remainder of his life ( when not travelling ) baretti was a frequent visitor at the home of hester thrale , and his name occurs repeatedly in boswell 's life in 1769 baretti was tried for murder after inflicting a mortal wound with his fruit knife on a man who had assaulted him on the street johnson and others gave evidence in his favour at the trial , which resulted in baretti 's acquittal while in italy on his travels baretti started a journal of literary criticism , titled frusta letteraria ( literary scourge ) his many other works include a dictionary and grammar of the italian language , a similar dictionary of the spanish language , baretti , joseph , ( 1807 ) on 6 october 1769 baretti was involved in a scuffle at the haymarket , an area which was notorious as a place of prostitution and frequented by footpads , with many coffeehouses and shops this quarrel caused the death of a man , evan morgan in a trial at the old bailey on 18 october 1769 , baretti was accused of having stabbed morgan and was charged with murder baretti did not walk to the prison , instead a coach was called and once there he paid for a private room , where he had also some food and drinks in this trial baretti was called with the english name joseph however , in these accounts and transcriptions of what was said in court we do not find everything the trial opened with the testimony of elizabeth ward , a well-known prostitute who described when and where the events started she said in that moment there was nobody around , but when she cried out three men arrived , namely evan morgan , thomas patman and john clark one of them asked baretti how he could strike a woman and then a scuffle followed , baretti ending up on the ground she also said that then baretti ran away and they ran after him in cross-examination she was asked to give more information about the woman who was with her and ward said she did not know her , but could only describe her physically she was asked also more and more details , for example where the other woman put her hands when grabbing baretti , and she answered she put them towards his private parts the court asked if baretti had been insulted , she firstly denied , then seemed to be unsure , and added at the end that maybe somebody called him bad names , but she did not know who he said also that morgan ran after baretti and was struck by him too he then also added that somedoby then collared baretti and he stated he thought it was morgan himself john lambert testified as he was the constable who apprehended baretti what we find next are a series of testimonies of baretti 's friends or acquaintances , who all testify for him they also affirmed it was common for them too , to use and carry knives such as the one baretti had , confirming in this way the explanation baretti had previously given as we read from the proceedings there were other several gentlemen who were there to testify for baretti 's good character , but the court did not think it necessary to call them all the death was caused by one of the three wounds baretti gave him with his knife

the administrative machinery in the vedic india was headed by a tribal king called rajan whose position was not hereditary.the king was elected in a tribal assembly ( called samiti ) which included women.the rajan protected the tribe and cattle ; was assisted by a priest ; and did not maintain a standing army , though in the later period the rulership appears to have risen as a class some scholars consider the purusha sukta to be a late interpolation into the rigveda based on the neological character of the composition , as compared to the more archaic style of the vedic literature an alternate explanation is that the word 'shudra ' does not occur anywhere else in the rig-veda except the purusha sukta , leading some scholars to believe the purusha sukta was a composition of the later rig-vedic period itself to denote , legitimize and sanctify an oppressive and exploitative class structure that had already come into existence although the purusha sukta uses the term rajanya , not kshatriya , it is considered the first instance in the extant vedic texts where four social classes are mentioned for the first time together usage of the term rajanya possibly indicates the 'kinsmen of the rajan ' ( i.e , kinsmen of the ruler ) had emerged as a distinct social group then , such that by the end of the vedic period , the term rajanya was replaced by kshatriya ; where rajanya stresses kinship with the rajan and kshatriya denotes power over a specific domain the term rajanya unlike the word kshatriya essentially denoted the status within a lineage jaiswal points out the term brahman rarely occurs in the rig-veda with the exception of the purusha sukta and may not have been used for the priestly class in the panchavimsha brahmana ( 13,4,7 ) , the rajanya are placed first , followed by brahmana then vaishya

the hymn purusha sukta to the rigveda describes the symbolic creation of the four varna-s through cosmic sacrifice ( yaj√±a ) some scholars consider the purusha sukta to be a late interpolation into the rigveda based on the neological character of the composition , as compared to the more archaic style of the vedic literature since not all indians were fully regulated under the varna in the vedic society , david kean ( 2007 ) the purusha sukta was supposedly composed in order to secure vedic sanction for the heredity caste scheme an alternate explanation is that the word 'shudra ' does not occur anywhere else in the rig-veda except the purusha sukta , leading some scholars to believe the purusha sukta was a composition of the later rig-vedic period itself to denote , legitimize and sanctify an oppressive and exploitative class structure that had already come into existence although the purusha sukta uses the term rajanya , not kshatriya , it is considered the first instance in the extant vedic texts where four social classes are mentioned for the first time together jaiswal points out the term brahman rarely occurs in the rig-veda with the exception of the purusha sukta and may not have been used for the priestly class writing in the context of how the jajmani system operated in the 1960s , pauline kolenda noted that the '' caste function of the kshatriya is to lead and protect the village , and with conquest to manage their conquered lands in rituals , the nyagrodha ( ficus indica or india fig or banyan tree ) danda , or staff , is assigned to the kshatriya class , along with a mantra , intended to impart physical vitality or 'ojas'

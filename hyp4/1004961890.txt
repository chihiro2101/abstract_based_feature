polynesian languages fall into two branches , tongic and nuclear polynesian tongan and niuean constitute the tongic branch ; all the rest are part of the nuclear polynesian branch pawley , andrew , 1966 , polynesian languages : a subgrouping based upon shared innovations in morphology , 1953 , internal relationships of polynesian languages and dialects southwestern journal of anthropology 9 ( 2 ) :147–173 , 1963 , east polynesian relationships : settlement pattern and time involved as indicated by vocabulary agreements since pawley 's 1966 publication , inferring the ancient relationships of the polynesian languages and the proofs of shared innovations journal of the polynesian society 76 ( 3 ) :259–296 it began the process of extracting relationships from polynesian languages on small islands in melanesia , the '' polynesian outliers '' , whose languages pawley was able to trace to east futuna in the case of those farther south and perhaps to samoa itself in the case of those more to the north except for some minor differentiation of the east polynesian tree , further study paused for almost twenty years until wilson wilson , william h published a study of polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the east polynesian languages and all other nuclear polynesian but for futunic , and calling that extra-futunic group the '' ellicean languages '' this was made possible by the massive polynesian language comparative lexicon ( '' pollex '' – with reconstructions ) of biggs and clark biggs , bruce ( 1990 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 ) and bruce biggs and ross clark ( 1996 ) , pollex : comparative polynesian lexicon ( computer data base ) wilson 's new work brings the matter to the approximate limits of current data available , incorporating much data unknown to most other researchers massive lexicostatistical study of austronesian , for instance , showed a great deal of ( lexicostatistical ) diversity in the austronesian languages of western melanesia partly because polynesian languages split from one another comparatively recently , many words in these languages remain similar to corresponding words in others ʻokina – a glyph shaped like ( but distinct from ) an apostrophe : used to represent the glottal-stop consonant in some polynesian latin-based scripts

polynesian languages fall into two branches , tongic and nuclear polynesian tongan and niuean constitute the tongic branch ; all the rest are part of the nuclear polynesian branch pawley , andrew , 1966 , polynesian languages : a subgrouping based upon shared innovations in morphology , 1953 , internal relationships of polynesian languages and dialects , 1963 , east polynesian relationships : settlement pattern and time involved as indicated by vocabulary agreements that squarely suggested a '' west polynesian '' group composed of at least tongan and samoan and that an '' east polynesian '' group was equally distant from both tongan and samoan since pawley 's 1966 publication , inferring the ancient relationships of the polynesian languages and the proofs of shared innovations except for some minor differentiation of the east polynesian tree , further study paused for almost twenty years until wilson wilson , william h published a study of polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the east polynesian languages and all other nuclear polynesian but for futunic , and calling that extra-futunic group the '' ellicean languages '' furthermore , east polynesian was found to more likely have emerged from extra-samoan ellicean than out of samoa itself , an astonishing suggestion given the long assumption of a samoan homeland for the origins of east polynesian this was made possible by the massive polynesian language comparative lexicon ( '' pollex '' – with reconstructions ) of biggs and clark pawley , andrew ( 2009 ) polynesian paradoxes : subgroups , wave models and the dialect geography of proto polynesian on the matter of ellicean internal relations the western oceanic melanesian '' diversity '' of lexicostatistical studies was never of any interest in terms of attributing any special time depth or subgrouping significance to it most polynesian languages have five vowel qualities , corresponding roughly to those written i , e , a , o , u in classical latin proto-polynesian language – the reconstructed ancestral language from which modern polynesian languages are derived marck , jeff ( 2000 ) , topics in polynesian languages and culture history

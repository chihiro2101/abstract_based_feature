polynesian languages fall into two branches , tongic and nuclear polynesian tongan and niuean constitute the tongic branch ; all the rest are part of the nuclear polynesian branch nuclear polynesian ellicean ellicean–outlier tuvaluan nukuoro ( nukuoro in the federated states of micronesia ) kapingamarangi ( on kapingamarangi in federated states of micronesia ) nukuria ( nuguria in eastern papua new guinea ) marck , jeff ( 2000 ) , topics in polynesian languages and culture history the contemporary classification of the polynesian languages began with certain observations by andrew pawley in 1966 based on shared innovations in phonology , vocabulary and grammar showing that the east polynesian languages were more closely related to samoan than they were to tongan , calling tongan and its nearby relative niuean '' tongic '' and samoan and all other polynesian languages of the study '' nuclear polynesian '' pawley , andrew , 1966 , polynesian languages : a subgrouping based upon shared innovations in morphology previously , there had been only lexicostatistical studies elbert , samuel h journal of the polynesian society 72 ( 2 ) :78–100 pawley , andrew , 1967 , the relationships of polynesian outlier languages it began the process of extracting relationships from polynesian languages on small islands in melanesia , the '' polynesian outliers '' , whose languages pawley was able to trace to east futuna in the case of those farther south and perhaps to samoa itself in the case of those more to the north except for some minor differentiation of the east polynesian tree , further study paused for almost twenty years until wilson wilson , william h published a study of polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the east polynesian languages and all other nuclear polynesian but for futunic , and calling that extra-futunic group the '' ellicean languages '' biggs , bruce ( 1990 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 ) and bruce biggs and ross clark ( 1996 ) , pollex : comparative polynesian lexicon ( computer data base ) this was sometimes on par with the lexicostatistical distance of taiwan austronesian languages from other austronesian including taiwan austronesian languages from each other ( taiwan now definitively known to be the homeland of the language family itself ) they are just languages with accelerated loss of vocabulary , sometimes , in the western oceanic case , because they involve certain more ancient peoples of the region shifting to oceanic speech after oceanic-speaking peoples arrived the table below demonstrates this with the words for 'sky ' , 'north wind ' , 'woman ' , 'house ' and 'parent ' in a representative selection of languages : tongan ; niuean ; samoan ; sikaiana ; takuu ; rapanui language ; tahitian ; cook islands māori ( rarotongan ) ; māori ; north marquesan ; south marquesan ; hawaiian and mangarevan this is somewhat of an anomaly as the apostrophe is most often used to represent letters that have been omitted , while the glottal stop is rather a consonant that is not represented by a traditional latin letter hawaiʻian uses the ʻokina , also called by ʻokina names , a unicase consonant letter used within the latin script to mark the phoneme glottal stop

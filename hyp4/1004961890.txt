polynesian languages fall into two branches , tongic and nuclear polynesian tongan and niuean constitute the tongic branch ; all the rest are part of the nuclear polynesian branch pawley , andrew , 1966 , polynesian languages : a subgrouping based upon shared innovations in morphology , 1953 , internal relationships of polynesian languages and dialects , 1963 , east polynesian relationships : settlement pattern and time involved as indicated by vocabulary agreements that squarely suggested a '' west polynesian '' group composed of at least tongan and samoan and that an '' east polynesian '' group was equally distant from both tongan and samoan pawley , andrew , 1967 , the relationships of polynesian outlier languages except for some minor differentiation of the east polynesian tree , further study paused for almost twenty years until wilson wilson , william h , 1985 , evidence for an outlier source for the proto-eastern-polynesian pronominal system wilson named this new group '' ellicean '' after the pre-independence name of tuvalu and presented fine-grained evidence for subgroups within that overarching category this was made possible by the massive polynesian language comparative lexicon ( '' pollex '' â€“ with reconstructions ) of biggs and clark providing further evidence of fine grained subgroups within ellicean and a consideration of other recent work e.g pawley , andrew ( 2009 ) polynesian paradoxes : subgroups , wave models and the dialect geography of proto polynesian returning to lexicostatistics , it must be emphasised that the method does not make the best possible use of its short word lists of 100 or 200 words partly because polynesian languages split from one another comparatively recently , many words in these languages remain similar to corresponding words in others influenced by the traditions of orthographies of languages they were familiar with , the missionaries who first developed orthographies for unwritten polynesian languages did not explicitly mark phonemic vowel length or the glottal stop marck , jeff ( 2000 ) , topics in polynesian languages and culture history

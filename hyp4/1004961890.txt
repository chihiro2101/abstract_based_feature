polynesian languages fall into two branches , tongic and nuclear polynesian tongan and niuean constitute the tongic branch ; all the rest are part of the nuclear polynesian branch pawley , andrew , 1966 , polynesian languages : a subgrouping based upon shared innovations in morphology journal of the polynesian society 75 ( 1 ) :39–64 , 1953 , internal relationships of polynesian languages and dialects , 1963 , east polynesian relationships : settlement pattern and time involved as indicated by vocabulary agreements since pawley 's 1966 publication , inferring the ancient relationships of the polynesian languages and the proofs of shared innovations pawley , andrew , 1967 , the relationships of polynesian outlier languages except for some minor differentiation of the east polynesian tree , further study paused for almost twenty years until wilson wilson , william h published a study of polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the east polynesian languages and all other nuclear polynesian but for futunic , and calling that extra-futunic group the '' ellicean languages '' furthermore , east polynesian was found to more likely have emerged from extra-samoan ellicean than out of samoa itself , an astonishing suggestion given the long assumption of a samoan homeland for the origins of east polynesian this was made possible by the massive polynesian language comparative lexicon ( '' pollex '' – with reconstructions ) of biggs and clark biggs , bruce ( 1990 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 ) and bruce biggs and ross clark ( 1996 ) , pollex : comparative polynesian lexicon ( computer data base ) pawley , andrew ( 2009 ) polynesian paradoxes : subgroups , wave models and the dialect geography of proto polynesian this was sometimes on par with the lexicostatistical distance of taiwan austronesian languages from other austronesian including taiwan austronesian languages from each other ( taiwan now definitively known to be the homeland of the language family itself ) the glottal stop ( not present in all polynesian languages , but , where present , one of the most common consonants ) is indicated by an apostrophe , for example , ' a versus a ʻokina – a glyph shaped like ( but distinct from ) an apostrophe : used to represent the glottal-stop consonant in some polynesian latin-based scripts

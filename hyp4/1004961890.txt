polynesian languages fall into two branches , tongic and nuclear polynesian tongan and niuean constitute the tongic branch ; all the rest are part of the nuclear polynesian branch pawley , andrew , 1966 , polynesian languages : a subgrouping based upon shared innovations in morphology previously , there had been only lexicostatistical studies elbert , samuel h , 1963 , east polynesian relationships : settlement pattern and time involved as indicated by vocabulary agreements that squarely suggested a '' west polynesian '' group composed of at least tongan and samoan and that an '' east polynesian '' group was equally distant from both tongan and samoan since pawley 's 1966 publication , inferring the ancient relationships of the polynesian languages and the proofs of shared innovations pawley , andrew , 1967 , the relationships of polynesian outlier languages published a study of polynesian pronominal systems in 1985 suggesting that there was a special relationship between the east polynesian languages and all other nuclear polynesian but for futunic , and calling that extra-futunic group the '' ellicean languages '' marck , marck , jeff ( 2000 ) , topics in polynesian languages and culture history this was made possible by the massive polynesian language comparative lexicon ( '' pollex '' – with reconstructions ) of biggs and clark biggs , bruce ( 1990 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 ) and bruce biggs and ross clark ( 1996 ) , pollex : comparative polynesian lexicon ( computer data base ) the western oceanic melanesian '' diversity '' of lexicostatistical studies was never of any interest in terms of attributing any special time depth or subgrouping significance to it partly because polynesian languages split from one another comparatively recently , many words in these languages remain similar to corresponding words in others the latter method has come into common use in polynesian languages proto-polynesian language – the reconstructed ancestral language from which modern polynesian languages are derived polynesian languages , routledge and kegan paul lynch , j

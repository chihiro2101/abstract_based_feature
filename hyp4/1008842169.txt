the term laissez-faire likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful french controller-general of finances jean-baptiste colbert and a group of french businessmen headed by m when the eager mercantilism minister asked how the french state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce , le gendre replied simply : '' laissez-nous faire '' ( '' leave it to us '' or '' let us do it '' , the french verb not requiring an object ) the anecdote on the colbert–le gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the journal économique , written by french minister and champion of free trade rené de voyer , marquis d'argenson—also the first known appearance of the term in print d'argenson , '' lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de belloni ' , avril 1751 , journal oeconomique p quesnay coined the phrases laissez-faire and laissez-passer , laissez-faire being a translation of the chinese term wu wei ( 無為 ) gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in france turgot 's '' eloge de vincent de gournay , '' mercure , august , 1759 ( repr he forged it into a larger maxim all his own : '' laissez faire et laissez passer '' ( '' let do and let pass '' ) although gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas , he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries , notably his fellow physiocrats , who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and the doctrine to gournay gournay was credited with the phrase by jacques turgot ( '' eloge a gournay '' , mercure 1759 ) , the marquis de mirabeau ( philosophie rurale 1763 and ephémérides du citoyen , 1767 136–137 ) and dupont de nemours ( introduction to oeuvres de jacques turgot , 1808–11 , vol de boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase '' on laisse faire la nature '' ( '' let nature run its course '' ) '' tant , encore une fois , qu'on laisse faire la nature , on ne doit rien craindre de pareil '' , p.s however , gournay 's use of the laissez-faire phrase as popularized by the physiocrats gave it its cachet print it is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term laissez-faire is ordinarily associated since , in their view , this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government , they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty , to removing all artificial barriers to trade , and to abolishing all useless laws '' the french phrase laissez-faire gained currency in english-speaking countries with the spread of physiocratic literature in the late 18th century in spencer 's case , the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of laissez-faire in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right as a product of the enlightenment , laissez-faire was '' conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system , a system unhindered by the restrictions of government '' a political economy of lebanon 1948–2002 : the limits of laissez-faire smith saw laissez-faire as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of natural law with the advent of the anti-corn law league ( founded 1838 ) , the term received much of its english meaning smith first used the metaphor of an invisible hand in his book the theory of moral sentiments ( 1759 ) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest in political economy , that idea and the doctrine of laissez-faire have long been closely related smith , adam smith and the origins of american enterprise : how the founding fathers turned to a great economist 's writings and created the american economy , macmillan , 2004 , , pp notes a trend whereby recently '' conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term 'free-market capitalism ' in lieu of laissez-faire '' american individualist anarchists such as benjamin tucker saw themselves as economic laissez-faire socialists and political individualists while arguing that their '' anarchistic socialism '' or '' individual anarchism '' was '' consistent manchesterism '' in europe , the laissez-faire movement was first widely promoted by the physiocracy , a movement that included vincent de gournay ( 1712–1759 ) , a successful merchant turned political figure gournay held that government should allow the natural law to govern economic activity , with the state only intervening to protect life , liberty and property françois quesnay and anne robert jacques turgot , baron de l'aulne took up gournay 's ideas quesnay had the ear of the king of france , louis xv and in 1754 persuaded him to give laissez-faire a try the doctrine of laissez-faire became an integral part of classical liberalism just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere , so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics , seeing the state as merely a passive policeman , protecting private property and administering justice , but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in sweden , tuscany , spain and in the newly created united states however , the economist campaigned against the corn laws that protected landlords in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products a group that became known as the manchester liberals , to which richard cobden ( 1804–1865 ) and john bright ( 1811–1889 ) belonged , were staunch defenders of free trade the breakdown of laissez-faire as practised by the british empire was partly led by british companies eager for state support of their positions abroad , in particular british oil companies frank bourgin 's study of the constitutional convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the founding fathers the creation of a strong central government able to promote science , invention , industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of taxing and spending clause and making the economy of the united states strong enough for them to determine their own destiny others , including jefferson , view bourgin 's study , written in the 1940s and not published until 1989 , as an over-interpretation of the evidence , intended originally to defend the new deal and later to counter ronald reagan 's economic policies to the vast majority of american classical liberals , however , laissez-faire did not mean '' no government intervention '' at all for instance , the first national bank would not have reached the desk of president george washington in the absence of an agreement that was reached between alexander hamilton and several southern members of congress to locate the capitol in the district of columbia following hamilton 's death , the more abiding protectionism influence in the antebellum period came from henry clay and his american system in the early 19th century , '' it is quite clear that the laissez-faire label is an inappropriate one '' to apply to the relationship between the united states government and industry in the mid-19th century , the united states followed the whig tradition of economic nationalism , which included increased state control , regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure following world war i and the great depression , the united states turned to a mixed economy which combined free enterprise with a progressive tax and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect american industry from competition from overseas nivola wrote : '' by and large , the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high u.s 7 , new american library , signet , 1967 this viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of

market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality adam smith acknowledges some moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism according to smith , the landlords should be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations , but they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent-induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness

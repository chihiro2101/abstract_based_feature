'' ( '' let do and let pass , the world goes on by itself ! '' ) although gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas , he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries , notably his fellow physiocrats , who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and the doctrine to gournay gournay was credited with the phrase by jacques turgot ( '' eloge a gournay '' , mercure 1759 ) , the marquis de mirabeau ( philosophie rurale 1763 and ephémérides du citoyen , 1767 136–137 ) and dupont de nemours ( introduction to oeuvres de jacques turgot , 1808–11 , vol before d'argenson or gournay , p de boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase '' on laisse faire la nature '' ( '' let nature run its course '' ) de boisguilbert , 1707 , dissertation de la nature des richesses , de l'argent et des tributs however , gournay 's use of the laissez-faire phrase as popularized by the physiocrats gave it its cachet the physiocrats proclaimed laissez-faire in 18th-century france , placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists , beginning with adam smith , developed the idea print it is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term laissez-faire is ordinarily associated macgregor , economic thought and policy ( london , 1949 ) , pp since , in their view , this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government , they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty , to removing all artificial barriers to trade , and to abolishing all useless laws '' whatley 's principles of trade are reprinted in works of benjamin franklin , vol.2 , p in spencer 's case , the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of laissez-faire in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right in a similar vein , adam smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system for smith , laissez-faire was '' a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market , a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth '' however , smith and notable classical economics such as thomas malthus and david ricardo did not use the phrase with the advent of the anti-corn law league ( founded 1838 ) , the term received much of its english meaning smith first used the metaphor of an invisible hand in his book the theory of moral sentiments ( 1759 ) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self-interest smith , adam smith and the origins of american enterprise : how the founding fathers turned to a great economist 's writings and created the american economy , macmillan , 2004 , , pp notes a trend whereby recently '' conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term 'free-market capitalism ' in lieu of laissez-faire '' american individualist anarchists such as benjamin tucker saw themselves as economic laissez-faire socialists and political individualists while arguing that their '' anarchistic socialism '' or '' individual anarchism '' was '' consistent manchesterism '' in europe , the laissez-faire movement was first widely promoted by the physiocracy , a movement that included vincent de gournay ( 1712–1759 ) , a successful merchant turned political figure 3 '' the diffusion of wu-wei , co-evolved with the inner-european laissez-faire principle , the libaniusian model 8 '' thus , wu-wei has to be recognized as a laissez-faire instrument of chinese political economy '' p consequently , it is this variant of the laissez-faire maxim in which the basis of physiocracy 's 'moral philosophy ' is to be located 11 '' that wu-wei translates into french as laissez-faire '' gournay held that government should allow the natural law to govern economic activity , with the state only intervening to protect life , liberty and property just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere , so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics , seeing the state as merely a passive policeman , protecting private property and administering justice , but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in sweden , tuscany , spain and in the newly created united states in britain , the newspaper the economist ( founded in 1843 ) became an influential voice for laissez-faire capitalism in 1847 , referring to the famine then underway in ireland , founder of the economist james wilson wrote : '' it is no man 's business to provide for another '' however , the economist campaigned against the corn laws that protected landlords in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products the breakdown of laissez-faire as practised by the british empire was partly led by british companies eager for state support of their positions abroad , in particular british oil companies frank bourgin 's study of the constitutional convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the founding fathers others , including jefferson , view bourgin 's study , written in the 1940s and not published until 1989 , as an over-interpretation of the evidence , intended originally to defend the new deal and later to counter ronald reagan 's economic policies donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the united states had distinctive characteristics and that '' at the center of classical liberal theory in europe was the idea of laissez-faire most of the early opponents of laissez-faire capitalism in the united states subscribed to the american school in the mid-19th century , the united states followed the whig tradition of economic nationalism , which included increased state control , regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure the pacific railway acts provided the development of the first transcontinental railroad in order to help pay for its war effort in the civil war , the united states government imposed its first personal income tax on 5 august 1861 as part of the revenue act of 1861 ( 3 % of all incomes over us 800 ; rescinded in 1872 ) a more recent advocate of total laissez-faire has been objectivist ayn rand , who described it as '' the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade , the separation of state and economics , in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of church and state '' this viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation , which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights she worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics '' critics of laissez-faire as commonly understood argues that a truly laissez-faire system would be anti-capitalist and socialist the theoretical sections of carson 's studies in mutualist political economy are also presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism , a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality capitalism as a moral system : adam smith 's critique of the free market economy the british economist john maynard keynes condemned

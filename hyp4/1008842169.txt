the term laissez-faire likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful french controller-general of finances jean-baptiste colbert and a group of french businessmen headed by m when the eager mercantilism minister asked how the french state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce , le gendre replied simply : '' laissez-nous faire '' ( '' leave it to us '' or '' let us do it '' , the french verb not requiring an object ) the anecdote on the colbert–le gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the journal économique , written by french minister and champion of free trade rené de voyer , marquis d'argenson—also the first known appearance of the term in print d'argenson , '' lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de belloni ' , avril 1751 , journal oeconomique p quesnay coined the phrases laissez-faire and laissez-passer , laissez-faire being a translation of the chinese term wu wei ( 無為 ) gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in france he forged it into a larger maxim all his own : '' laissez faire et laissez passer '' ( '' let do and let pass '' ) his motto has also been identified as the longer '' laissez faire et laissez passer , le monde va de lui même ! '' ( '' let do and let pass , the world goes on by itself ! '' ) although gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas , he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries , notably his fellow physiocrats , who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and the doctrine to gournay gournay was credited with the phrase by jacques turgot ( '' eloge a gournay '' , mercure 1759 ) , the marquis de mirabeau ( philosophie rurale 1763 and ephémérides du citoyen , 1767 ) , the comte d'albon ( '' éloge historique de m de boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase '' on laisse faire la nature '' ( '' let nature run its course '' ) de boisguilbert , 1707 , dissertation de la nature des richesses , de l'argent et des tributs d'argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar , but less-celebrated motto '' pas trop gouverner '' ( '' govern not too much '' ) however , gournay 's use of the laissez-faire phrase as popularized by the physiocrats gave it its cachet the physiocrats proclaimed laissez-faire in 18th-century france , placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists , beginning with adam smith , developed the idea print it is with the physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term laissez-faire is ordinarily associated macgregor , economic thought and policy ( london , 1949 ) , pp the french phrase laissez-faire gained currency in english-speaking countries with the spread of physiocratic literature in the late 18th century as a product of the enlightenment , laissez-faire was '' conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system , a system unhindered by the restrictions of government '' in a similar vein , adam smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system for smith , laissez-faire was '' a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market , a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth '' however , smith and notable classical economics such as thomas malthus and david ricardo did not use the phrase jeremy bentham used the term , but it was probably james mill 's reference to the laissez-faire maxim ( together with the '' pas trop gouverner '' motto ) in an 1824 entry for the encyclopædia britannica that really brought the term into wider english usage smith , adam smith and the origins of american enterprise : how the founding fathers turned to a great economist 's writings and created the american economy , macmillan , 2004 , , pp notes a trend whereby recently '' conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term 'free-market capitalism ' in lieu of laissez-faire '' in europe , the laissez-faire movement was first widely promoted by the physiocracy , a movement that included vincent de gournay ( 1712–1759 ) , a successful merchant turned political figure consequently , it is this variant of the laissez-faire maxim in which the basis of physiocracy 's 'moral philosophy ' is to be located priddat 's work made clear that the wu-wei of the complete économie has to be considered central to physiocracy ; '' p françois quesnay and anne robert jacques turgot , baron de l'aulne took up gournay 's ideas in 1770 , the comptroller-general of finances joseph marie terray revoked the edict allowing free trade in grain just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere , so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics , seeing the state as merely a passive policeman , protecting private property and administering justice , but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens businessmen , british industrialists in particular , were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests adam smith , author of the wealth of nations ( 1776 ) , met quesnay and acknowledged his influence however , the economist campaigned against the corn laws that protected landlords in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products 344 however , repeal of the corn laws came too late to stop the irish famine , partly because it was done in stages over three years a group that became known as the manchester liberals , to which richard cobden ( 1804–1865 ) and john bright ( 1811–1889 ) belonged , were staunch defenders of free trade the breakdown of laissez-faire as practised by the british empire was partly led by british companies eager for state support of their positions abroad , in particular british oil companies frank bourgin 's study of the constitutional convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the founding fathers the goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of europe others , including jefferson , view bourgin 's study , written in the 1940s and not published until 1989 , as an over-interpretation of the evidence , intended originally to defend the new deal and later to counter ronald reagan 's economic policies donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the united states had distinctive characteristics and that '' at the center of classical liberal theory in europe was the idea of laissez-faire in order to help pay for its war effort in the civil war , the united states government imposed its first personal income tax on 5 august 1861 as part of the revenue act of 1861 ( 3 % of all incomes over us 800 ; rescinded in 1872 ) the progressive era saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the woodrow wilson administration 's new freedom program for example , in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by '' voluntary '' export restrictions from japan put simply , the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic '' this viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation , which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare rand 's political philosophy emphasized individual rights ( including property rights ) and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights benjamin tucker is one eminent american individualist anarchist who adopted a laissez-faire system he termed anarchistic socialism in contraposition to state socialism '' critics of laissez-faire as commonly understood argues that a truly laissez-faire system would be anti-capitalist and socialist kevin carson describes his politics as on '' the outer fringes of both free market libertarianism and socialism '' '' introductions – kevin carson '' carson believes that tucker overlooked this issue due to tucker 's focus on individual market transactions whereas he also focuses on organizational issues the british economist john maynard keynes condemned laissez-faire economic policy on several occasions

gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc project started as the advanced seismic computer '' seismic '' was replaced by '' scientific '' in the name , allowing the project to retain the designation asc the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed 16 of the registers were used for addressing , 16 for scalar operations , 8 for index offsets , and 8 for specifying the various parameters for vector instructions the crs stored the state required for communication between the various parts of the asc : the cpu , vps , and channel controllers although the asc was in some ways a more expandable design , in the supercomputer market speed is preferred , and the cray-1 was much faster asc 2 was leased to shell oil company in the netherlands and also used for seismic data processing the ti asc : a highly modular and flexible super computer architecture ti asc documentation at bitsavers.org

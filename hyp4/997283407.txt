gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc project started as the advanced seismic computer the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed the vector lanes were also used for scalar instructions , and each lane could keep up to 12 scalar instructions in-flight simultaneously most vector processors tended to be memory bandwidth-limited , that is , they could process data faster than they could get it from memory the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) the asc 1 prototype was a one pipe system and brought up in austin , texas , off site from ti 's main plant for proprietary information reasons asc systems 5 and 6 were installed at ti 's main plant in austin and also used by gsi for seismic data processing the ti asc : a highly modular and flexible super computer architecture ti asc documentation at bitsavers.org

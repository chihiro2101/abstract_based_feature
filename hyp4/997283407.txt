gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc project started as the advanced seismic computer '' seismic '' was replaced by '' scientific '' in the name , allowing the project to retain the designation asc the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the mcu was a two-way , 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors , with a ninth channel for accessing '' main memory '' ( referred to as '' extended memory '' ) the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed the vector lanes were also used for scalar instructions , and each lane could keep up to 12 scalar instructions in-flight simultaneously 16 of the registers were used for addressing , 16 for scalar operations , 8 for index offsets , and 8 for specifying the various parameters for vector instructions the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) asc systems 5 and 6 were installed at ti 's main plant in austin and also used by gsi for seismic data processing

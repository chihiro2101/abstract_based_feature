gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc project started as the advanced seismic computer the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the mcu was a two-way , 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors , with a ninth channel for accessing '' main memory '' ( referred to as '' extended memory '' ) the cpu had an extremely advanced architecture and organization for its era , supporting microcoded arithmetic and mathematical instructions that operated on scalars , vectors , or matrices the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed most vector processors tended to be memory bandwidth-limited , that is , they could process data faster than they could get it from memory in the asc this was improved somewhat with a lookahead unit that predicted upcoming memory accesses and loaded them into the scalar registers invisibly , using a memory interface in the cpu called the memory buffer unit ( mbu ) asc systems 5 and 6 were installed at ti 's main plant in austin and also used by gsi for seismic data processing the ti asc : a highly modular and flexible super computer architecture ti asc documentation at bitsavers.org

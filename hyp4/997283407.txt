ti began as a division of geophysical service incorporated ( gsi ) , a company that performed seismic surveys for oil exploration companies gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc was based around a single high-speed shared memory , which was accessed by the cpu and eight i/o channel controllers , in an organization similar to seymour cray 's groundbreaking cdc 6600 the mcu was a two-way , 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors , with a ninth channel for accessing '' main memory '' ( referred to as '' extended memory '' ) the mcu also acted as a cache controller , offering high-speed access to a semiconductor-based memory for the eight processor ports , and handling all communications to the 24-bit address space in main memory for instance , main memory could be constructed out of slower but less expensive core memory , although this was not used in practice the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed data was moved between the registers and memory by load/store instructions , which could transfer from 4â€“64 & nbsp ; bits ( two registers ) at a time most vector processors tended to be memory bandwidth-limited , that is , they could process data faster than they could get it from memory the cray-1 dedicated almost all of its design to sustained high-speed access to memory , including over one million 64-bit words of semiconductor memory and a cycle time that was one-fifth that of the asc ( 12.5 & nbsp ; ns ) asc systems 5 and 6 were installed at ti 's main plant in austin and also used by gsi for seismic data processing

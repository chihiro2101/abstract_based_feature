gsi was now a subsidiary of ti , and ti wanted to apply the latest computer technology to the processing and analysis of seismic datasets the asc project started as the advanced seismic computer the mcu also acted as a cache controller , offering high-speed access to a semiconductor-based memory for the eight processor ports , and handling all communications to the 24-bit address space in main memory for instance , main memory could be constructed out of slower but less expensive core memory , although this was not used in practice the vector processing facilities had a memory-to-memory architecture ; where the vector operands were read from , and the resulting vector written to , memory the cpu could be have one , two , or four vector lanes , allowing the cpu to produce one to four vector results every cycle , depending on the number of vector lanes installed each vp had its own program counter and registers , and the system could thus run eight programs at the same time , limited only by memory accesses when asc machines first became available in the early 1970s , they outperformed almost all other machines , including the cdc star-100 , and under certain conditions matched that of the one-off illiac iv asc 2 was leased to shell oil company in the netherlands and also used for seismic data processing asc systems 5 and 6 were installed at ti 's main plant in austin and also used by gsi for seismic data processing the ti asc : a highly modular and flexible super computer architecture ti asc documentation at bitsavers.org

settlement of kent by continental peoples , primarily jutes , was complete by the end of the sixth century eadbald 's father , æthelberht , probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590 , though the chronology of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately kirby , earliest english kings , pp 31–33 , provides an extended discussion of the chronology of æthelberht 's reign æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler bede as having overlordship , or imperium , over other anglo-saxon kingdoms this dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute , and kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of æthelberht 's death in 616 , with trade well-established with the europe in 597 augustine was sent by pope gregory i to england to convert them to christianity augustine landed in eastern kent , and soon managed to convert æthelberht , who gave augustine land in canterbury two other rulers , sæberht , king of essex , and rædwald , king of east anglia , were converted through æthelberht 's influence an important source for this period in kentish history is the ecclesiastical history of the english people , written in 731 by bede , a benedictine monk from northumbria a series of related texts known as the legend of st mildrith provides additional information about events in the lives of eadbald 's children and throws some light on eadbald himself other sources include papal letters , regnal lists of the kings of kent , and early charters left the ancestry of æthelberht , eadbald 's father , is given by bede , who states that he was descended from the legendary founder of kent , hengist however , historians believe that hengist and his brother horsa were probably mythical figures kelly , æthelberht i , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 eadbald had a sister , æthelburg , who was probably also the child of bertha archbishop laurence of canterbury persuaded eadbald to accept christianity and give up his wife the papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of æthelwald , a brother of eadbald 's , refers to æthelwald as a king ; if he existed , he would presumably have been a junior king to eadbald the two kingdoms within kent were east and west kent although æthelberht had been christian since about 600 and his wife bertha was also christian , eadbald was a pagan the name of æthelberht 's second wife is not recorded , but it seems likely that she was a pagan , since on his death she married eadbald , her stepson : a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church bede records that eadbald 's repudiation of christianity was a '' severe setback '' to the growth of the church sæberht , the king of essex , had become a christian under æthelberht 's influence , but on sæberht 's death , at about the same time , his sons expelled mellitus , the bishop of london eadbald 's second wife , ymme , was a frank , and it is possible that kent 's strong connections with francia were a factor in the king 's conversion these objects probably date from the period of the pagan reaction bede 's account of eadbald 's rejection of the church and subsequent conversion is quite detailed but not without some internal inconsistency 616 : eadbald leads a pagan reaction to christianity at about this time mellitus , bishop of london , is expelled by the sons of sæberht in essex and goes to kent 616 : mellitus and justus , bishop of rochester , leave kent for francia by 625 edwin of deira , king of northumbria , asks for the hand in marriage of æthelburg , eadbald 's sister 21 july 625 : justus consecrates paulinus bishop of york easter 626 : æthelburg gives birth to a daughter , eanflæd the letter to æthelburg mentions that the pope has recently heard the news of eadbald 's conversion and encourages her to work for the conversion of her husband , edwin kirby points out that boniface 's letter to æthelburg makes it clear that the news of eadbald 's conversion is recent , and that it is unthinkable that boniface would not have been kept up to date on the status of eadbald 's conversion later 624 : the pope receives news of eadbald 's conversion and writes to æthelburg and edwin thumb eadbald 's influence over other anglo-saxon kingdoms was less than æthelberht 's eadbald and ymme had a daughter , eanswith ( who founded the very first nunnery on english soil at folkestone , 15 miles from canterbury ) , and two sons , eorcenberht and eormenred however , an early text ( caligula a.xiv ) refers to eormenred as 'king ' , suggesting either he was a junior king under eorcenberht , or had a shared kingship

settlement of kent by continental peoples , primarily jutes , was complete by the end of the sixth century eadbald 's father , æthelberht , probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590 , though the chronology of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately kirby , earliest english kings , pp 31–33 , provides an extended discussion of the chronology of æthelberht 's reign æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler bede as having overlordship , or imperium , over other anglo-saxon kingdoms this dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute , and kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of æthelberht 's death in 616 , with trade well-established with the europe two other rulers , sæberht , king of essex , and rædwald , king of east anglia , were converted through æthelberht 's influence an important source for this period in kentish history is the ecclesiastical history of the english people , written in 731 by bede , a benedictine monk from northumbria bede was primarily interested in the christianization of england , but he also provides substantial information about secular history , including the reigns of æthelberht and eadbald a series of related texts known as the legend of st mildrith provides additional information about events in the lives of eadbald 's children and throws some light on eadbald himself other sources include papal letters , regnal lists of the kings of kent , and early charters none survive in original form from eadbald 's reign , but some later copies exist left the ancestry of æthelberht , eadbald 's father , is given by bede , who states that he was descended from the legendary founder of kent , hengist kelly , æthelberht i , oxford online dictionary of national biography , 2004 eadbald had a sister , æthelburg , who was probably also the child of bertha æthelburg married edwin , king of northumbria , one of the dominant anglo-saxon kings of the seventh century it is possible that there was another brother , named æthelwald : the evidence for this is a papal letter to justus , archbishop of canterbury from 619 to 625 , in which a king named aduluald is referred to , and who is apparently different from audubald , which refers to eadbald the two kingdoms within kent were east and west kent although æthelberht had been christian since about 600 and his wife bertha was also christian , eadbald was a pagan the name of æthelberht 's second wife is not recorded , but it seems likely that she was a pagan , since on his death she married eadbald , her stepson : a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church bede records that eadbald 's repudiation of christianity was a '' severe setback '' to the growth of the church according to bede , eadbald was punished for his faithlessness by '' frequent fits of insanity '' , and possession by an '' evil spirit '' ( perhaps referring to epileptic fits ) , yorke , kings and kingdoms , p in the 620s , eadbald 's sister æthelburg came to kent , but sent her children to the court of king dagobert i in francia ; in addition to the diplomatic connections , trade with the franks was important to kent a cemetery in east kent '' and '' the archaeology of conversion : cemeteries '' , both in campbell , the anglo-saxons , pp bede 's account of eadbald 's rejection of the church and subsequent conversion is quite detailed but not without some internal inconsistency bede 's version of events is laid out as follows : 24 february 616 : æthelberht dies and eadbald succeeds 616 : mellitus and justus , bishop of rochester , leave kent for francia 616/617 : some time after mellitus and justus depart , laurence , the archbishop of canterbury , plans to leave for francia but has a vision in which st peter scourges him in the morning he shows the scars to eadbald who is converted to christianity as a result 617 : justus and mellitus both return from francia '' the year after they left '' 619–624 : eadbald builds a church which is consecrated by archbishop mellitus 624 : after justus 's succession , pope boniface writes to him to say that he has heard in letters from king aduluald ( possibly a scribal error for eadbald ) of the king 's conversion to christianity by 625 edwin of deira , king of northumbria , asks for the hand in marriage of æthelburg , eadbald 's sister in that case it would appear that laurence converted eadbald , and justus converted æthelwald paulinus eventually returned to kent , where at eadbald 's and archbishop honorius 's request he became bishop of rochester , and york was not made an archbishopric for another century eadbald 's granddaughter eafe married merewalh , king of the magonsæte coins were probably first minted in kent in æthelberht 's reign , though none bear his name however , an early text ( caligula a.xiv ) refers to eormenred as 'king ' , suggesting either he was a junior king under eorcenberht , or had a shared kingship

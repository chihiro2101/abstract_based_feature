there are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or graduate entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor 's degree there has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between british , us , and australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes the australian grades are divided into four categories : high distinction , distinction , credit , and pass ( though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems ) assessment and evaluation based on the australian system is not equivalent to british or us schemes because of the '' low-marking '' scheme used by australian universities for example , a british student who achieves 70+ will receive an a grade , whereas an australian student with 70+ will receive a distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme the australian government usually offer full funding ( fees and a monthly stipend ) to its citizens and permanent residents who are pursuing research-based higher degrees requirements for the successful completion of a taught master 's programme are that the student pass all the required modules the academic year for an australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters ( eight months of study ) requirements for research-based programmes vary among universities students for fear that they may not be sufficiently prepared to undertake independent research in such cases , an alternative degree will be awarded for their previous work , usually an m.phil generally , in order to be accepted , the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas , as a complement to usual coursework graduate certificates ( sometimes called '' postgraduate certificates '' ) master 's degree ( course-based and thesis-based ) doctoral degree admission to a graduate certificate program requires a university degree ( or in some cases , a diploma with years of related experience ) admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal at english-speaking universities , applicants from countries where english is not the primary language are required to submit scores from the test of english as a foreign language ( toefl ) in exceptional cases , a student holding an honours bachelor or canadian bachelor with honours with sufficiently high grades and proven writing and research abilities may be admitted directly to a ph.d program after satisfactory performance in the first year , bypassing the master 's degree high-performing students may be admitted to the '' ph.d.2 '' ( 2nd ph.d in the case of ph.d.s , the research direction is usually known as it will typically follow the direction of the master 's research master 's degrees can possibly be completed in one year but normally take at least two , or in the case of a required research-based thesis a maximum of three ; they typically do not exceed five years graduate students may take out student loans , but instead they often work as teaching or research assistants students comes from a variety of sources , and many universities waive tuition fees for doctoral candidates graduate certificates require between eight and sixteen months of study however , some may require a research project or a work placement both master 's and doctoral programs may be done by coursework or research or a combination of the two , depending on the subject and faculty master 's candidates undertaking research are typically required to complete a thesis comprising some original research and ranging from seventy to two-hundred pages the royal military college of canada is a bilingual university , and allows a thesis to be in either english or french , but requires the abstract to be in both official languages there are 87 public universities in france , and also some private universities , and they are based upon the european education ladder including bachelors , masters , and ph.d.s admission to a postgraduate degree programme in nigeria requires a bachelor 's degree with at least a second class lower division ( not less than 2.75/5 ) the doctoral degree is for a minimum of 36 months and may involve coursework alongside the presentation of seminars and a research thesis ( at least lower second , but usually an upper second or first class ) masters students may also have the option of a postgraduate loan introduced by the uk government in 2016 some schools have an intermediate category , passing at the master 's level , which allows the student to leave with a master 's without having completed a master 's thesis at many elite universities , these stipends have been increasing , in response both to student pressure and , especially , to competition among the elite universities for graduate students funding differs greatly by departments and universities ; some universities give five years of full funding to all ph.d

there are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or graduate entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor 's degree there has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between british , us , and australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes the australian grades are divided into four categories : high distinction , distinction , credit , and pass ( though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems ) assessment and evaluation based on the australian system is not equivalent to british or us schemes because of the '' low-marking '' scheme used by australian universities for example , a british student who achieves 70+ will receive an a grade , whereas an australian student with 70+ will receive a distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme the australian government usually offer full funding ( fees and a monthly stipend ) to its citizens and permanent residents who are pursuing research-based higher degrees there are also highly competitive scholarships for international candidates who intend to pursue research-based programmes the academic year for an australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters ( eight months of study ) in brazil , a bachelor 's , licenciate or technologist degree is required in order to enter a graduate program , called pós-graduação generally , in order to be accepted , the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas , as a complement to usual coursework graduate certificates ( sometimes called '' postgraduate certificates '' ) master 's degree ( course-based and thesis-based ) doctoral degree admission to a graduate certificate program requires a university degree ( or in some cases , a diploma with years of related experience ) some colleges may provide english language upgrading to students prior to the start of their graduate certificate program admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal requirements are often set higher than those for a master 's program program without the requirement to first complete a master 's many canadian graduate programs allow students who start in a master 's to '' reclassify '' into a ph.d program after satisfactory performance in the first year , bypassing the master 's degree in the case of ph.d.s , the research direction is usually known as it will typically follow the direction of the master 's research master 's degrees can possibly be completed in one year but normally take at least two , or in the case of a required research-based thesis a maximum of three ; they typically do not exceed five years doctoral degrees require a minimum of three years but frequently take much longer , not usually exceeding six years graduate students may take out student loans , but instead they often work as teaching or research assistants graduate certificates require between eight and sixteen months of study master 's candidates undertaking research are typically required to complete a thesis comprising some original research and ranging from seventy to two-hundred pages one exception to this rule is mcgill university , where all work can be submitted in either english or french , unless the purpose of the course of study is acquisition of a language some grandes écoles deliver the french diplôme d'ingénieur , which is ranked as a master 's degree admission to a postgraduate degree programme in nigeria requires a bachelor 's degree with at least a second class lower division ( not less than 2.75/5 ) the master 's degree typically take 18–36 months with students undertaking coursework and presenting seminars and a dissertation the doctoral degree is for a minimum of 36 months and may involve coursework alongside the presentation of seminars and a research thesis ( at least lower second , but usually an upper second or first class ) in some institutions , doctoral candidates are initially admitted to a masters in research philosophy ( m.phil funding for postgraduate study in the uk is awarded competitively , and usually is disseminated by institution ( in the form of a certain allocation of studentships for a given year ) rather than directly to individuals doctoral students generally spend roughly their first two to three years doing coursework , and begin research by their second year if not before many master 's and all specialist students will perform research culminating in a paper , presentation , and defense of their research research positions are more typical of science disciplines ; they are relatively uncommon in humanities disciplines , and where they exist , they rarely allow the student to work on their own research funding differs greatly by departments and universities ; some universities give five years of full funding to all ph.d

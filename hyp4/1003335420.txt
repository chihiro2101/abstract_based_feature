there are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or graduate entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor 's degree the australian grades are divided into four categories : high distinction , distinction , credit , and pass ( though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems ) requirements for the successful completion of a taught master 's programme are that the student pass all the required modules some universities require eight taught modules for a one-year programme , twelve modules for a one-and-a-half-year programme , and twelve taught modules plus a thesis or dissertation for a two-year programme the academic year for an australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters ( eight months of study ) generally , however , a student is not required to take taught modules as part of their candidacy generally , in order to be accepted , the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas , as a complement to usual coursework funding , similar to wages , is available but is usually granted by public agencies linked to the university in question ( i.e some colleges may provide english language upgrading to students prior to the start of their graduate certificate program admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal admission to a doctoral program generally requires a thesis-type master 's degree in a related field , sufficiently high grades , recommendations , samples of writing , a research proposal , and typically an interview with a prospective supervisor requirements are often set higher than those for a master 's program in the case of ph.d.s , the research direction is usually known as it will typically follow the direction of the master 's research master 's degrees can possibly be completed in one year but normally take at least two , or in the case of a required research-based thesis a maximum of three ; they typically do not exceed five years doctoral degrees require a minimum of three years but frequently take much longer , not usually exceeding six years funding is available to first-year masters students whose transcripts reflect exceptionally high grades ; this funding is normally given in the second year however , some may require a research project or a work placement both master 's and doctoral programs may be done by coursework or research or a combination of the two , depending on the subject and faculty master 's candidates undertaking research are typically required to complete a thesis comprising some original research and ranging from seventy to two-hundred pages theses may be presented in english or in the language of the subject ( german for german literature , for example ) , but if this is the case an extensive abstract must be also presented in english the royal military college of canada is a bilingual university , and allows a thesis to be in either english or french , but requires the abstract to be in both official languages prior to 2004 , when the european system of lmd bologna process was founded , the french equivalent of a post graduate degree was called a '' maitrise '' for historical reasons dating back to the french revolution of 1789 , france has a dual education system , with grandes écoles on one side , and universities on the other hand , with the grandes écoles being considered as much more prestigious physician , surgeon , pharmacist , dentist , veterinarian diplomas ) as equivalent to a master 's degree in any other discipline , to account for the difficulty gap between getting a medical degree and getting non health related doctoral degrees , the latter requiring original research germany and the netherlands introduced the bologna process with a separation between bachelor and master programmes in many fields , except for education studies , law and other specially regulated subjects admission to a postgraduate degree programme in nigeria requires a bachelor 's degree with at least a second class lower division ( not less than 2.75/5 ) admission to doctoral programmes requires an academic master 's degree with a minimum weighted average of 60 % ( b average or 4.00/5 ) unn nigeria general entry qualifications for postgraduate programmes postgraduate degrees in nigeria include m.a admission to undertake a research degree in the uk typically requires a strong bachelor 's degree or scottish m.a funding for postgraduate study in the uk is awarded competitively , and usually is disseminated by institution ( in the form of a certain allocation of studentships for a given year ) rather than directly to individuals there are a number of scholarships for master 's courses , but these are relatively rare and dependent on the course and class of undergraduate degree obtained ( usually requiring at least a lower second ) the most widely available , and thus important , award for overseas students is the overseas research student ( ors ) award , which pays the difference in university fees between an overseas student and a british or eu resident in some departments , a comprehensive examination is often required in the first year of doctoral study , and is designed to test a student 's background undergraduate-level knowledge degree is a second professional degree , which includes two years of study and one to two years of research and a project in the candidates local area of work in some fields , research positions are more coveted than teaching positions because student researchers are typically paid to work on the dissertation they are required to complete anyway , while teaching is generally considered a distraction from one 's work moreover , some funding sources ( such as many nsf fellowships ) may only be awarded to domestic students

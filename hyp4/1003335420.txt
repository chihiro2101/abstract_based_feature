there are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or graduate entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor 's degree there has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between british , us , and australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes the australian grades are divided into four categories : high distinction , distinction , credit , and pass ( though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems ) assessment and evaluation based on the australian system is not equivalent to british or us schemes because of the '' low-marking '' scheme used by australian universities for example , a british student who achieves 70+ will receive an a grade , whereas an australian student with 70+ will receive a distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme there are also highly competitive scholarships for international candidates who intend to pursue research-based programmes requirements for the successful completion of a taught master 's programme are that the student pass all the required modules the academic year for an australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters ( eight months of study ) requirements for research-based programmes vary among universities in such cases , an alternative degree will be awarded for their previous work , usually an m.phil in brazil , a bachelor 's , licenciate or technologist degree is required in order to enter a graduate program , called pós-graduação admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal nevertheless , some french speaking universities , like hec montreal , also require candidates to submit toefl score or to pass their own english test requirements are often set higher than those for a master 's program in exceptional cases , a student holding an honours bachelor or canadian bachelor with honours with sufficiently high grades and proven writing and research abilities may be admitted directly to a ph.d high-performing students may be admitted to the '' ph.d.2 '' ( 2nd ph.d master 's degrees can possibly be completed in one year but normally take at least two , or in the case of a required research-based thesis a maximum of three ; they typically do not exceed five years doctoral degrees require a minimum of three years but frequently take much longer , not usually exceeding six years students often agree , as a condition of acceptance to a programme , not to devote more than twelve hours per week to work or outside interests students comes from a variety of sources , and many universities waive tuition fees for doctoral candidates most faculties require both , with the emphasis on research , and with coursework being directly related to the field of research master 's candidates undertaking research are typically required to complete a thesis comprising some original research and ranging from seventy to two-hundred pages candidates undertaking research must typically complete a thesis , or dissertation , consisting of original research representing a significant contribution to their field , and ranging from two-hundred to five-hundred pages theses may be presented in english or in the language of the subject ( german for german literature , for example ) , but if this is the case an extensive abstract must be also presented in english one exception to this rule is mcgill university , where all work can be submitted in either english or french , unless the purpose of the course of study is acquisition of a language hec montreal ) will accept students with little knowledge of french if they can communicate with their supervisors ( usually in english ) prior to 2004 , when the european system of lmd bologna process was founded , the french equivalent of a post graduate degree was called a '' maitrise '' for historical reasons dating back to the french revolution of 1789 , france has a dual education system , with grandes écoles on one side , and universities on the other hand , with the grandes écoles being considered as much more prestigious the master 's degree typically take 18–36 months with students undertaking coursework and presenting seminars and a dissertation such funding generally comes from research councils such as the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) , arts and humanities research council ( ahrc ) , medical research council ( mrc ) and others in some departments , a comprehensive examination is often required in the first year of doctoral study , and is designed to test a student 's background undergraduate-level knowledge many master 's and all specialist students will perform research culminating in a paper , presentation , and defense of their research in the second and third years of study , doctoral programs often require students to pass more examinations the increase in length of degree is a matter of great concern for both students and universities , though there is much disagreement on potential solutions to this problem at many elite universities , these stipends have been increasing , in response both to student pressure and , especially , to competition among the elite universities for graduate students funding differs greatly by departments and universities ; some universities give five years of full funding to all ph.d

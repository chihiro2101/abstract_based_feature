there are many professional programs such as medical and dental school require a previous bachelors for admission and are considered graduate or graduate entry programs even though they culminate in a bachelor 's degree there has also been some confusion over the conversion of the different marking schemes between british , us , and australian systems for the purpose of assessment for entry to graduate programmes the australian grades are divided into four categories : high distinction , distinction , credit , and pass ( though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems ) assessment and evaluation based on the australian system is not equivalent to british or us schemes because of the '' low-marking '' scheme used by australian universities for example , a british student who achieves 70+ will receive an a grade , whereas an australian student with 70+ will receive a distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme the australian government usually offer full funding ( fees and a monthly stipend ) to its citizens and permanent residents who are pursuing research-based higher degrees some universities require eight taught modules for a one-year programme , twelve modules for a one-and-a-half-year programme , and twelve taught modules plus a thesis or dissertation for a two-year programme the academic year for an australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters ( eight months of study ) students for fear that they may not be sufficiently prepared to undertake independent research in such cases , an alternative degree will be awarded for their previous work , usually an m.phil generally , in order to be accepted , the candidate must have above average grades and it is highly recommended to be initiated on scientific research through government programs on undergraduate areas , as a complement to usual coursework public universities do not charge fees for undergraduate level/course graduate certificates ( sometimes called '' postgraduate certificates '' ) master 's degree ( course-based and thesis-based ) doctoral degree admission to a graduate certificate program requires a university degree ( or in some cases , a diploma with years of related experience ) english speaking colleges require proof of english language proficiency such as ielts some colleges may provide english language upgrading to students prior to the start of their graduate certificate program admission to a high-quality thesis-type master 's program generally requires an honours degree or canadian honours degree , samples of the student 's writing as well as a research thesis proposal at english-speaking universities , applicants from countries where english is not the primary language are required to submit scores from the test of english as a foreign language ( toefl ) program after satisfactory performance in the first year , bypassing the master 's degree in the case of ph.d.s , the research direction is usually known as it will typically follow the direction of the master 's research doctoral degrees require a minimum of three years but frequently take much longer , not usually exceeding six years graduate students may take out student loans , but instead they often work as teaching or research assistants funding is available to first-year masters students whose transcripts reflect exceptionally high grades ; this funding is normally given in the second year students comes from a variety of sources , and many universities waive tuition fees for doctoral candidates however , some may require a research project or a work placement both master 's and doctoral programs may be done by coursework or research or a combination of the two , depending on the subject and faculty candidates undertaking research must typically complete a thesis , or dissertation , consisting of original research representing a significant contribution to their field , and ranging from two-hundred to five-hundred pages at english-speaking canadian universities , both master 's and ph.d germany and the netherlands introduced the bologna process with a separation between bachelor and master programmes in many fields , except for education studies , law and other specially regulated subjects admission to doctoral programmes requires an academic master 's degree with a minimum weighted average of 60 % ( b average or 4.00/5 ) the doctoral degree is for a minimum of 36 months and may involve coursework alongside the presentation of seminars and a research thesis admission to undertake a research degree in the uk typically requires a strong bachelor 's degree or scottish m.a such funding generally comes from research councils such as the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) , arts and humanities research council ( ahrc ) , medical research council ( mrc ) and others however , many us master 's degree programs do not require a master 's thesis , focusing instead primarily on course work or on '' practicals '' or '' workshops in the second and third years of study , doctoral programs often require students to pass more examinations funding differs greatly by departments and universities ; some universities give five years of full funding to all ph.d

when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort when montcalm returned to fort frontenac , he found a force of 3500 men assembled , being regular french troops , canadian militia , and native americans montcalm 's first victory in north america came relatively quickly and easily , and signified to the british that the french now had a capable general heading their army vaudreuil drew up plans for montcalm that ordered him to march south and take the british bases south of lake champlain , fort william henry and fort edward a few miles further south from fort carillon , montcalm and a force of 6200 regulars and militia , along with 1800 natives set upon fort william henry on 3 august 1757 under the terms of the surrender , the garrison was to be escorted back to fort edward , where they would be barred from serving against the french for 18 months , and all british prisoners were to be returned to the french , who also kept all the stores and ammunition on july 5 , the british began to set upon the fort , but the killing of the british second-in-command held them up long enough for canadian reinforcements to arrive and bring montcalm 's total force to over 3600 the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters the french minister of war nonetheless expressed his full support to montcalm , confident that despite the odds , he would find a way to frustrate the enemy 's plans , as he had done at fort carillon this news , along with the threat of impending attack by the british , crushed montcalm 's spirit , who had lost all hope of holding the city in case of a siege montcalm 's service in new france was marked by conflict between himself and the governor general of the colony , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france '' montcalm quoted in the conflict between montcalm and vaudreuil would be largely solved or at least rendered irrelevant when , in 1758 , the former was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general , thus outranking the latter , and acquiring a virtually free hand in the determination of military strategy montcalm close orewa auckland new zealand montcalm avenue , baie-comeau , qc montcalm street , lake george village , ny montcalm road , charlton , london

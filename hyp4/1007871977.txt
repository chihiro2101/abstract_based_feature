when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp upon montcalm 's arrival in montreal , he was immediately apprised of the situation along the border with british north america concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort when montcalm returned to fort frontenac , he found a force of 3500 men assembled , being regular french troops , canadian militia , and native americans in july 1758 , vaudreuil sent montcalm to block a british push near fort carillon , on lake champlain on july 5 , the british began to set upon the fort , but the killing of the british second-in-command held them up long enough for canadian reinforcements to arrive and bring montcalm 's total force to over 3600 despite the relative insecurity of this particular fort and the overwhelming number of enemy troops , the french were able to hold the garrison due a series of costly errors by the british general abercrombie the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters montcalm also accused vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops , and montcalm specifically , into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces , a claim quickly refuted by vaudreuil , who subsequently requested that montcalm be recalled to france and that the chevalier de lévis be appointed to succeed him the french minister of war nonetheless expressed his full support to montcalm , confident that despite the odds , he would find a way to frustrate the enemy 's plans , as he had done at fort carillon montcalm , on many occasions , managed to repel attempted landings by the british forces , most notably at the battle of beauport , on 31 july 1759 before montcalm could react , wolfe 's forces had already reached the plains outside the city , and were ready for battle the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france ' '' montcalm quoted in waging the war that way would ensure the preservation and extension of french military honour , which was of particular importance to the king and his government after the loss of fort beauséjour at the outset of the war montcalm close orewa auckland new zealand montcalm avenue , baie-comeau , qc montcalm street , lake george village , ny montcalm road , charlton , london

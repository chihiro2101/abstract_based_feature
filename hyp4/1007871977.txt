when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort when montcalm returned to fort frontenac , he found a force of 3500 men assembled , being regular french troops , canadian militia , and native americans montcalm 's first victory in north america came relatively quickly and easily , and signified to the british that the french now had a capable general heading their army under the terms of the surrender , the garrison was to be escorted back to fort edward , where they would be barred from serving against the french for 18 months , and all british prisoners were to be returned to the french , who also kept all the stores and ammunition however , as the garrison left fort william henry , they were attacked by natives , and nearly 200 of the 2000 prisoners were either taken or killed , breaching the terms of surrender montcalm decided not to advance on to fort edward despite the demoralization of the british forces and the proximity of the fort , claiming the road was too bad for his heavy guns and that the garrison would be reinforced before they arrived on july 5 , the british began to set upon the fort , but the killing of the british second-in-command held them up long enough for canadian reinforcements to arrive and bring montcalm 's total force to over 3600 despite the relative insecurity of this particular fort and the overwhelming number of enemy troops , the french were able to hold the garrison due a series of costly errors by the british general abercrombie the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters montcalm also accused vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops , and montcalm specifically , into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces , a claim quickly refuted by vaudreuil , who subsequently requested that montcalm be recalled to france and that the chevalier de l√©vis be appointed to succeed him louis xv therefore ordered the colony to reduce its defensive perimeter to the valley of the saint lawrence river , evacuating all forts in ohio along with those around lake ontario and lake champlain in a decision largely considered to be montcalm 's greatest mistake , the general decided to attack the british with what forces he had rather than wait for the forces garrisoned along the shore to come and bolster his numbers the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france montcalm close orewa auckland new zealand montcalm avenue , baie-comeau , qc montcalm street , lake george village , ny montcalm road , charlton , london

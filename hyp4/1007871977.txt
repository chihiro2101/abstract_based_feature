when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort when montcalm returned to fort frontenac , he found a force of 3500 men assembled , being regular french troops , canadian militia , and native americans the following year , montcalm achieved his greatest military success to date with the taking of fort william henry vaudreuil drew up plans for montcalm that ordered him to march south and take the british bases south of lake champlain , fort william henry and fort edward a few miles further south montcalm decided not to advance on to fort edward despite the demoralization of the british forces and the proximity of the fort , claiming the road was too bad for his heavy guns and that the garrison would be reinforced before they arrived on july 5 , the british began to set upon the fort , but the killing of the british second-in-command held them up long enough for canadian reinforcements to arrive and bring montcalm 's total force to over 3600 montcalm also accused vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops , and montcalm specifically , into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces , a claim quickly refuted by vaudreuil , who subsequently requested that montcalm be recalled to france and that the chevalier de l√©vis be appointed to succeed him in the second half of 1758 , the british began to take the upper hand in north america , due on one part to the massive resources they organized against the french and on the other part to the lack of reinforcements and supplies from france to support its colony , which was already on the brink of starvation following a catastrophic harvest wolfe 's forces reached quebec in late june , 1759 , and taking position on the opposite shore , started bombarding the city on july 12 , reducing the city to rubble over the course of two months montcalm 's service in new france was marked by conflict between himself and the governor general of the colony , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial montcalm was a soldier in the army ( troupes de terres ) , while vaudreuil was a marine in the navy ( compagnies franches de la marine ) the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france montcalm was of the opinion that '' colonial methods had had their day , and now war was established 'on a european footing , with planned campaigns , armies , artillery , sieges , battles montcalm close orewa auckland new zealand montcalm avenue , baie-comeau , qc montcalm street , lake george village , ny montcalm road , charlton , london

when the seven years ' war spread to new france , king louis xv sent brigadier general montcalm to the colonies as commander-in-chief , with colonel chevalier de levis now as his second-in-command and capitaine louis antoine de bougainville as his new aide-de-camp concerned by the number of british troops amassing near the border , montcalm left to visit fort carillon to inspect the defenses while the governor general , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial , began to prepare troops at fort frontenac for a potential assault on oswego , a british fort across lake ontario montcalm 's assemblage of troops at fort carillon distracted the attention of the british , and upon receiving positive reports from scouts , vaudreuil and montcalm decided to make an approach and try to take the fort montcalm 's first victory in north america came relatively quickly and easily , and signified to the british that the french now had a capable general heading their army the following year , montcalm achieved his greatest military success to date with the taking of fort william henry vaudreuil drew up plans for montcalm that ordered him to march south and take the british bases south of lake champlain , fort william henry and fort edward a few miles further south from fort carillon , montcalm and a force of 6200 regulars and militia , along with 1800 natives set upon fort william henry on 3 august 1757 montcalm decided not to advance on to fort edward despite the demoralization of the british forces and the proximity of the fort , claiming the road was too bad for his heavy guns and that the garrison would be reinforced before they arrived the battle was a major success for the french and a major setback for the british , and greatly added to the reputation of montcalm , who boasted of his victory and often exaggerated his claims in writings back to france while disparaging the efforts of the canadian and native fighters montcalm also accused vaudreuil of purposely sending his troops , and montcalm specifically , into a slaughter based on the size of the respective forces , a claim quickly refuted by vaudreuil , who subsequently requested that montcalm be recalled to france and that the chevalier de l√©vis be appointed to succeed him this news , along with the threat of impending attack by the british , crushed montcalm 's spirit , who had lost all hope of holding the city in case of a siege montcalm 's service in new france was marked by conflict between himself and the governor general of the colony , pierre de rigaud , marquis de vaudreuil-cavagnial montcalm was a soldier in the army ( troupes de terres ) , while vaudreuil was a marine in the navy ( compagnies franches de la marine ) the culture of the french metropolitan officer led montcalm and others like him to see the seven years ' war in terms of a defence of their own and their kingdom 's honour , regardless of what it meant for new france conversely , the culture of the canadian colonial officer led vaudreuil and others like him to interpret the war in terms of a defence of the territorial integrity of new france and thus its very existence montcalm close orewa auckland new zealand montcalm avenue , baie-comeau , qc montcalm street , lake george village , ny montcalm road , charlton , london

thumb after germany had lost world war i ( 1914–1918 ) , the german revolution of 1918–1919 ended the monarchy the german empire was abolished and a democratic system , the weimar republic , was established in 1919 by the weimar national assembly in 1919–20 , the government of germany was formed by the weimar coalition , consisting of the social democratic party ( spd ) , german democratic party ( ddp , left-of-centre liberals ) , and zentrum ( conservative catholics ) president friedrich ebert , chancellor gustav bauer , and defence minister gustav noske were all members of the spd according to the constitution , the president was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces , represented in peace time by the minister of defence the most senior officer of the land forces was called chef der heeresleitung , a post held in early 1920 by general walther reinhardt the german government had repeatedly used freikorps troops to put down communist uprisings after the war under the terms of the treaty of versailles , which came into effect on 10 january 1920 , germany was required to reduce its land forces to a maximum of 100,000 men the initial deadline was set for 31 march 1920 ( later extended to the end of the year ) since the reason for their creation—internal repression—had become obsolete with the crushing of the leftist uprisings , they were becoming a threat to the government the latter numbered from 5,000–6,000 men and had been stationed at the truppenübungsplatz döberitz , near berlin , since january 1920 an elite force , it had been created from former imperial navy officers and ncos , boosted later by ( those who had fought the bolsheviks in latvia in 1919 ) it was extremely opposed to the democratic government of friedrich ebert noske then removed the marinebrigade from lüttwitz ' command and assigned it to the leadership of the navy , hoping that they would disband the unit lüttwitz ignored the order but agreed to a meeting with president ebert , suggested by his staff left in the evening of 10 march , lüttwitz came with his staff to ebert 's office lüttwitz went to döberitz on 11 march and asked ehrhardt whether he would be able to occupy berlin that evening ehrhardt said he needed another day but in the morning of 13 march he could be in the centre of berlin with his men one factor making them support quick action was that sympathetic members of the sicherheitspolizei in berlin informed them that warrants for their arrest had been issued that day to defend the government , noske ordered two regiments of sicherheitspolizei and one regular regiment to take position in the government quarter but doubted that a putsch was imminent the regimental commanders decided not to follow orders to shoot , a decision that received the approval of chef des truppenamts general hans von seeckt the brigade , sporting swastikas on their helmets and vehicles , started off towards berlin at around 10:00 & nbsp ; pm others have quoted seeckt 's words as the even more succinct : '' reichswehr does not fire on reichswehr ! '' noske , depressed enough by the disloyalty of the military to speak about suicide to an aide , reported to the cabinet at 4:00 & nbsp ; am these were not unanimous , the vice-chancellor eugen schiffer and some of the other non-spd ministers refused to leave the city , to preserve the opportunity to negotiate with the putschists only ebert and the spd ministers signed the call for a general strike within ten minutes of their departure , the marinebrigade reached the brandenburger tor , where it was met by lüttwitz , ludendorff , kapp and their followers supported by a battalion of regular reichswehr , they occupied the government quarter international con-man ignaz trebitsch-lincoln became kapp 's press censor thumb there was no military resistance to the putsch ; the regular troops in berlin , sicherheitspolizei , navy , the army commands of east-prussia , pomerania , brandenburg and silesia , formally accepted the new minister of defence and reichskanzler the putschists offered only the resignation of kapp , and lüttwitz tried to hold on for another day as head of a military dictatorship but his commanders deserted him the violence came from local military commanders who supported the new government and arrested pickets , which the workers resisted after the putsch noske named kapp , pabst and ehrhardt as being responsible , despite the support from much higher up in the army

there are many parallels between hornblower and real naval officers of the period , notably admiral lord nelson and also george cockburn , lord cochrane , sir edward pellew , jeremiah coghlan , sir james gordon , william hoste , and many others the actions of the royal navy at the time , documented in official reports , gave much material for hornblower 's fictional adventures national maritime museum : '' horatio hornblower '' the name '' horatio '' was inspired by the character in william shakespeare 's hamlet and chosen also because of its association with contemporary figures such as nelson forester 's original inspiration was an old copy of the naval chronicle , which described the effective dates of the treaty of ghent it was possible for two countries to still be at war in one part of the world after a peace was obtained months before in another because of the time required to communicate around the world at the same time , forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history , so hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval victory occurs during the napoleonic wars forester 's horatio hornblower to patrick o'brian 's jack aubrey and stephen maturin '' hornblower and the eponymous protagonist of marryat 's peter simple both start their career rather unpromisingly and without influential friends , but advance themselves through hard work , honesty and bravery hornblower is courageous , intelligent , and a skilled seaman , but he is also burdened by his intense reserve , introspection , and self-doubt , and is described as '' unhappy and lonely '' his sense of duty , hard work , and drive to succeed make these imagined negative characteristics undetectable by everyone but him and , being introspective , he obsesses over petty failures to reinforce his poor self-image he is guarded with nearly everyone , unless the matter is the business of discharging his duty as a king 's officer , in which case he is clear and decisive hornblower possesses a highly developed sense of duty , though on occasion he is able to set it aside ; for example , in hornblower and the hotspur , he contrives an escape for his personal steward , who would otherwise have to be hanged for striking a superior officer as a midshipman , he becomes seasick at the sheltered roadstead of spithead , an embarrassment which haunts him throughout his career in the happy return , the first novel published , hornblower 's age is given as 37 in july 1808 , implying a birth year of 1770 or 1771 northcote parkinson in his '' biography '' called the true story of horatio hornblower gives slight scholarly corrections to various aspects of hornblower 's life as narrated by his creator he joins the royal navy as a midshipman where he is horribly bullied and tries to resolve the matter with a duel he leads a daring rescue of spanish civilians from a shipwreck under extremely hazardous conditions , which leads to his being picked up by a british warship patrolling offshore ; but since he had given his spanish captors his parole that he would not escape , he insists upon being returned to captivity as a junior lieutenant , he serves in hms renown under captain sawyer , whose bouts of paranoia on a mission to the caribbean strain discipline to breaking point in 1803 , renewed hostilities against france seem imminent , and hornblower is confirmed in the rank of commander , and appointed captain of the sloop-of-war maria dotes upon the irritable hornblower in ways that he finds vexing ; she knows little of the sea , and annoys him both with her ignorance and hero-worship of him , which clashes with his eternally low self-image after gruelling service during the blockade of brest aboard hotspur , he is promised a momentous promotion to post captain by commander-in-chief william cornwallis and is recalled to england once there , he meets the secretary of the admiralty and the rank is conferred when hornblower agrees to take part in a dangerous clandestine operation that eventually leads to the resounding british victory at trafalgar his first task is to organise nelson 's funeral procession along the river thames and has to deal with the near-sinking of the barge conveying the hero 's coffin after this , atropos is ordered the join the british mediterranean fleet and hornblower is sent on a secret mission to recover gold and silver from a sunken british transport on the bottom of marmorice bay within the ottoman empire with the aid of pearl divers from ceylon after unloading the treasure at gibraltar , atropos and another british warship capture a large spanish frigate after a desperate battle in the friendly port of palermo , hornblower oversees the repair of atropos battle damage he captures natividad , a much more powerful spanish ship ( bush refers to it as a '' ship of the line '' , although hornblower believes this is stretching a point ) , but then has to cede it reluctantly to el supremo to placate him when he finds that the spanish have switched sides in the interim , he is forced to find and sink the ship he had captured—adding injury to insult , as he had given up a fortune in prize money to maintain the uneasy alliance with the madman hornblower also takes on an important passenger in panama—lady barbara wellesley , the fictional younger sister of arthur wellesley ( later to become the duke of wellington ) —also hornblower 's future wife and the love of his life he is at first nettled and infuriated by her forthright and outspoken manner , her ability to see easily through his reserve , and the great social gap between them hornblower is tormented by jealousy of leighton , compounded by the admiral 's dismissive treatment of him while waiting at his mediterranean rendezvous point for the rest of his squadron—and its commander—to arrive , he carries out a series of raids against the french along the south coast of spain , earning himself the nickname '' the terror of the mediterranean '' he leads a royalist guerrilla force , and causes the returned emperor 's forces much grief before his band is finally cornered ; in a desperate shootout , marie is slain , and a devastated hornblower captured according to parkinson , hornblower in later life became a director of p & o , governor of malta ( 1829–1831 ) , commander in chief at chatham ( 1832–1835 ) , a viscount ( in 1850 ) , and admiral of the fleet , dying at the age of 80 on 12 january 1857 this series covers the books , mr midshipman hornblower , lieutenant hornblower , hornblower and the hotspur and lord hornblower northcote parkinson which gives various scholarly '' corrections '' to the stories told by hornblower 's creator the astronauts of the 1972 apollo 17 mission to the moon named a small crater near the landing site horatio in honour of horatio hornblower .

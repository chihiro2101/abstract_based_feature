there are many parallels between hornblower and real naval officers of the period , notably admiral lord nelson and also george cockburn , lord cochrane , sir edward pellew , jeremiah coghlan , sir james gordon , william hoste , and many others the actions of the royal navy at the time , documented in official reports , gave much material for hornblower 's fictional adventures national maritime museum : '' horatio hornblower '' the name '' horatio '' was inspired by the character in william shakespeare 's hamlet and chosen also because of its association with contemporary figures such as nelson it was possible for two countries to still be at war in one part of the world after a peace was obtained months before in another because of the time required to communicate around the world at the same time , forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history , so hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval victory occurs during the napoleonic wars forester 's horatio hornblower to patrick o'brian 's jack aubrey and stephen maturin '' hornblower and the eponymous protagonist of marryat 's peter simple both start their career rather unpromisingly and without influential friends , but advance themselves through hard work , honesty and bravery both fight in duels before their careers have properly even started and both are taken prisoners early in their careers , but escape in extraordinary fashion his sense of duty , hard work , and drive to succeed make these imagined negative characteristics undetectable by everyone but him and , being introspective , he obsesses over petty failures to reinforce his poor self-image his introverted nature continually isolates him from the people around him , including his closest friend william bush , and his wives never fully understand him he is guarded with nearly everyone , unless the matter is the business of discharging his duty as a king 's officer , in which case he is clear and decisive hornblower possesses a highly developed sense of duty , though on occasion he is able to set it aside ; for example , in hornblower and the hotspur , he contrives an escape for his personal steward , who would otherwise have to be hanged for striking a superior officer as a midshipman , he becomes seasick at the sheltered roadstead of spithead , an embarrassment which haunts him throughout his career he is tone-deaf and finds music an incomprehensible irritant ( in a scene in hotspur , he is unable to recognise the british national anthem ) however , when forester decided to write about hornblower 's early career in the sixth novel mr midshipman hornblower , he made his hero about five years younger , giving his birth date as 4 july 1776 ( the date of the adoption of the united states declaration of independence ) northcote parkinson in his '' biography '' called the true story of horatio hornblower gives slight scholarly corrections to various aspects of hornblower 's life as narrated by his creator he is given a classics , and by the time he joins the royal navy at age seventeen , he is well-versed in greek and latin he fends off fire ships which interrupt his ( failing ) first examination for promotion to lieutenant as a junior lieutenant , he serves in hms renown under captain sawyer , whose bouts of paranoia on a mission to the caribbean strain discipline to breaking point due to his exploits , hornblower is made commander , but his promotion is not confirmed when he returns to england following the announcement of the peace of amiens , causing him great financial distress : he has to make up the difference between a commander 's pay and a lieutenant 's , all from his half-pay while inactive in 1803 , renewed hostilities against france seem imminent , and hornblower is confirmed in the rank of commander , and appointed captain of the sloop-of-war despite this unfortunate beginning , however , he warms to her over the course of several books , and becomes a good ( though not perfect ) husband to her and father to their two children , also named horatio and maria once there , he meets the secretary of the admiralty and the rank is conferred when hornblower agrees to take part in a dangerous clandestine operation that eventually leads to the resounding british victory at trafalgar following this exploit , hornblower is given command of the sixth-rate ship hms atropos after this , atropos is ordered the join the british mediterranean fleet and hornblower is sent on a secret mission to recover gold and silver from a sunken british transport on the bottom of marmorice bay within the ottoman empire with the aid of pearl divers from ceylon but just as this work is finished , the ship is given to the king of the two sicilies for diplomatic reasons , much to his disappointment later ( in the time line , but written of in the first novel ) , he makes a long , difficult voyage in command of the frigate hms lydia round the horn to the pacific , where his mission is to support a megalomaniac , el supremo , in his rebellion against the spanish hornblower also takes on an important passenger in panama—lady barbara wellesley , the fictional younger sister of arthur wellesley ( later to become the duke of wellington ) —also hornblower 's future wife and the love of his life he is at first nettled and infuriated by her forthright and outspoken manner , her ability to see easily through his reserve , and the great social gap between them over time , however , her beauty , strength , and intelligence win his heart , and the two become dangerously attracted to each other finally , while attempting to return to england , the hornblowers are caught in a hurricane , and horatio struggles desperately to save barbara 's life from the storm the first was in the first chapter of the happy return , which was the first hornblower novel written there are other discrepancies as well ; in one account of his defeat of a spanish frigate in the mediterranean , he distinguished himself as lieutenant and in another he is a post-captain with less than three years seniority in addition , the hornblower companion includes maps showing where the action took place in the ten complete novels plus forester 's notes on how they were written midshipman hornblower , lieutenant hornblower , and hornblower and the hotspur the popular richard sharpe novels by bernard cornwell were inspired by the hornblower series ; cornwell avidly read the series as a child , and was disappointed to learn that there was no similar series chronicling the napoleonic wars on land

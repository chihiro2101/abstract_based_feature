skat was developed by the members of the brommesche tarok-gesellschaft michael dummett , sylvia mann , the game of tarot : from ferrara to salt lake city , p 487 , united states games systems ( 1980 ) , between 1810 and 1817 in altenburg , in what is now the state of thuringia , germany it is based on the three-player game of tarock , also known as tarot , and the four-player game of schafkopf ( equivalent to the american game sheepshead ) 254 , oxford university press ( 1996 ) , it has become the most loved and widely played german card game , especially in german-speaking regions international skat order , international skat players assoc 15apr2007 in the earliest known form of the game , the player in the first seat was dealt twelve cards and the other two players ten each 7 , 8 , 162 , averill press ( 2008 ) , nevertheless , the rules continued to differ from one region to another until the first attempt to set them in order was made by a congress of skat players on 7 august 1886 in altenburg the current rules , followed by both the ispa and the german skat federation , date from jan encyclopædia britannica skat the word skat is a tarok term robert machenry , philip w 378 , ( 1897 ) the word scarto is still used in some other italian card games to this day , and is not to be confused with the american game called scat skat is a game for three players , who are known as forehand , middlehand and rearhand , rearhand also being the dealer ( see picture ) at the beginning of each round , or '' deal '' , one player becomes declarer and the other two players become the defending team the game can also be played by four players in this case , the dealer will sit out the round that was dealt , while the player to his right will play the role taken by the dealer in the three-player variant a central aspect of the game is the three coexisting varieties called '' suit '' , '' grand '' and '' null '' games , that differ in suit order , scoring and even overall goal to achieve each round of the game starts with a bidding phase to determine the declarer and the required minimum game value ( explained below ) then , ten tricks are played , allowing players to take trick points points from tricks are not directly added to the players ' overall score , they are used only to determine the outcome of the game ( win or loss for declarer ) , although winning by certain margins may increase the score for that round in tournaments a winning declarer gets an additional 50 points if they win , if the defending team wins however they receive 40 points each in addition to the declarer losing twice the game 's value in points often this does not become obvious before the player picks up the skat , or even not before the end of the game in question ( in case of a hand game , when the skat is not picked up ) the skat always belongs to the declarer , and if it contains certain high cards this may change the game value it is therefore not possible in general to determine the exact game value before knowing the skat the game value is determined by the type of the game and the game level as explained below for the suit , grand and null games each suit has a base value , as follows : : the highest-ranking cards for taking the tricks ( the jacks ) are not the highest scoring cards to win a null game , declarer must not take a single trick there are no card points in a null game even with the majority in card points , declarer may still lose if the game value is lower than the value he bid during the bidding an overbid hand is scored by determining the lowest possible game value that is a multiple of the base value of declarer 's suit ( or 24 in case of a grand ) which is at least as high as declarer 's bid their game value is now only 24 ( 12 × 2 ) — they have overbid unless they manage to play at least schneider ( raising the game value to 36 ) , or make a game other than clubs with a game value of at least 30 , the game will be lost suit ranks in ramsch are the same as in the grand game , with only the four jacks being trumps after all ten tricks are played , the player with the highest number of card points ( or alternatively , every player ) has their card points amount deducted from their score as negative game points ; tournée : to determine trump , declarer picks up one card of the skat and looks at it as in german skat , game points in north american skat are tallied by multiplying base game value by : 1 for each top trump , either with or without , plus : 1 for game ( 61 or more card points ) league games are organized worldwide : by the international skat players association in north america by ispa canada and ispa usa within germany by the german skat association

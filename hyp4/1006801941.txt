it is based on the three-player game of tarock , also known as tarot , and the four-player game of schafkopf ( equivalent to the american game sheepshead ) david parlett , oxford dictionary of card games , p 254 , oxford university press ( 1996 ) , it has become the most loved and widely played german card game , especially in german-speaking regions international skat order , international skat players assoc david parlett , teach yourself card games , p the current rules , followed by both the ispa and the german skat federation , date from jan encyclopædia britannica skat the word skat is a tarok term robert machenry , philip w : note : because of the many variations in the rules of skat , the rules below are necessarily general , although rules not found in official german tournament play are marked as such skat is a game for three players , who are known as forehand , middlehand and rearhand , rearhand also being the dealer ( see picture ) at the beginning of each round , or '' deal '' , one player becomes declarer and the other two players become the defending team the game can also be played by four players each round of the game starts with a bidding phase to determine the declarer and the required minimum game value ( explained below ) each card has a card value ( except in null games ) and is worth that number of points for the player winning the trick the declarer 's goal is to take at least 61 points in tricks in order to win that round of the game after each round a score is awarded in accordance with the game value dealing rotates clockwise around the table , so that the player sitting to the left of the dealer will be dealer for the next round how the actual game value is determined is explained in detail below and is necessary to understand in order to know how high one can safely bid often this does not become obvious before the player picks up the skat , or even not before the end of the game in question ( in case of a hand game , when the skat is not picked up ) players have therefore to exercise careful scrutiny during bidding , as not to incur an unnecessary loss the bidding may also give away some information about what cards a player may or may not hold the game value ( also called hand value , is what the game will be worth after all tricks have been played it is therefore not possible in general to determine the exact game value before knowing the skat the game value is determined by the type of the game and the game level as explained below for the suit , grand and null games in a suit game , one of the four suits is the trump suit there are no card points in a null game even with the majority in card points , declarer may still lose if the game value is lower than the value he bid during the bidding this value is then doubled and subtracted from declarer 's score ( negative score ) example : declarer bids 30 , missing the two top trumps ( without 2 ) , intending to play a club suit game ( game value would be 12 × 3 36 ) their game value is now only 24 ( 12 × 2 ) — they have overbid how high the player bid during the bidding is immaterial , as long as the game value is at least as high as declarer 's bid ( see overbid hands above ) unlike the original negative game the winner is who achieves the lowest score and is awarded 23 points , the score of a won null ; tournée : to determine trump , declarer picks up one card of the skat and looks at it if declarer wants this card 's suit as trump , the card is shown to the other players grand guckser is the only game in north american skat where declarer picks up both skat cards at once card points are the same as in german skat : a 11 , 10 10 , k 4 , q 3

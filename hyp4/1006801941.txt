skat was developed by the members of the brommesche tarok-gesellschaft michael dummett , sylvia mann , the game of tarot : from ferrara to salt lake city , p it is based on the three-player game of tarock , also known as tarot , and the four-player game of schafkopf ( equivalent to the american game sheepshead ) 254 , oxford university press ( 1996 ) , it has become the most loved and widely played german card game , especially in german-speaking regions international skat order , international skat players assoc 15apr2007 in the earliest known form of the game , the player in the first seat was dealt twelve cards and the other two players ten each david parlett , teach yourself card games , p 191 , mcgraw-hill ( 2003 ) , but the main innovation of this new game was that of the bidding ( cards ) the first book on the rules of skat was published in 1848 by a secondary school teacher j 7 , 8 , 162 , averill press ( 2008 ) , nevertheless , the rules continued to differ from one region to another until the first attempt to set them in order was made by a congress of skat players on 7 august 1886 in altenburg the current rules , followed by both the ispa and the german skat federation , date from jan encyclopædia britannica skat the word skat is a tarok term robert machenry , philip w 378 , ( 1897 ) the word scarto is still used in some other italian card games to this day , and is not to be confused with the american game called scat at the beginning of each round , or '' deal '' , one player becomes declarer and the other two players become the defending team the game can also be played by four players each card has a card value ( except in null games ) and is worth that number of points for the player winning the trick the declarer 's goal is to take at least 61 points in tricks in order to win that round of the game if the declarer wins they are awarded a positive score , if they lose the score is doubled and subtracted from the declarer 's tally ( i.e dealing follows this pattern : deal three cards each , then deal the skat , then four cards each , then three cards again ( '' three–skat–four–three '' ) often this does not become obvious before the player picks up the skat , or even not before the end of the game in question ( in case of a hand game , when the skat is not picked up ) the skat always belongs to the declarer , and if it contains certain high cards this may change the game value in a suit game , one of the four suits is the trump suit each suit has a base value , as follows : : the highest-ranking cards for taking the tricks ( the jacks ) are not the highest scoring cards the aces and 10s combined make up almost three quarters of the total points ; taking as many as possible of them is thus imperative for winning to win a null game , declarer must not take a single trick there are no card points in a null game even with the majority in card points , declarer may still lose if the game value is lower than the value he bid during the bidding unless they manage to play at least schneider ( raising the game value to 36 ) , or make a game other than clubs with a game value of at least 30 , the game will be lost they can try to minimize their loss by declaring a game in hearts instead of clubs ( base value 10 instead of 12 ) for a won game , that score is added to declarer 's tally the game value is 24 × ( 2 + 1 ) 72 points the skat is given to the player with the highest score grand guckser is the only game in north american skat where declarer picks up both skat cards at once card points are the same as in german skat : a 11 , 10 10 , k 4 , q 3 ramsch : player taking the fewest card points wins 10 game points , or 20 for taking zero tricks as in german skat , game points in north american skat are tallied by multiplying base game value by : 1 for each top trump , either with or without , plus : 1 for game ( 61 or more card points )

it is based on the three-player game of tarock , also known as tarot , and the four-player game of schafkopf ( equivalent to the american game sheepshead ) 254 , oxford university press ( 1996 ) , it has become the most loved and widely played german card game , especially in german-speaking regions international skat order , international skat players assoc 15apr2007 in the earliest known form of the game , the player in the first seat was dealt twelve cards and the other two players ten each 191 , mcgraw-hill ( 2003 ) , but the main innovation of this new game was that of the bidding ( cards ) : note : because of the many variations in the rules of skat , the rules below are necessarily general , although rules not found in official german tournament play are marked as such skat is a game for three players , who are known as forehand , middlehand and rearhand , rearhand also being the dealer ( see picture ) at the beginning of each round , or '' deal '' , one player becomes declarer and the other two players become the defending team the two defenders are not allowed to communicate in any way except by their choice of cards to play a central aspect of the game is the three coexisting varieties called '' suit '' , '' grand '' and '' null '' games , that differ in suit order , scoring and even overall goal to achieve each round of the game starts with a bidding phase to determine the declarer and the required minimum game value ( explained below ) each card has a card value ( except in null games ) and is worth that number of points for the player winning the trick in tournaments a winning declarer gets an additional 50 points if they win , if the defending team wins however they receive 40 points each in addition to the declarer losing twice the game 's value in points dealing follows this pattern : deal three cards each , then deal the skat , then four cards each , then three cards again ( '' three–skat–four–three '' ) he or she may peek into the hand of one other player ( if allowed to do so ) but never into the skat often this does not become obvious before the player picks up the skat , or even not before the end of the game in question ( in case of a hand game , when the skat is not picked up ) the bidding may also give away some information about what cards a player may or may not hold the game value ( also called hand value , is what the game will be worth after all tricks have been played the game value is determined by the type of the game and the game level as explained below for the suit , grand and null games each suit has a base value , as follows : : the highest-ranking cards for taking the tricks ( the jacks ) are not the highest scoring cards to win a null game , declarer must not take a single trick null games are often not played through to the end , either because declarer is forced to take a trick , ending the game prematurely , or because it becomes apparent to the defenders that they will be forced to take the rest of the tricks even with the majority in card points , declarer may still lose if the game value is lower than the value he bid during the bidding an overbid hand is scored by determining the lowest possible game value that is a multiple of the base value of declarer 's suit ( or 24 in case of a grand ) which is at least as high as declarer 's bid example : declarer bids 30 , missing the two top trumps ( without 2 ) , intending to play a club suit game ( game value would be 12 × 3 36 ) they will receive a negative score of −72 ( 36 is the lowest multiple of 12 , the base value of clubs , greater than the 30 they bid ; 36 times two is 72 ) this will be worth only −60 points , unless opponents score schneider against them the score to be awarded is the actual game value how high the player bid during the bidding is immaterial , as long as the game value is at least as high as declarer 's bid ( see overbid hands above ) note that often the score will be higher than the bidding value , because players typically do not bid as high as their hand would allow if one player takes no tricks at all ( jungfrau , , the points of the losing hand are doubled otherwise the hand is played as passt mir nicht ( it does n't suit me ) and the other card in the skat is turned up to determine trump ; grand guckser : declarer picks up both of the skat cards , adds them to his or her hand and discards two grand guckser is the only game in north american skat where declarer picks up both skat cards at once as in german skat , game points in north american skat are tallied by multiplying base game value by : 1 for each top trump , either with or without , plus : 1 for game ( 61 or more card points )

trepanation is perhaps the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence , and in some areas may have been quite widespread at one burial site in france dated to 6500 bce , 40 out of 120 prehistoric skulls found had trepanation holes many prehistoric and premodern patients had signs of their skull structure healing , suggesting that many of those subjected to the surgery survived another skull with a trepanation hole was found at burial site chalaghantepe ( agdam rayon , azerbaijan ) dated to the 5th millennium bce more than 1,500 trephined skulls from the neolithic period ( representing 5 to 10 % of all stone age skulls ) have been uncovered throughout the worldfrom europe , siberia , china and the americas a cow skull dating to 3400-3000 bce upon which trepanation had been performed was discovered in france several mesoamerican cultures used a skull-rack ( known by its nahuatl term , tzompantli ) , on which skulls were impaled in rows or columns of wooden stakes instead , the pre-columbian maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull , thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it , similar to the examples from cholula many skulls from the maya region date from the postclassic period ( ca 950–1400 ce ) , and include specimens found at palenque in chiapas , and recovered from the sacred cenote at the prominent postclassic site of chichen itza in northern yucatán as recently as 2007 , archaeological evidence of trepanation in ancient china was nonexistent along with the discovery of these trepanned skulls , another collection of 13 trepanned skulls was discovered and dated to 3,000 years ago in 2015 , an intact 3,600-year-old mummy with a trepanned skull was discovered meanwhile , the oldest trepanned skull ( m382 ) analysed by han and chen was radiocarbon dated to around 5,000 years ago and discovered at the fuija site in guangrao , shandong the skull , which belonged to an adult male , exhibited a right parietal calvarial defect ( 31 x 25 & nbsp ; mm ) with evidence of scraping by a trephine-like tool the only known female with a trepanned skull , shown signs of bone spurs growth and retraction of the edges suggest that she also survived the surgery the hair may or may not have been shaved depending upon the site of the operation along with antisepsis and prophylaxis of infection , modern neurosurgery is a common procedure for many reasons other than head trauma the trepanation surgical procedure includes exposure of the dura mater without damaging the underlying blood vessels , meninges , and brain there is evidence of bone remodelling around the skull defects , corroborated by the smooth borders around the opening , sealed by a dense cortex of bone , denoting procedural success after trepanation '' like a hole in the head : the return of trepanation '' february 2 , 2014 , at the wayback machine a prominent proponent of the modern view is peter halvorson , who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase '' brain blood volume '' at last ! feilding also performed a self-trepanation with a drill , while mellen shot the operation for the short film '' heartbeat in the brain '' , which was long thought to have been lost

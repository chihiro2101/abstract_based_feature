trepanation is perhaps the oldest surgical procedure for which there is archaeological evidence , and in some areas may have been quite widespread at one burial site in france dated to 6500 bce , 40 out of 120 prehistoric skulls found had trepanation holes another skull with a trepanation hole was found at burial site chalaghantepe ( agdam rayon , azerbaijan ) dated to the 5th millennium bce more than 1,500 trephined skulls from the neolithic period ( representing 5 to 10 % of all stone age skulls ) have been uncovered throughout the worldfrom europe , siberia , china and the americas a cow skull dating to 3400-3000 bce upon which trepanation had been performed was discovered in france in the more recent times of postclassical pre-columbian mesoamerica , evidence for the practice of trepanation and an assortment of other cranial deformation techniques comes from a variety of sources , including physical cranial remains of burials , allusions in iconographic artworks and reports from the post-colonial period several mesoamerican cultures used a skull-rack ( known by its nahuatl term , tzompantli ) , on which skulls were impaled in rows or columns of wooden stakes the earliest archaeological survey published of trepanated crania was a late 19th-century study of several specimens recovered from the tarahumara mountains by the norwegian ethnographer carl lumholtz a study of ten low-status burials from the late classic period at monte albán concluded that the trepanation had been applied non-therapeutically , and , since multiple techniques had been used and since some people had received more than one trepanation , concluded it had been done experimentally instead , the pre-columbian maya apparently used an abrasive technique that ground away at the back of the skull , thinning the bone and sometimes perforating it , similar to the examples from cholula 950–1400 ce ) , and include specimens found at palenque in chiapas , and recovered from the sacred cenote at the prominent postclassic site of chichen itza in northern yucatán since chinese culture mainly focuses only on traditional chinese medicine that usually entails non-surgical treatments such as acupuncture , balancing qigong , cupping , herbal medicine , etc along with the discovery of these trepanned skulls , another collection of 13 trepanned skulls was discovered and dated to 3,000 years ago meanwhile , the oldest trepanned skull ( m382 ) analysed by han and chen was radiocarbon dated to around 5,000 years ago and discovered at the fuija site in guangrao , shandong the skull , which belonged to an adult male , exhibited a right parietal calvarial defect ( 31 x 25 & nbsp ; mm ) with evidence of scraping by a trephine-like tool the only known female with a trepanned skull , shown signs of bone spurs growth and retraction of the edges suggest that she also survived the surgery the bronze age was found to be a period with the largest number of trepanned skulls in ancient china hippocrates gave specific directions on the procedure from its evolution through the greek age , and galen also elaborates on the procedure the trepanation surgical procedure includes exposure of the dura mater without damaging the underlying blood vessels , meninges , and brain the procedure comes with severe repercussions such as direct or indirect perioperative complications , which include increased damage to the brain , infection , blood loss , hemorrhage , and potentially death due to the trauma as the skull 's protective covering is compromised a prominent proponent of the modern view is peter halvorson , who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase '' brain blood volume '' huges claimed that trepanning increases '' brain blood volume '' and thereby enhances cerebral metabolism in a manner similar to cerebral vasodilators such as ginkgo biloba at last ! feilding also performed a self-trepanation with a drill , while mellen shot the operation for the short film '' heartbeat in the brain '' , which was long thought to have been lost

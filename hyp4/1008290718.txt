abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade back : the edge opposite the toothed edge fleam : the angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter the kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser 's power and type of material being cut points per inch ( 25 mm ) : the most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade there is always one more point per inch than there are teeth per inch ( e.g some saws do not have the same number of teeth per inch throughout their entire length , but the vast majority do barley , simon '' british saws and saw makers from c1660 , 2014 rake : the angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw in most modern serrated saws , the teeth are set , so that the kerf ( the width of the cut ) will be wider than the blade itself this allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding ( getting stuck ) the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart a '' flush-cutting saw '' has no set on one side , so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set teeth : sharp protrusions along the cutting side of the saw toothed edge : the edge with the teeth ( on some saws both edges are toothed ) web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges the 1st dynasty tombs of saqqara in egypt by john watson saws have been used for cutting a variety of materials , including humans ( death by sawing ) as the saw developed , teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side , rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set '' the identities of the axe , adz , chisel , and saw were clearly established more than 4,000 years ago it was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit , either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards 1 , p 191 with either a handle on each end or a frame saw hand saws typically have a relatively thick blade to make them stiff enough to cut through material a class of saws for cutting all types of material ; they may be small or large and the frame may be wood or metal table saw : a saw with a circular blade rising through a slot in a table '' a heavier , more precise and powerful version , driven by several belts , with an enclosed base stand , is called a '' cabinet saw '' radial arm saw : a versatile machine , mainly for cross-cutting abrasive saw : a circular or reciprocating saw-like tool with an abrasive disc rather than a toothed blade , commonly used for cutting very hard materials hole saw : ring-shaped saw to attach to a power drill , used for cutting a circular hole in material ; plytooth blade : a circular saw blade with many small teeth , designed for cutting plywood with minimal splintering hss saw blades are mainly used to cut steel , copper , aluminum and other metal materials

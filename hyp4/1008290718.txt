abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade back : the edge opposite the toothed edge fleam : the angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut although the term '' kerf '' is often used informally , to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade , or to the width of the set , this can be misleading , because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter the kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser 's power and type of material being cut points per inch ( 25 mm ) : the most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade some saws do not have the same number of teeth per inch throughout their entire length , but the vast majority do those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth , in order to make starting the saw cut easier barley , simon '' british saws and saw makers from c1660 , 2014 rake : the angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set teeth : sharp protrusions along the cutting side of the saw teeth per inch : an alternative measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade toothed edge : the edge with the teeth ( on some saws both edges are toothed ) web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges emery excavations at saqqara , the tomb of hemaka and hor-aha , cairo , government press , bul√¢q , 1938 ( 2 vols ) many copper saws were found in tomb no as the saw developed , teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side , rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set kline translation , electronic text center at university of virginia library talos , the nephew of daedalus , invented the saw once mankind had learned how to use iron , it became the preferred material for saw blades of all kinds ; some cultures learned how to harden the surface ( '' case hardening '' or '' steeling '' ) , prolonging the blade 's life and sharpness steel , made of iron with moderate carbon content and hardened by quenching hot steel in water , was used as early as 1200 bc jones & simons , story of the saw , p15 by the end of the 17th century european manufacture centred on germany , ( the bergisches land ) in london , and the midlands of england a pit saw was a two-man rip saw a class of saws for cutting all types of material ; they may be small or large and the frame may be wood or metal circular saw : a saw with a circular blade which spins pendulum saw or '' swing saw '' : a saw hung on a swinging arm , for the rough crosscut saw of wood in a sawmill and for cutting ice out of a frozen river frame saw or sash saw : a thin bladed rip-saw held in tension by a frame used both manually and in sawmills ; rip cut : in woodworking , a cut made parallel to the direction of the grain of the workpiece ; dado blade : a special type of circular saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint hss saw blades are mainly used to cut steel , copper , aluminum and other metal materials : ; solid-carbide saw blades : the whole saw blade is made of tungsten carbide

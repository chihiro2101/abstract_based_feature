abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade back : the edge opposite the toothed edge fleam : the angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut although the term '' kerf '' is often used informally , to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade , or to the width of the set , this can be misleading , because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter the kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser 's power and type of material being cut those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth , in order to make starting the saw cut easier teeth designed to cut with the grain ( ripping ) are generally steeper than teeth designed to cut across the grain ( crosscutting ) set : the degree to which the teeth are bent out sideways away from the blade , usually in both directions in most modern serrated saws , the teeth are set , so that the kerf ( the width of the cut ) will be wider than the blade itself the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set teeth per inch : an alternative measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade toothed edge : the edge with the teeth ( on some saws both edges are toothed ) emery excavations at saqqara , the tomb of hemaka and hor-aha , cairo , government press , bul√¢q , 1938 ( 2 vols ) many copper saws were found in tomb no particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types egyptian saws were at first serrated , hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes as the saw developed , teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side , rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set '' the identities of the axe , adz , chisel , and saw were clearly established more than 4,000 years ago once mankind had learned how to use iron , it became the preferred material for saw blades of all kinds ; some cultures learned how to harden the surface ( '' case hardening '' or '' steeling '' ) , prolonging the blade 's life and sharpness steel , made of iron with moderate carbon content and hardened by quenching hot steel in water , was used as early as 1200 bc barley , ibid p42 the us industry began to overtake it in the last decades of the century , due to superior mechanisation , better marketing , a large domestic market , and the imposition of high tariffs on imports by the mid 18th century rolling the metal was usual , the power for the rolls being supplied first by water , and increasingly by the early 19th century by steam engines most hand saws are today entirely made without human intervention , with the steel plate supplied ready rolled to thickness and tensioned before being cut to shape by laser country relics ; an account of some old tools and properties once belonging to english craftsmen and husbandmen saved from destruction and now described with their users and their stories concrete saw : ( usually powered by an internal combustion engine and fitted with a diamond blade ) for cutting concrete or asphalt pavement abrasive saw : a circular or reciprocating saw-like tool with an abrasive disc rather than a toothed blade , commonly used for cutting very hard materials a crosscut saw is used to make this type of cut ; strobe saw blade : a circular saw blade with special rakers/cutters to easily saw through green or uncured wood that tends to jam other kinds of saw blades ; diamond : fixed onto the saw blade 's base to form diamond blade hss saw blades are mainly used to cut steel , copper , aluminum and other metal materials carbide-tipped saw blades are widely used to cut wood , plywood , laminated board , plastic , glass , aluminum and some other metals

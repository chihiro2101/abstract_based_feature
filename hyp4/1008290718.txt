abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade back : the edge opposite the toothed edge the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut although the term '' kerf '' is often used informally , to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade , or to the width of the set , this can be misleading , because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter the kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser 's power and type of material being cut points per inch ( 25 mm ) : the most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade there is always one more point per inch than there are teeth per inch ( e.g , a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch , and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch ) those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth , in order to make starting the saw cut easier barley , simon '' british saws and saw makers from c1660 , 2014 rake : the angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw teeth designed to cut with the grain ( ripping ) are generally steeper than teeth designed to cut across the grain ( crosscutting ) set : the degree to which the teeth are bent out sideways away from the blade , usually in both directions the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set teeth : sharp protrusions along the cutting side of the saw toothed edge : the edge with the teeth ( on some saws both edges are toothed ) web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges the earliest known sawmill is the roman hierapolis sawmill from the third century ad and was for sawing stone in archeological reality , saws date back to prehistory and most probably evolved from neolithic stone or bone tools by the mid 18th century rolling the metal was usual , the power for the rolls being supplied first by water , and increasingly by the early 19th century by steam engines the industry gradually mechanized all the processes , including the important grinding the saw plate '' thin to the back '' by a fraction of an inch , which helped the saw to pass through the kerf without binding ( moxon , ibid , p95 ) most hand saws are today entirely made without human intervention , with the steel plate supplied ready rolled to thickness and tensioned before being cut to shape by laser it was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit , either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards the pit saw was '' a strong steel cutting-plate , of great breadth , with large teeth , highly polished and thoroughly wrought , some eight or ten feet in length '' charles w '' back saws '' which have a thin blade backed with steel or brass to maintain rigidity , are a subset of hand saws circular saw : a saw with a circular blade which spins circular saws can be large for use in a mill or hand held up to 24 '' blades and different designs cut almost any kind of material including wood , stone , brick , plastic , etc pendulum saw or '' swing saw '' : a saw hung on a swinging arm , for the rough crosscut saw of wood in a sawmill and for cutting ice out of a frozen river most blade teeth are made either of tool steel or carbide ; crosscut : in woodworking , a cut made at ( or close to ) a right angle to the direction of the wood grain of the workpiece ; dado blade : a special type of circular saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint : ; solid-carbide saw blades : the whole saw blade is made of tungsten carbide

abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade fleam : the angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw kerf : the narrow channel left behind by the saw and ( relatedly ) the measure of its width the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut for example , a too-thin blade can cause excessive wobble , creating a wider-than-expected kerf the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter the kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser 's power and type of material being cut points per inch ( 25 mm ) : the most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade , a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch , and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch ) those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth , in order to make starting the saw cut easier in most modern serrated saws , the teeth are set , so that the kerf ( the width of the cut ) will be wider than the blade itself this allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding ( getting stuck ) the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart a '' flush-cutting saw '' has no set on one side , so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set teeth per inch : an alternative measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges saws were at first serrated materials such as flint , obsidian , sea shells and shark teeth simons , '' story of the saw '' spear and jackson limited 1760-1960 in ancient egypt , open ( unframed ) saws made of copper are documented as early as the early dynastic period , circa 3,100–2,686 bc emery excavations at saqqara , the tomb of hemaka and hor-aha , cairo , government press , bulâq , 1938 ( 2 vols ) many copper saws were found in tomb no in the iron age , frame saws were developed holding the thin blades in tension lu ban and the invention of the saw history anecdote at cultural china website in greek mythology , as recounted by ovid , ovid metamorphoses bk viii:236-259 : the death of talos a the teeth were sharpened with a triangular file of appropriate size , and set with a hammer or a wrest ( moxon , ibid ) a pit saw was a two-man rip saw if set on steel legs , it is called a '' contractor 's saw rotary saw or '' spiral-cut saw '' or '' rotozip '' : for making accurate cuts , without using a pilot hole , in wallboard , plywood , and other thin materials electric miter saw or '' chop saw , '' or '' cut-off saw '' or '' power miter box '' : for making accurate cross cuts and miter cuts looks like a mulay saw but sharpened as a cross-cut saw ; band saw blade : a long band welded into a circle , with teeth on one side ; diamond : fixed onto the saw blade 's base to form diamond blade carbide-tipped saw blades are widely used to cut wood , plywood , laminated board , plastic , glass , aluminum and some other metals comparing with hss saw blades , solid-carbide saw blades have higher hardness under high temperatures , and are more durable , but they also have a lower toughness

abrasive saw : a saw that cuts with an abrasive disc or band , rather than a toothed blade fleam : the angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw the kerf depends on several factors : the width of the saw blade ; the set of the blade 's teeth ; the amount of wobble created during cutting ; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut although the term '' kerf '' is often used informally , to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade , or to the width of the set , this can be misleading , because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs for example , a too-thin blade can cause excessive wobble , creating a wider-than-expected kerf the kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter the kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser 's power and type of material being cut points per inch ( 25 mm ) : the most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade , a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch , and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch ) those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth , in order to make starting the saw cut easier barley , simon '' british saws and saw makers from c1660 , 2014 rake : the angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw teeth designed to cut with the grain ( ripping ) are generally steeper than teeth designed to cut across the grain ( crosscutting ) set : the degree to which the teeth are bent out sideways away from the blade , usually in both directions in most modern serrated saws , the teeth are set , so that the kerf ( the width of the cut ) will be wider than the blade itself the set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make for example , a rip saw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel , so that it rips or tears the material apart the set of the blade 's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set teeth : sharp protrusions along the cutting side of the saw teeth per inch : an alternative measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade web : a narrow saw blade held in a frame , worked either by hand or in a machine , sometimes with teeth on both edges the 1st dynasty tombs of saqqara in egypt by john watson saws have been used for cutting a variety of materials , including humans ( death by sawing ) egyptian saws were at first serrated , hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes as the saw developed , teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side , rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set by the mid 18th century rolling the metal was usual , the power for the rolls being supplied first by water , and increasingly by the early 19th century by steam engines the industry gradually mechanized all the processes , including the important grinding the saw plate '' thin to the back '' by a fraction of an inch , which helped the saw to pass through the kerf without binding ( moxon , ibid , p95 ) most hand saws are today entirely made without human intervention , with the steel plate supplied ready rolled to thickness and tensioned before being cut to shape by laser a pit saw was a two-man rip saw a class of saws for cutting all types of material ; they may be small or large and the frame may be wood or metal electric miter saw or '' chop saw , '' or '' cut-off saw '' or '' power miter box '' : for making accurate cross cuts and miter cuts a '' sliding compound miter saw '' has a blade that can be pulled through the work , in an action similar to that of a radial-arm saw , which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces frame saw or sash saw : a thin bladed rip-saw held in tension by a frame used both manually and in sawmills ; dado blade : a special type of circular saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint hss saw blades are mainly used to cut steel , copper , aluminum and other metal materials carbide-tipped saw blades are widely used to cut wood , plywood , laminated board , plastic , glass , aluminum and some other metals

the thyristor is a four-layered , three-terminal semiconductor device , with each layer consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material , for example p-n-p-n the control terminal , called the gate , is attached to p-type material near the cathode the thyristor has three p-n junctions ( serially named j 1 , j 2 , j 3 from the anode ) when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased now if v ak is increased beyond the breakdown voltage v bo of the thyristor , avalanche breakdown of j 2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting ( on state ) once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer the gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage ( v gt ) and gate trigger current ( i gt ) gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor in a conventional thyristor , once it has been switched on by the gate terminal , the device remains latched in the on-state ( i.e as long as the anode remains positively biased , it can not be switched off unless the current drops below the holding current ( i h ) a thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased ( a method known as natural , or line , commutation ) in some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the anode of the first thyristor after the current in a thyristor has extinguished , a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased and retain the thyristor in the off-state the device can be said to operate synchronously ; being that , once the device is triggered , it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required , i.e snubbers are energy-absorbing circuits used to suppress the voltage spikes caused by the circuit 's inductance when a switch , electrical or mechanical , opens since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of megawatts , thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) conversion either to or from alternating current the boundary of this region is partly determined by the requirement that the maximum permissible gate power ( p g ) , specified for a given trigger pulse duration , is not exceeded switch on dv/dt – the thyristor can be spuriously fired without trigger from the gate if the anode-to-cathode voltage rise-rate is too great a reverse conducting thyristor ( rct ) has an integrated reverse diode , so is not capable of reverse blocking

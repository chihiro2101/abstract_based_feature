the thyristor is a four-layered , three-terminal semiconductor device , with each layer consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material , for example p-n-p-n the control terminal , called the gate , is attached to p-type material near the cathode the thyristor has three p-n junctions ( serially named j 1 , j 2 , j 3 from the anode ) when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased now if v ak is increased beyond the breakdown voltage v bo of the thyristor , avalanche breakdown of j 2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting ( on state ) once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer the gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage ( v gt ) and gate trigger current ( i gt ) gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state ) , providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current ( i l ) in some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the anode of the first thyristor after the current in a thyristor has extinguished , a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased and retain the thyristor in the off-state the silicon controlled rectifier ( scr ) or thyristor proposed by william shockley in 1950 and championed by moll and others at bell labs was developed in 1956 by power engineers at general electric ( g.e thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved , and are often used to control alternating currents , where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically , referred to as '' zero cross '' operation a thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate , and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage , the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground ( in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse ) the first large-scale application of thyristors , with associated triggering diac , in consumer products related to stabilized power supplies within color television receivers in the early 1970s since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of megawatts , thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) conversion either to or from alternating current forced commutation – in which the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse breakdown voltage of the gate cathode diode junction ( scrs only ) switch on dv/dt – the thyristor can be spuriously fired without trigger from the gate if the anode-to-cathode voltage rise-rate is too great light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage ( vbo ) protection , which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high ; they have also been made with in-built forward recovery protection , but not commercially

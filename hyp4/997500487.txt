the thyristor is a four-layered , three-terminal semiconductor device , with each layer consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material , for example p-n-p-n the thyristor has three p-n junctions ( serially named j 1 , j 2 , j 3 from the anode ) when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased now if v ak is increased beyond the breakdown voltage v bo of the thyristor , avalanche breakdown of j 2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting ( on state ) if a positive potential v g is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode , the breakdown of the junction j 2 occurs at a lower value of v ak by selecting an appropriate value of v g , the thyristor can be switched into the on state quickly once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer the gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage ( v gt ) and gate trigger current ( i gt ) gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor in a conventional thyristor , once it has been switched on by the gate terminal , the device remains latched in the on-state ( i.e does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state ) , providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current ( i l ) a thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased ( a method known as natural , or line , commutation ) in some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the anode of the first thyristor an earlier gas-filled tube device called a thyratron provided a similar electronic switching capability , where a small control voltage could switch a large current the device can be said to operate synchronously ; being that , once the device is triggered , it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required , i.e snubbers are energy-absorbing circuits used to suppress the voltage spikes caused by the circuit 's inductance when a switch , electrical or mechanical , opens thyristor manufacturers generally specify a region of safe firing defining acceptable levels of voltage and current for a given operating temperature switch on dv/dt – the thyristor can be spuriously fired without trigger from the gate if the anode-to-cathode voltage rise-rate is too great triac – triode for alternating current – a bidirectional switching device containing two thyristor structures with common gate contact quadrac – special type of thyristor which combines a diac and a triac into a single package

the thyristor is a four-layered , three-terminal semiconductor device , with each layer consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material , for example p-n-p-n when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased now if v ak is increased beyond the breakdown voltage v bo of the thyristor , avalanche breakdown of j 2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting ( on state ) if a positive potential v g is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode , the breakdown of the junction j 2 occurs at a lower value of v ak once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer the gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage ( v gt ) and gate trigger current ( i gt ) gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state ) , providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current ( i l ) in normal working conditions the latching current is always greater than holding current in some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the anode of the first thyristor after the current in a thyristor has extinguished , a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased and retain the thyristor in the off-state thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved , and are often used to control alternating currents , where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically , referred to as '' zero cross '' operation the device can be said to operate synchronously ; being that , once the device is triggered , it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required , i.e they can also be found in power supplies for digital circuits , where they are used as a sort of '' enhanced circuit breaker '' to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components a thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate , and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage , the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground ( in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse ) this kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar , and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of megawatts , thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current ( hvdc ) conversion either to or from alternating current forced commutation – in which the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse breakdown voltage of the gate cathode diode junction ( scrs only ) triac – triode for alternating current – a bidirectional switching device containing two thyristor structures with common gate contact quadrac – special type of thyristor which combines a diac and a triac into a single package

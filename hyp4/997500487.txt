the thyristor is a four-layered , three-terminal semiconductor device , with each layer consisting of alternately n-type or p-type material , for example p-n-p-n the control terminal , called the gate , is attached to p-type material near the cathode the thyristor has three p-n junctions ( serially named j 1 , j 2 , j 3 from the anode ) when the anode is at a positive potential v ak with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate , junctions j 1 and j 3 are forward biased , while junction j 2 is reverse biased now if v ak is increased beyond the breakdown voltage v bo of the thyristor , avalanche breakdown of j 2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting ( on state ) if a positive potential v g is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode , the breakdown of the junction j 2 occurs at a lower value of v ak once avalanche breakdown has occurred , the thyristor continues to conduct , irrespective of the gate voltage , until : ( a ) the potential v ak is removed or ( b ) the current through the device ( anode−cathode ) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer the gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage ( v gt ) and gate trigger current ( i gt ) gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state ) , providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current ( i l ) as long as the anode remains positively biased , it can not be switched off unless the current drops below the holding current ( i h ) in normal working conditions the latching current is always greater than holding current in some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the anode of the first thyristor after the current in a thyristor has extinguished , a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased and retain the thyristor in the off-state the device can be said to operate synchronously ; being that , once the device is triggered , it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required , i.e they can also be found in power supplies for digital circuits , where they are used as a sort of '' enhanced circuit breaker '' to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components the gto thyristor and igct are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem triac – triode for alternating current – a bidirectional switching device containing two thyristor structures with common gate contact quadrac – special type of thyristor which combines a diac and a triac into a single package since no electronic boards need to be provided at the potential of the thyristor in order to trigger it , light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as hvdc

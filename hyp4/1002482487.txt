fibropapillomatosis is a benign tumour disease of marine turtles , predominantly in the green sea turtle , chelonia mydas , but it has also been reported in the loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta , olive ridley lepidochelys olivacea , kemp 's ridley lepidochelys kempii , and leatherbacks dermochelys coriacea around 25–30 % of turtles with external tumours also have internal tumours , primarily in heart , lungs and kidneys the tumours appear to be benign and can be present for many years , but if large , can mechanically hamper sight , swallowing , and swimming , which may ultimately be fatal long-term studies found no signs of the disease on florida 's atlantic coast in the 1970s , but during the 1980s fp was recorded in incidences varying from 28–67 % recent research has found that fp is caused by stress and tumours have been observed in turtles that are part of turtle tourism tours an alphaherpesvirus initially called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus ( fpthv ) , and now called chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 , is believed to be the causative agent of the disease the fpthv herpesvirus has been found in turtles free from fp and this suggest that the fp progression is multifactorial and might even involve some sort of tumour-promoting phase fp affects green sea turtle populations all over the world , making it a panzootic turtles are known to be robust to physical damage , but are surprisingly very susceptible to biological and chemical contaminants caused by anthropogenic activity

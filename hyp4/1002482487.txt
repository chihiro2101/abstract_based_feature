fp is most often found externally around the armpits , genitals , neck , eyes , and tails of turtles , but also occur in and around the mouth , and rarely in internal organs or on the carapace around 25–30 % of turtles with external tumours also have internal tumours , primarily in heart , lungs and kidneys the suggestions for this pattern include the tumours can regress and be cured , which has been documented in some individuals , even when tumours were severe recent research has found that fp is caused by stress and tumours have been observed in turtles that are part of turtle tourism tours an alphaherpesvirus initially called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus ( fpthv ) , and now called chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 , is believed to be the causative agent of the disease the fpthv herpesvirus has been found in turtles free from fp and this suggest that the fp progression is multifactorial and might even involve some sort of tumour-promoting phase again , causality has not been concluded , but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of fp , and as they are found on weeds , they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles the strongest association with fp is with habitat type , especially increased anthropogenic activity causing high-nitrogen footprints in a surrounding environment where green sea turtles are found the high prevalence of fp is also associated with habitats ’ poor quality , while fp is absent in some habitats of good quality

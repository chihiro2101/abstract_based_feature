around 25–30 % of turtles with external tumours also have internal tumours , primarily in heart , lungs and kidneys the suggestions for this pattern include the tumours can regress and be cured , which has been documented in some individuals , even when tumours were severe the first documented case of the disease was in 1938 in key west , florida long-term studies found no signs of the disease on florida 's atlantic coast in the 1970s , but during the 1980s fp was recorded in incidences varying from 28–67 % an alphaherpesvirus initially called fibropapilloma-associated turtle herpesvirus ( fpthv ) , and now called chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 , is believed to be the causative agent of the disease the fpthv herpesvirus has been found in turtles free from fp and this suggest that the fp progression is multifactorial and might even involve some sort of tumour-promoting phase again , causality has not been concluded , but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of fp , and as they are found on weeds , they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles fp affects green sea turtle populations all over the world , making it a panzootic it is especially found in warmer climates , such as the caribbean , hawaii , japan , and australia , where up to 70 % of individuals in a population have fp

fibropapillomatosis is a benign tumour disease of marine turtles , predominantly in the green sea turtle , chelonia mydas , but it has also been reported in the loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta , olive ridley lepidochelys olivacea , kemp 's ridley lepidochelys kempii , and leatherbacks dermochelys coriacea around 25â€“30 % of turtles with external tumours also have internal tumours , primarily in heart , lungs and kidneys the tumours appear to be benign and can be present for many years , but if large , can mechanically hamper sight , swallowing , and swimming , which may ultimately be fatal recent research has found that fp is caused by stress and tumours have been observed in turtles that are part of turtle tourism tours the fpthv herpesvirus has been found in turtles free from fp and this suggest that the fp progression is multifactorial and might even involve some sort of tumour-promoting phase these leeches are common turtle ectoparasites that exclusively feed on turtle blood , and some leeches have been found carrying more than 10 million copies of the herpesvirus dna again , causality has not been concluded , but an association seems to exist between the distribution of especially the dinoflagellates and the occurrence of fp , and as they are found on weeds , they can be ingested by foraging green sea turtles fp affects green sea turtle populations all over the world , making it a panzootic the strongest association with fp is with habitat type , especially increased anthropogenic activity causing high-nitrogen footprints in a surrounding environment where green sea turtles are found

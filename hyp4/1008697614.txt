ghz according to these experts , the pentium 4 was released because the competing thunderbird-based amd athlon was outperforming the aging pentium iii , and further improvements to the pentium iii were not yet possible this pentium 4 was produced using a 180 & nbsp ; nm process and initially used socket 423 ( also called socket w , for '' willamette '' ) , with later revisions moving to socket 478 ( socket n , for '' northwood '' ) the pentium iii remained intel 's top selling processor line , with the athlon also selling slightly better than the pentium 4 while intel bundled two rdram modules with each boxed pentium 4 , it did not facilitate pentium 4 sales and was not considered a true solution by many in april 2001 a 1.7 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 was launched , the first model to provide performance clearly superior to the old pentium iii july saw 1.6 and 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz models and in august 2001 , intel released 1.9 and 2 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4s in january 2002 , intel released pentium 4s with a new core code named '' northwood '' at speeds of 1.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 1.8 & nbsp ; ghz , 2 & nbsp ; ghz and 2.2 & nbsp ; ghz northwood ( product code 80532 ) combined an increase in the l2 & nbsp ; cache size from 256 & nbsp ; kb to 512 & nbsp ; kb ( increasing the transistor count from 42 million to 55 million ) with a transition to a new 130 & nbsp ; nm fabrication process in the same month boards utilizing the 845 chipset were released with enabled support for ddr sdram which provided double the bandwidth of pc133 sdram , and alleviated the associated high costs of using rambus rdram for maximal performance with pentium 4 this initial 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz 533fsb pentium 4 hyper-threading enabled processor was known as pentium 4 ht and was introduced to mass market by gateway in november 2002 this processor used an 800 & nbsp ; mt/s fsb ( 200 & nbsp ; mhz physical clock ) , was clocked at 3 & nbsp ; ghz , and had hyper-threading technology this was meant to help the pentium 4 better compete with amd 's opteron line of processors meanwhile , with the launch of the athlon xp 3200+ in amd 's desktop line , amd increased the athlon xp 's fsb speed from 333 & nbsp ; mt/s to 400 & nbsp ; mt/s , but it was not enough to hold off the new 3 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 ht intel 's naming conventions made it difficult at the time of the processor 's release to identify the processor model there was the pentium iii mobile chip , the mobile pentium 4-m , the mobile pentium 4 , and then just the pentium m which itself was based on the pentium iii and significantly faster than the former three however , according to intel specifications , the pentium 4-m had a maximum thermal junction temperature rating of 100 degrees c , approximately 40 degrees higher than the desktop pentium 4 the mobile intel pentium 4 processor was released to address the problem of putting a full desktop pentium 4 processor into a laptop , which some manufacturers were doing in september 2003 , at the intel developer forum , the pentium 4 extreme edition ( p4ee ) was announced , just over a week before the launch of athlon 64 and athlon 64 fx a slight performance increase was achieved in late 2004 by increasing the bus speed from 800 & nbsp ; mt/s to 1066 & nbsp ; mt/s , resulting in a 3.46 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition the new 3.73 & nbsp ; ghz extreme edition had the same features as a 6x0-sequence prescott 2m , but with a 1066 & nbsp ; mt/s bus in practice however , the 3.73 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition , which is most likely due to the lack of an l3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline the only advantage the 3.73 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition had over the 3.46 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 extreme edition was the ability to run 64-bit applications since all gallatin-based pentium 4 extreme edition processors lacked the intel 64 instruction set plans to mass-produce a 4 & nbsp ; ghz pentium 4 were cancelled by intel in favor of dual core processors , although some european retailers claimed to be selling a pentium 4 580 , clocked at 4 & nbsp ; ghz it features intel 64 , the xd & nbsp ; bit , eist ( enhanced intel speedstep technology ) , tm2 ( for processors at 3.6 & nbsp ; ghz and above ) , and 2 & nbsp ; mb of l2 cache intel only released two models of this prescott 2m category : 662 and 672 , running at 3.6 & nbsp ; ghz and 3.8 & nbsp ; ghz , respectively it has a 65 & nbsp ; nm core and features the same 31-stage pipeline as prescott , 800 & nbsp ; mt/s fsb , intel 64 , hyper-threading , but no virtualization technology thus , pentium 4 631 , 641 , 651 and 661 are 65 & nbsp ; nm cedar mill microprocessors , while pentium 630 , 640 , 650 and 660 respectively are their 90 & nbsp ; nm prescott equivalents

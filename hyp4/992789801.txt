the diagram above shows the nine significant points of the nine-point circle points j , k , and l are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude 's vertex intersection ( points a , b , and c ) and the triangle 's orthocenter ( point s ) for an acute triangle , six of the points ( the midpoints and altitude feet ) lie on the triangle itself ; for an obtuse triangle two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle , but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle although he is credited for its discovery , karl wilhelm feuerbach did not entirely discover the nine-point circle , but rather the six-point circle , recognizing the significance of the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes of that triangle the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle figure 3 a nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle 's orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle figure 4 the center n of the nine-point circle bisects a segment from the orthocenter h to the circumcenter o ( making the orthocenter a center of dilation to both circles ) : posamentier , alfred s let \omega be the nine-point circle of the diagonal triangle of a cyclic quadrilateral the center of all rectangular hyperbolas that pass through the vertices of a triangle lies on its nine-point circle this is a consequence of symmetry : the sides of one triangle adjacent to a vertex that is an orthocenter to another triangle are segments from that second triangle a triangle 's circumcircle , its nine-point circle , its polar circle , and the circumcircle of its tangential triangle are coaxal

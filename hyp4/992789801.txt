the diagram above shows the nine significant points of the nine-point circle points j , k , and l are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude 's vertex intersection ( points a , b , and c ) and the triangle 's orthocenter ( point s ) for an acute triangle , six of the points ( the midpoints and altitude feet ) lie on the triangle itself ; for an obtuse triangle two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle , but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle although he is credited for its discovery , karl wilhelm feuerbach did not entirely discover the nine-point circle , but rather the six-point circle , recognizing the significance of the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes of that triangle the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle the radius of a triangle 's circumcircle is twice the radius of that triangle 's nine-point circle figure 3 a nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle 's orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle figure 4 the center n of the nine-point circle bisects a segment from the orthocenter h to the circumcenter o ( making the orthocenter a center of dilation to both circles ) : posamentier , alfred s the nine-point circle of a reference triangle is the circumcircle of both the reference triangle 's medial triangle ( with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of the reference triangle ) and its orthic triangle ( with vertices at the feet of the reference triangle 's altitudes ) consequently the four nine-point centers are cyclic and lie on a circle congruent to the four nine-point circles that is centered at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral a triangle 's circumcircle , its nine-point circle , its polar circle , and the circumcircle of its tangential triangle are coaxal

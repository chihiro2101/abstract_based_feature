the diagram above shows the nine significant points of the nine-point circle points j , k , and l are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude 's vertex intersection ( points a , b , and c ) and the triangle 's orthocenter ( point s ) for an acute triangle , six of the points ( the midpoints and altitude feet ) lie on the triangle itself ; for an obtuse triangle two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle , but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle the triangle center at which the incircle and the nine-point circle touch is called the feuerbach point the radius of a triangle 's circumcircle is twice the radius of that triangle 's nine-point circle figure 3 a nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle 's orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle furthermore the nine-point circle is the locus of p such that : :pa 2 +pb 2 +pc 2 +ph 2 & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 4r 2 if four points a , b , c , d are given that form a cyclic quadrilateral , then the nine-point circles of abc , bcd , cda and dab concur at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral consequently the four nine-point centers are cyclic and lie on a circle congruent to the four nine-point circles that is centered at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral a triangle 's circumcircle , its nine-point circle , its polar circle , and the circumcircle of its tangential triangle are coaxal

the diagram above shows the nine significant points of the nine-point circle points g , h , and i are the feet of the altitudes of the triangle points j , k , and l are the midpoints of the line segments between each altitude 's vertex intersection ( points a , b , and c ) and the triangle 's orthocenter ( point s ) for an acute triangle , six of the points ( the midpoints and altitude feet ) lie on the triangle itself ; for an obtuse triangle two of the altitudes have feet outside the triangle , but these feet still belong to the nine-point circle although he is credited for its discovery , karl wilhelm feuerbach did not entirely discover the nine-point circle , but rather the six-point circle , recognizing the significance of the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes of that triangle in 1822 karl feuerbach discovered that any triangle 's nine-point circle is externally tangent to that triangle 's three excircles and internally tangent to its incircle ; this result is known as feuerbach 's theorem the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle the radius of a triangle 's circumcircle is twice the radius of that triangle 's nine-point circle figure 3 a nine-point circle bisects a line segment going from the corresponding triangle 's orthocenter to any point on its circumcircle the center of all rectangular hyperbolas that pass through the vertices of a triangle lies on its nine-point circle consequently the four nine-point centers are cyclic and lie on a circle congruent to the four nine-point circles that is centered at the anticenter of the cyclic quadrilateral

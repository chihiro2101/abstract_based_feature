conventional traffic signal lighting , still common in some areas , utilizes a standard light bulb typically , a 67 , 69 , or 115 watt medium-base ( household lamp in the us ) light bulb provides the illumination light then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl , and out through a polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens in some signals , these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern in the united states , traffic lights are currently designed with lights approximately in diameter variations used have also included a hybrid design , which had one or more 12 & nbsp ; inch lights along with one or more lights of on the same light for example , these '' 12-8-8 '' ( along with 8-8-8 ) lights are standard in most jurisdictions in ontario , manitoba , and british columbia ( that , is , the red light is 12 and others 8 , making the red more prominent ) producing both bulb and led versions of the signal aspects , these signals are still the most common type of traffic light on uk roads with the invention of anti-phantom , highly visible aston lenses , lights of could be designed to give the same output as plain lenses , so a larger surface area was unnecessary with technologies in developed countries continuing to advance , there is now an increasing move to develop and implement smart traffic lights on the roads file : fort worth , tx traffic light - berry street and evans avenue.jpg an example of a wire-mounted traffic light in fort worth , texas file : silver line buses on washington street , may 2012.jpg a vertically mounted traffic light in boston file : traffic light at megasection.jpg a bulky tubular metal structure file : kop traffic light.jpg three horizontally mounted traffic lights for visibility under a bridge in king of prussia , pennsylvania in florida , horizontal signals mounted on poles , known as '' mast arms '' , are in wide use due to their lower wind profile , important for minimizing hurricane damage in areas where wind-load is not as much of a concern as ice-load , such as illinois or minnesota , the lights are mounted vertically to reduce the accumulation of ice or snow over the surface of the signal heads traffic signals in most areas of europe are located at the stop line on same side of the intersection as the approaching traffic ( there being both right- and left-hand traffic ) and are often mounted overhead as well as on side of the road at particularly busy junctions for freight , higher lights may be mounted specifically for lorry the traffic lights are mounted so that cyclists can still see them this is often done due to the pedestrian crossings , so that traffic has to wait if they get a red light in north america , there is often a pole-mounted signal on the same side of the intersection , but additional pole-mounted and overhead signals are usually mounted on the far side of the intersection for better visibility in ontario , traffic lights are almost always mounted on the far side of the intersection with poles some busy intersections have an overhead traffic light for heavy vehicles and vehicles further away traffic lights can increase the traffic capacity at intersections and reduce delay for side road traffic , but can also result in increased delay for main road traffic the traffic lights had been erected in the 1960s because of since-resolved protests over traffic criteria have been developed to help ensure that new traffic lights are installed only where they will do more good than harm , and to justify the removal of existing traffic lights where they are not warranted they are most often placed on arterial roads at intersections with either another arterial road or a collector road , or on an expressway where an interchange is not warranted in some situations , traffic signals can also be found on collector roads in busy settings if the traffic volume on a major street is so heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delays in attempting to cross it if the traffic density at school crossing times exceeds one per minute which is considered to provide too few gaps in the traffic for children to safely cross the street installing a traffic control signal at some intersections might be justified to encourage concentration and organization of traffic flow on a roadway network an intersection is usually required to meet one or more of these warrants before a signal is installed however , meeting one or more warrants does not require the installation of a traffic signal , it only suggests that they may be suitable there may be other unconsidered conditions that lead traffic engineers to conclude that a signal is undesirable in virtually all jurisdictions in which they are used , it is an offence for motorists ( and other road users ) to disobey traffic control devices , such as traffic lights in some jurisdictions , running an amber light may also incur a penalty some jurisdictions allow right turns when a steady red light is shown traffic lights have also been used in computer software , such as the macos user interface , and in pieces of artwork , particularly the traffic light tree in london , uk scuderia ferrari , a formula one racing team , formerly used a traffic light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers to when to leave the pits the christmas tree has six lights : a blue staging light , three amber lights , a green light and a red light

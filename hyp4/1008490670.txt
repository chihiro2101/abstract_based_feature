conventional traffic signal lighting , still common in some areas , utilizes a standard light bulb typically , a 67 , 69 , or 115 watt medium-base ( household lamp in the us ) light bulb provides the illumination light then bounces off a mirrored glass or polished aluminium reflector bowl , and out through a polycarbonate plastic or glass signal lens in some signals , these lenses were cut to include a specific refracting pattern in the 1930s throughout the 1950s , they utilized a beaded prismatic lens with a '' smiley '' pattern embossed into the bottom of each lens variations used have also included a hybrid design , which had one or more 12 & nbsp ; inch lights along with one or more lights of on the same light for example , these '' 12-8-8 '' ( along with 8-8-8 ) lights are standard in most jurisdictions in ontario , manitoba , and british columbia ( that , is , the red light is 12 and others 8 , making the red more prominent ) in the united kingdom , 12 & nbsp ; inch lights were implemented only with mellor design signal heads designed by david mellor however , following a study sponsored by the uk highways agency and completed by aston university , birmingham , uk , an enhanced optical design was introduced in the mid 1990s the manufacturers took a licence for the generic design from the highways agency , with dr aston engineering a unique solution for each manufacturer producing both bulb and led versions of the signal aspects , these signals are still the most common type of traffic light on uk roads consequently , lights of are no longer approved for use in the uk and all lights installed on new installations have to be in accordance with tsrgd ( traffic signs regulations and general directions ) there are significant differences from place to place in how traffic lights are mounted or positioned so that they are visible to drivers file : fort worth , tx traffic light -

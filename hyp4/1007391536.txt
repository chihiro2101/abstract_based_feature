in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount however , product heterogeneity , market frictions or high fixed costs ( which make marginal-cost pricing unsustainable in the long run ) can allow for some degree of differential pricing to different consumers , even in fully competitive retail or industrial markets even if output remains constant , price discrimination can reduce efficiency by misallocating output among consumers price discrimination requires market segmentation and some means to discourage discount customers from becoming resellers and , by extension , competitors this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information another example of price discrimination is intellectual property , enforced by law and by technology in the market for dvds , laws require dvd players to be designed and produced with hardware or software that prevents inexpensive copying or playing of content purchased legally elsewhere in the world at a lower price in the us the digital millennium copyright act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the enhanced monopoly profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments price discrimination can also be seen where the requirement that goods be identical is relaxed for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination so the profit is equal to the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus the marginal consumer is the one whose reservation price equals the marginal cost of the product the seller produces more of their product than they would to achieve monopoly profits with no price discrimination , which means that there is no deadweight loss in second-degree price discrimination , price varies according to quantity demanded this is a way to differentiate consumers based on preference , and therefore allows the airline to capture more consumer 's surplus third degree price discrimination means charging a different price to different consumer groups ( some of these examples are not pure '' price discrimination '' , in that the differential price is related to production costs : the marginal cost of providing electricity or car parking spaces is very low outside peak hours the two-part tariff is another form of price discrimination where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee for the use of the product this pricing strategy yields a result similar to second-degree price discrimination airlines use several different types of price discrimination , including : bulk discounts to wholesalers , consolidators , and tour operators incentive discounts for higher sales volumes to travel agents and corporate buyers seasonal discounts , incentive discounts , and even general prices that vary by location the price of a flight from say , singapore to beijing can vary widely if one buys the ticket in singapore compared to beijing ( or new york or tokyo or elsewhere ) first degree price discrimination based on customer complete price discrimination is most profitable , and requires the seller to have the most information about buyers right the purpose of price discrimination is generally to capture the market 's consumer surplus this surplus arises because , in a market with a single clearing price , some customers ( the very low price elasticity segment ) would have been prepared to pay more than the single market price in a perfectly-competitive market , manufacturers make normal profit , but not monopoly profit , so they can not engage in price discrimination it can be argued that strictly , a consumer surplus need not exist , for example where fixed costs or economies of scale mean that the marginal cost of adding more consumers is less than the marginal profit from selling more product however , this will cost the consumers as much or more than if they pooled their money to pay a non-discriminating price if the consumer is considered to be the building , then a consumer surplus goes to the inhabitants with price discrimination , ( the bottom diagram ) , the demand curve is divided into two segments ( d1 and d2 ) the firm decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue ( profit maximization ) it is also important to note that the marginal revenue in both markets at the optimal output levels must be equal , otherwise the firm could profit from transferring output over to whichever market is offering higher marginal revenue given that market 1 has a price elasticity of demand of e 1 and market 2 of e 2 , the optimal pricing ration in market 1 versus market 2 is p_1/p_2 1+1/e_2/1+1/e_1 in a market with perfect competition , no price discrimination is possible , and the average total cost ( atc ) curve will be identical to the marginal cost curve ( mc ) the dca 's research on gender pricing in new york city brought national attention to gender-based price discrimination and the financial impact it has on women the ability of pharmaceutical companies to maintain price differences between countries is often either reinforced or hindered by national drugs laws and regulations , or the lack thereof thus airlines use pricing strategies designed to fill seats rather than equate marginal revenue and marginal costs such user-controlled price discrimination exploits similar ability to adapt to varying demand curves or individual price sensitivities , and may avoid the negative perceptions of price discrimination as imposed by a seller price discrimination discussion piece from the filter joelonsoftware 's blog entry on price discrimination taken to the cleaners ? steven

in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount however , product heterogeneity , market frictions or high fixed costs ( which make marginal-cost pricing unsustainable in the long run ) can allow for some degree of differential pricing to different consumers , even in fully competitive retail or industrial markets output can be expanded when price discrimination is very efficient even if output remains constant , price discrimination can reduce efficiency by misallocating output among consumers this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information price discrimination is thus very common in services where resale is not possible ; an example is student discounts at museums : in theory , students , for their condition as students , may get lower prices than the rest of the population for a certain product or service , and later will not become resellers , since what they received , may only be used or consumed by them another example of price discrimination is intellectual property , enforced by law and by technology in the us the digital millennium copyright act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the enhanced monopoly profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production some economists have argued that this is a form of price discrimination exercised by providing a means for consumers to reveal their willingness to pay exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination examples of this might be observed in markets where consumers bid for tenders , though , in this case , the practice of collusive tendering could reduce the market efficiency in second-degree price discrimination , price varies according to quantity demanded additionally to second-degree price discrimination , sellers are not able to differentiate between different types of consumers thus , the suppliers will provide incentives for the consumers to differentiate themselves according to preference , which is done by quantity '' discounts '' , or non-linear pricing this allows the supplier to set different prices to the different groups and capture a larger portion of the total market surplus in reality , different pricing may apply to differences in product quality as well as quantity third degree price discrimination means charging a different price to different consumer groups ( some of these examples are not pure '' price discrimination '' , in that the differential price is related to production costs : the marginal cost of providing electricity or car parking spaces is very low outside peak hours incentivizing consumers to switch to off-peak usage is done as much to minimize costs as to maximize revenue this pricing strategy yields a result similar to second-degree price discrimination this pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right : since the customer has already paid for the initial blade holder and will continue to buy the blades which are cheaper than buying disposable razors both restrictions have the effect of excluding business travelers , who typically travel during the workweek and arrange trips on shorter notice the first/second/third degree taxonomy of price discrimination is due to pigou ( economics of welfare , 4th edition , 1932 ) complete price discrimination is most profitable , and requires the seller to have the most information about buyers right the purpose of price discrimination is generally to capture the market 's consumer surplus this surplus arises because , in a market with a single clearing price , some customers ( the very low price elasticity segment ) would have been prepared to pay more than the single market price in a perfectly-competitive market , manufacturers make normal profit , but not monopoly profit , so they can not engage in price discrimination however , this will cost the consumers as much or more than if they pooled their money to pay a non-discriminating price a higher price ( p1 ) is charged to the low elasticity segment , and a lower price ( p2 ) is charged to the high elasticity segment note that the above requires both first and second degree price discrimination : the right segment corresponds partly to different people than the left segment , partly to the same people , willing to buy more if the product is cheaper as usual , the profit maximizing output ( qt ) is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost curve ( mc ) with the marginal revenue curve for the total market ( mrt ) the firm decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue ( profit maximization ) in a market with perfect competition , no price discrimination is possible , and the average total cost ( atc ) curve will be identical to the marginal cost curve ( mc ) this is often done by assigning capacity to various booking classes , which sell for different prices and which may be linked to fare restrictions 119 , 37-38 however , there is no federal law banning gender-based price discrimination in the sale of products in europe , motor insurance premiums have historically been higher for men than for women , a practice that the insurance industry attempts to justify on the basis of different levels of risk since the purchasing power of african consumers is much lower , sales would be extremely limited without price discrimination this differential pricing enables the nonprofit to serve a broader segment of the market than they could if they only set one price price discrimination discussion piece from the filter joelonsoftware 's blog entry on price discrimination

in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount the effects of price discrimination on social efficiency are unclear even if output remains constant , price discrimination can reduce efficiency by misallocating output among consumers price discrimination requires market segmentation and some means to discourage discount customers from becoming resellers and , by extension , competitors this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information another example of price discrimination is intellectual property , enforced by law and by technology in the market for dvds , laws require dvd players to be designed and produced with hardware or software that prevents inexpensive copying or playing of content purchased legally elsewhere in the world at a lower price in the us the digital millennium copyright act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the enhanced monopoly profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production some economists have argued that this is a form of price discrimination exercised by providing a means for consumers to reveal their willingness to pay exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination so the profit is equal to the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus the marginal consumer is the one whose reservation price equals the marginal cost of the product the seller produces more of their product than they would to achieve monopoly profits with no price discrimination , which means that there is no deadweight loss in second-degree price discrimination , price varies according to quantity demanded additionally to second-degree price discrimination , sellers are not able to differentiate between different types of consumers this is a way to differentiate consumers based on preference , and therefore allows the airline to capture more consumer 's surplus third degree price discrimination means charging a different price to different consumer groups incentivizing consumers to switch to off-peak usage is done as much to minimize costs as to maximize revenue both restrictions have the effect of excluding business travelers , who typically travel during the workweek and arrange trips on shorter notice hotel or car rental firms may quote higher prices to their loyalty program 's top tier members than to the general public complete price discrimination is most profitable , and requires the seller to have the most information about buyers this surplus arises because , in a market with a single clearing price , some customers ( the very low price elasticity segment ) would have been prepared to pay more than the single market price in a perfectly-competitive market , manufacturers make normal profit , but not monopoly profit , so they can not engage in price discrimination it can be argued that strictly , a consumer surplus need not exist , for example where fixed costs or economies of scale mean that the marginal cost of adding more consumers is less than the marginal profit from selling more product however , this will cost the consumers as much or more than if they pooled their money to pay a non-discriminating price with price discrimination , ( the bottom diagram ) , the demand curve is divided into two segments ( d1 and d2 ) the sum of these areas will always be greater than the area without discrimination assuming the demand curve resembles a rectangular hyperbola with unitary elasticity it is very useful for the price discriminator to determine the optimum prices in each market segment as usual , the profit maximizing output ( qt ) is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost curve ( mc ) with the marginal revenue curve for the total market ( mrt ) the firm decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue ( profit maximization ) note that the price in a perfect competition market will always be lower than any price under price discrimination ( including in special cases like the internet connection example above , assuming that the perfectly competitive market allows consumers to pool their resources ) the consumer thus buys the product at the cheapest price at which any manufacturer can produce any quantity price discrimination is a sign that the market is imperfect , the seller has some monopoly power , and that prices and seller profits are higher than they would be in a perfectly competitive market manufacturers may sell their products to similarly situated retailers at different prices based solely on the volume of products purchased airlines and other travel companies use differentiated pricing regularly , as they sell travel products and services simultaneously to different market segments this is often done by assigning capacity to various booking classes , which sell for different prices and which may be linked to fare restrictions the dca 's research on gender pricing in new york city brought national attention to gender-based price discrimination and the financial impact it has on women ( “ affordable care act ” ) , health insurance companies charged women higher premiums for individual health insurance policies than men such user-controlled price discrimination exploits similar ability to adapt to varying demand curves or individual price sensitivities , and may avoid the negative perceptions of price discrimination as imposed by a seller

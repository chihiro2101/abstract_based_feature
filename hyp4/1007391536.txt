in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount the effects of price discrimination on social efficiency are unclear even if output remains constant , price discrimination can reduce efficiency by misallocating output among consumers price discrimination requires market segmentation and some means to discourage discount customers from becoming resellers and , by extension , competitors this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information in the market for dvds , laws require dvd players to be designed and produced with hardware or software that prevents inexpensive copying or playing of content purchased legally elsewhere in the world at a lower price in the us the digital millennium copyright act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the enhanced monopoly profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments price discrimination can also be seen where the requirement that goods be identical is relaxed for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production some economists have argued that this is a form of price discrimination exercised by providing a means for consumers to reveal their willingness to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination the seller produces more of their product than they would to achieve monopoly profits with no price discrimination , which means that there is no deadweight loss examples of this might be observed in markets where consumers bid for tenders , though , in this case , the practice of collusive tendering could reduce the market efficiency in second-degree price discrimination , price varies according to quantity demanded additionally to second-degree price discrimination , sellers are not able to differentiate between different types of consumers thus , the suppliers will provide incentives for the consumers to differentiate themselves according to preference , which is done by quantity '' discounts '' , or non-linear pricing this allows the supplier to set different prices to the different groups and capture a larger portion of the total market surplus in reality , different pricing may apply to differences in product quality as well as quantity third degree price discrimination means charging a different price to different consumer groups ( some of these examples are not pure '' price discrimination '' , in that the differential price is related to production costs : the marginal cost of providing electricity or car parking spaces is very low outside peak hours the two-part tariff is another form of price discrimination where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee for the use of the product this pricing strategy yields a result similar to second-degree price discrimination thus a company may vary pricing by location , but then offer bulk discounts as well first degree price discrimination based on customer the first/second/third degree taxonomy of price discrimination is due to pigou ( economics of welfare , 4th edition , 1932 ) , modern taxonomy of price discrimination right the purpose of price discrimination is generally to capture the market 's consumer surplus price discrimination transfers some of this surplus from the consumer to the producer/marketer in a perfectly-competitive market , manufacturers make normal profit , but not monopoly profit , so they can not engage in price discrimination this means that charging some consumers less than an even share of costs can be beneficial however , this will cost the consumers as much or more than if they pooled their money to pay a non-discriminating price it can be proved mathematically that a firm facing a downward sloping demand curve that is convex to the origin will always obtain higher revenues under price discrimination than under a single price strategy a higher price ( p1 ) is charged to the low elasticity segment , and a lower price ( p2 ) is charged to the high elasticity segment the firm decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue ( profit maximization ) from the demand curve in each market we can determine the profit maximizing prices of p a and & nbsp ; p b given that market 1 has a price elasticity of demand of e 1 and market 2 of e 2 , the optimal pricing ration in market 1 versus market 2 is p_1/p_2 1+1/e_2/1+1/e_1 manufacturers may sell their products to similarly situated retailers at different prices based solely on the volume of products purchased airlines and other travel companies use differentiated pricing regularly , as they sell travel products and services simultaneously to different market segments in the united states , gender-based price discrimination has been a source of debate this differential pricing enables the nonprofit to serve a broader segment of the market than they could if they only set one price price

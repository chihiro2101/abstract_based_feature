in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount however , product heterogeneity , market frictions or high fixed costs ( which make marginal-cost pricing unsustainable in the long run ) can allow for some degree of differential pricing to different consumers , even in fully competitive retail or industrial markets even if output remains constant , price discrimination can reduce efficiency by misallocating output among consumers this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information the boundary set up by the marketer to keep segments separate is referred to as a rate fence in the us the digital millennium copyright act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the enhanced monopoly profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments price discrimination can also be seen where the requirement that goods be identical is relaxed for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production some economists have argued that this is a form of price discrimination exercised by providing a means for consumers to reveal their willingness to pay exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination the marginal consumer is the one whose reservation price equals the marginal cost of the product the seller produces more of their product than they would to achieve monopoly profits with no price discrimination , which means that there is no deadweight loss examples of this might be observed in markets where consumers bid for tenders , though , in this case , the practice of collusive tendering could reduce the market efficiency this allows the supplier to set different prices to the different groups and capture a larger portion of the total market surplus in reality , different pricing may apply to differences in product quality as well as quantity some parking lots charge less for '' early bird '' customers who arrive at the parking lot before a certain time the two-part tariff is another form of price discrimination where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee for the use of the product this pricing strategy yields a result similar to second-degree price discrimination this pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right : since the customer has already paid for the initial blade holder and will continue to buy the blades which are cheaper than buying disposable razors thus a company may vary pricing by location , but then offer bulk discounts as well indirect segmentation is least profitable , and requires the seller to have the least information about buyers right the purpose of price discrimination is generally to capture the market 's consumer surplus this surplus arises because , in a market with a single clearing price , some customers ( the very low price elasticity segment ) would have been prepared to pay more than the single market price this means that charging some consumers less than an even share of costs can be beneficial it can be proved mathematically that a firm facing a downward sloping demand curve that is convex to the origin will always obtain higher revenues under price discrimination than under a single price strategy with price discrimination , ( the bottom diagram ) , the demand curve is divided into two segments ( d1 and d2 ) a higher price ( p1 ) is charged to the low elasticity segment , and a lower price ( p2 ) is charged to the high elasticity segment it is very useful for the price discriminator to determine the optimum prices in each market segment as usual , the profit maximizing output ( qt ) is determined by the intersection of the marginal cost curve ( mc ) with the marginal revenue curve for the total market ( mrt ) the firm decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue ( profit maximization ) this output is then divided between the two markets , at the equilibrium marginal revenue level given that market 1 has a price elasticity of demand of e 1 and market 2 of e 2 , the optimal pricing ration in market 1 versus market 2 is p_1/p_2 1+1/e_2/1+1/e_1 in a market with perfect competition , no price discrimination is possible , and the average total cost ( atc ) curve will be identical to the marginal cost curve ( mc ) similar techniques are used in pricing business class airline tickets and premium alcoholic drinks , for example the dca 's research on gender pricing in new york city brought national attention to gender-based price discrimination and the financial impact it has on women since the purchasing power of african consumers is much lower , sales would be extremely limited without price discrimination some academic software may have differing licenses than retail versions , usually disallowing their use in activities for profit or expiring the license after a given number of months thus the clients paying a higher price at the top of the fee scale help subsidize the clients at the bottom of the scale while the conventional theory of price discrimination generally assumes that prices are set by the seller , there is a variant form in which prices are set by the buyer , such as in the form of pay what you want pricing price discrimination discussion piece from the filter joelonsoftware 's

in a theoretical market with perfect information , substitute good , and no transaction costs or prohibition on secondary exchange ( or re-selling ) to prevent arbitrage , price discrimination can only be a feature of monopoly and oligopoly markets , ( '' price discrimination and imperfect competition '' , lars a otherwise , the moment the seller tries to sell the same good at different prices , the buyer at the lower price can arbitrage by selling to the consumer buying at the higher price but with a tiny discount even if output remains constant , price discrimination can reduce efficiency by misallocating output among consumers price discrimination requires market segmentation and some means to discourage discount customers from becoming resellers and , by extension , competitors this usually entails using one or more means of preventing any resale : keeping the different price groups separate , making price comparisons difficult , or restricting pricing information another example of price discrimination is intellectual property , enforced by law and by technology in the us the digital millennium copyright act has provisions to outlaw circumventing of such devices to protect the enhanced monopoly profits that copyright holders can obtain from price discrimination against higher price market segments price discrimination can also be seen where the requirement that goods be identical is relaxed for example , so-called '' premium products '' ( including relatively simple products , such as cappuccino compared to regular coffee with cream have a price differential that is not explained by the cost of production some economists have argued that this is a form of price discrimination exercised by providing a means for consumers to reveal their willingness to pay exercising first degree ( or perfect or primary ) price discrimination requires the monopoly seller of a good or service to know the absolute maximum price ( or reservation price ) that every consumer is willing to pay by knowing the reservation price , the seller is able to sell the good or service to each consumer at the maximum price they are willing to pay , and thus transform the consumer surplus into revenues , leading it to be the most profitable form of price discrimination in second-degree price discrimination , price varies according to quantity demanded larger quantities are available at a lower unit price this is particularly widespread in sales to industrial customers , where bulk buyers enjoy discounts thus , the suppliers will provide incentives for the consumers to differentiate themselves according to preference , which is done by quantity '' discounts '' , or non-linear pricing this allows the supplier to set different prices to the different groups and capture a larger portion of the total market surplus in reality , different pricing may apply to differences in product quality as well as quantity third degree price discrimination means charging a different price to different consumer groups the two-part tariff is another form of price discrimination where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee for the use of the product this pricing strategy yields a result similar to second-degree price discrimination both restrictions have the effect of excluding business travelers , who typically travel during the workweek and arrange trips on shorter notice first degree price discrimination based on customer the first/second/third degree taxonomy of price discrimination is due to pigou ( economics of welfare , 4th edition , 1932 ) , modern taxonomy of price discrimination indirect segmentation is least profitable , and requires the seller to have the least information about buyers it can be argued that strictly , a consumer surplus need not exist , for example where fixed costs or economies of scale mean that the marginal cost of adding more consumers is less than the marginal profit from selling more product it can be proved mathematically that a firm facing a downward sloping demand curve that is convex to the origin will always obtain higher revenues under price discrimination than under a single price strategy the amount of revenue is represented by area p , a , q , o with price discrimination , ( the bottom diagram ) , the demand curve is divided into two segments ( d1 and d2 ) a higher price ( p1 ) is charged to the low elasticity segment , and a lower price ( p2 ) is charged to the high elasticity segment note that the above requires both first and second degree price discrimination : the right segment corresponds partly to different people than the left segment , partly to the same people , willing to buy more if the product is cheaper the firm decides what amount of the total output to sell in each market by looking at the intersection of marginal cost with marginal revenue ( profit maximization ) given that market 1 has a price elasticity of demand of e 1 and market 2 of e 2 , the optimal pricing ration in market 1 versus market 2 is p_1/p_2 1+1/e_2/1+1/e_1 note that the price in a perfect competition market will always be lower than any price under price discrimination ( including in special cases like the internet connection example above , assuming that the perfectly competitive market allows consumers to pool their resources ) in a market with perfect competition , no price discrimination is possible , and the average total cost ( atc ) curve will be identical to the marginal cost curve ( mc ) airlines and other travel companies use differentiated pricing regularly , as they sell travel products and services simultaneously to different market segments economists such as tim harford in the undercover economist have argued that this is a form of price discrimination : by providing a choice between a regular and premium product , consumers are being asked to reveal their degree of price sensitivity ( or willingness to pay ) for comparable products in 1992 , the new york city department of consumer affairs ( “ dca ” ) conducted an investigation of “ price bias against women in the marketplace ” in 1995 , california assembly 's office of research studied the issue of gender-based price discrimination of services and estimated that women effectively paid an annual “ gender tax ” of approximately 1,351.00 for the same services as men first the firm must be able to identify market segments by their price elasticity of demand and second the firms must be able to enforce the scheme while the conventional theory of price discrimination generally assumes that prices are set by the seller , there is a variant form in which prices are set by the buyer , such as in the form of pay what you want pricing

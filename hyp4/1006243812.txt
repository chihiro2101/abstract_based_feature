whilst loosely based upon the game of cricket , many aspects are improvised : the playing ground , actual cricket where the stadium is a well-defined entity with proper boundaries , things are a bit different here in the gully equipment and field : the bat can be anything , as long as it can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands they are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing ' this is known as a 'swing ball'—swing balls may be made with : gaffer tape , electrical tape , plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available a completely taped tennis ball is very popular for street cricket in pakistan as the electric tape makes the ball heavier and less bouncy as compared to a normal tennis ball but it is still relatively harmless as compared to a real cricket ball its main purpose is to mark the bowler 's crease , but can be instrumental when there are two batters and one may be run out games with relatively few players typically forgo the teams and innings format of professional cricket , opting instead for a batsmen-vs-everyone format gully cricket rules are often fixed by the players playing it however a list of the typical rules which are used most of the time are as follows : no ducks – a batsman can not be given out without scoring – they always get another go until they 've scored 1+ runs first/trial ball rule : ( a stricter alternative to no ducks ) a batter can not be given out on the first ball they face ( known as trial ball in the subcontinent ) no lbw – as many backyard cricket games are without umpires , or self-umpired , or played with juniors , teams may agree to not use the relatively difficult lbw rule three hits on the body can get the batter out in gully cricket , '' a batsman is out if he touches the ball with his body three times in total or two times in a row six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds ; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out , even if no damage is evident if a dog catches the ball ( the one-bounce rule is also often allowed ) , or if the dog ( or any other pet ) is hit by the ball on-the-full , the batsman is declared out if the batsman is outside his crease when the bowler/fielder collects the ball while standing on the stumps , he will be declared run out he is allowed to bat at any order , but depending on two captain agreement he can be restricted to bat last , which is after all team player gets out if the game is not played individually , a person who owns bat and ball and claim to bat and ball first , because he is the boss for owning bat and ball gilli-danda lawn game stickball tape ball cricket wiffleball french cricket

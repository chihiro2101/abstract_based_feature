whilst loosely based upon the game of cricket , many aspects are improvised : the playing ground , actual cricket where the stadium is a well-defined entity with proper boundaries , things are a bit different here in the gully there is no specified playing area in gully cricket equipment and field : the bat can be anything , as long as it can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands tennis balls are often used due to the fact that they are less likely to inflict injuries than a cricket ball they are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness tennis balls also bounce more than normal cricket balls , especially at low speeds often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing ' this is known as a 'swing ball'—swing balls may be made with : gaffer tape , electrical tape , plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available a completely taped tennis ball is very popular for street cricket in pakistan as the electric tape makes the ball heavier and less bouncy as compared to a normal tennis ball but it is still relatively harmless as compared to a real cricket ball the wicket may be any convenient object – a chair , a cardboard box , a set of long twigs or sticks , a rubbish bin , tree or a drawing on the wall a wicket at the non-striker 's end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe garden/backyard cricket in south africa and australia is considered by many to be the pinnacle event of social and sporting excellence in the summer period gully cricket rules are often fixed by the players playing it backyard cricket allows for rules to be changed , and the rules being played by will depend on the context and physical environment of the game running to score runs hit and run — ( also known as tip and run ) like in baseball , if the batsman 's bat makes contact with the ball they must run if a dog catches the ball ( the one-bounce rule is also often allowed ) , or if the dog ( or any other pet ) is hit by the ball on-the-full , the batsman is declared out if the game is not played individually , a person who owns bat and ball and claim to bat and ball first , because he is the boss for owning bat and ball during low tide , the pitch tends to be on the semi-wet sand , and is deemed superior than cricket played in high tide ( when the pitch is on dryer , looser sand ) gilli-danda lawn game stickball tape ball cricket wiffleball french cricket

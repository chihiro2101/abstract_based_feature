whilst loosely based upon the game of cricket , many aspects are improvised : the playing ground , actual cricket where the stadium is a well-defined entity with proper boundaries , things are a bit different here in the gully there is no specified playing area in gully cricket unlike cricket stadiums where they have a limitless sky to their benefit , here in gully taking the aerial route may not be a viable option due to the presence of terraces and balconies tennis balls are often used due to the fact that they are less likely to inflict injuries than a cricket ball they are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing ' this is known as a 'swing ball'—swing balls may be made with : gaffer tape , electrical tape , plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available a completely taped tennis ball is very popular for street cricket in pakistan as the electric tape makes the ball heavier and less bouncy as compared to a normal tennis ball but it is still relatively harmless as compared to a real cricket ball the wicket may be any convenient object – a chair , a cardboard box , a set of long twigs or sticks , a rubbish bin , tree or a drawing on the wall garden/backyard cricket in south africa and australia is considered by many to be the pinnacle event of social and sporting excellence in the summer period several closely related variants of cricket exist in south america , known as bete-ombro , taco , bets , or plaquita backyard cricket allows for rules to be changed , and the rules being played by will depend on the context and physical environment of the game first/trial ball rule : ( a stricter alternative to no ducks ) a batter can not be given out on the first ball they face ( known as trial ball in the subcontinent ) pitch – the pitch should be between 11 and 33 yards ( 10 to 30 metres ) , with limiting factors such as backyard size often dictating the length ways of getting out one hand , one bounce – if the batsman has hit the ball into the ground , but it has only bounced once , they can still be given out caught , but only if the fielder catches the ball with one hand ; even if the hand hits the ground ( keeping in mind dust on back of palm ) the player is out three hits on the body can get the batter out in gully cricket , '' a batsman is out if he touches the ball with his body three times in total or two times in a row play on an actual beach can be achieved either by using the flat strip of hard-packed sand along the surf line as the pitch , or by only '' bowling '' gentle full tosses to avoid the problem of the ball not bouncing off loose sand the tide plays a big part in the standard of the pitch in beach cricket gilli-danda lawn game stickball tape ball cricket wiffleball french cricket

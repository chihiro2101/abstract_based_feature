several rulers of antiquity dreamed of digging a cutting through the isthmus the first to propose such an undertaking was the tyrant periander in the 7th century bc the project was abandoned and periander instead constructed a simpler and less costly overland portage road , named the diolkos or stone carriageway , along which ships could be towed from one side of the isthmus to the other a selection of papers from the first international early railways conference ( 2001 ) , pp werner , walter : '' the largest ship trackway in ancient times : the diolkos of the isthmus of corinth , greece , and early attempts to build a canal '' , the international journal of nautical archaeology , vol 98–119 remnants of the diolkos still exist next to the modern canal gerster , béla , '' l'isthme de corinthe : tentatives de percement dans l'antiquité '' , bulletin de correspondance hellénique ( 1884 ) , vol 225–232 ( in french ) the philosopher apollonius of tyana prophesied that anyone who proposed to dig a corinthian canal would be met with illness three roman rulers considered the idea but all suffered violent deaths ; the historians plutarch and suetonius both wrote that the roman dictator julius caesar considered digging a canal through the isthmus but was assassinated before he could begin the project suetonius , '' lives of the caesars : julius caesar '' , 44.3 caligula , the third roman emperor , commissioned a study in 40 & nbsp ; ad from egyptian experts who claimed incorrectly that the corinthian gulf was higher than the saronic gulf the roman workforce , consisting of 6,000 first jewish–roman war , started digging trenches from both sides , while a third group at the ridge drilled deep shafts for probing the quality of the rock ( which were reused in 1881 for the same purpose ) the idea of a canal was revived after greece greek war of independence from the ottoman empire in 1830 fresh impetus was given by the opening of the suez canal in 1869 and the following year , the government of prime minister thrasyvoulos zaimis passed a law authorizing the construction of a corinth canal french entrepreneurs were put in charge but , following the bankruptcy of the french company that had attempted to dig the panama canal , french banks refused to lend money and the company went bankrupt as well this required further expense in building retaining walls along the water 's edge for more than half of the length of the canal , using 165,000 cubic metres of masonry the canal consists of a single channel deep , excavated at sea level ( thus requiring no locks ) , measuring long by wide at sea level and wide at the bottom the canal is currently used mainly by tourist ships ; around 11,000 ships per year travel through the waterway

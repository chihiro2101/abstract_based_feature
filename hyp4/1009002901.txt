the romans referred to tongeren as aduatuca tungrorum or atuatuca tongrorum , and it was the capital of the large roman province of civitas tungrorum , an area which covered modern belgian limburg , and at least parts of all the areas around it before the roman conquests , this area was inhabited by the group of belgic tribes known as the germani cisrhenani ( despite being known as the germani , whether they spoke a germanic language is debated , and the names of their tribes and their leaders were celts ) specifically the eburones were the largest of these tribes and the one living around tongeren caesar referred to the fort of the eburones as aduatuca , and this has led to a widely accepted proposal that this can be equated to tongeren there are counter arguments that the word '' aduatuca '' was probably a general word for a fort in this region , meaning that there might have been more places with the same name , and that tongeren shows no signs of pre-roman occupation , nor the hilly terrain described by caesar during julius caesar â€™ s campaigns in this part of gaul in the first century bc , the belgae revolted against the campaign of caesar , led by the eburones the tungri , not mentioned by caesar , came to dominate this area in the roman era , and are the reason for the name of the modern name tongeren but many modern writers believe that the gallo-roman population of the area contained a significant amount of more recent germanic immigrants from across the rhine located on the important road linking cologne to bavay via the relay of liberchies , and surrounded by the fertile lands of the hesbaye region , roman tongeren quickly became one of the largest gallo-roman administrative and military towns in the first century it suffered from a destructive fire during the batavian siege in 70 ad , which was part of the batavian revolt in 358 the future emperor julian met , in tongeren , a delegation of salian franks who had recently settled in toxandria ( the modern campine region ) , to the north of tongeren already in the fourth century , just as the salian franks were settling to the north , the city became the center of a christian diocese under the influence of saint servatius , bishop of tongeren , who died in 384 ad tongeren is currently the judicial capital of the province of belgian limburg the tongeren basilica ( onze-lieve-vrouwe basiliek ) , built in gothic style in the thirteenth century , where recent excavations have produced some of the richest archaeological finds in flanders official website - only available in dutch roman tongeren gallo-roman museum tongeren travel guide & nbsp ; - a comprehensive english language guide to tongeren ; includes history , sightseeing , brewing and beer culture .

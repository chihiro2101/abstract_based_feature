le verrier was born at saint-lô , manche , france , in a modest bourgeois family , his parents being , louis-baptiste le verrier and marie-jeanne-josephine-pauline de baudre , and studied at école polytechnique in 1846 , le verrier became a member of the french academy of sciences , and in 1855 , he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences le verrier 's most famous achievement is his prediction of the existence of the then unknown planet neptune , using only mathematics and astronomical observations of the known planet uranus encouraged by physicist arago , arago summary director of the paris observatory , le verrier was intensely engaged for months in complex calculations to explain small but systematic discrepancies between uranus 's observed orbit and the one predicted from the laws of gravity of newton at the same time , but unknown to le verrier , similar calculations were made by john couch adams in england le verrier transmitted his own prediction by 18 september in a letter to johann galle of the berlin observatory the letter arrived five days later , and the planet was found with the berlin fraunhofer refractor that same evening , 23 september 1846 , by galle and heinrich d'arrest within 1° of the predicted location near the boundary between capricorn and aquarius there is no ambiguity to the discovery claims of le verrier , galle , and d'arrest adams made full public acknowledgement of le verrier 's priority and credit ( not forgetting to mention the role of galle ) when he gave his paper to the royal astronomical society in november 1846 : in 1859 , le verrier was the first to report that the slow precession of mercury ’ s orbit around the sun could not be completely explained by newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets ) the success of the search for neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of uranus led astronomers to place some faith in this possible explanation , and the hypothetical planet was even named vulcan

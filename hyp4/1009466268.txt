alfred thayer mahan and sea power alfred thayer mahan ( 1840–1914 ) was a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the eurasian context , namely , the central zone of asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from asia minor to japan alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 26-27 ) of the two monsters – britain and russia – it was the latter that mahan considered more threatening to the fate of central asia alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) lea believed that while japan moved against far east and russia against india , the germans would strike at england , the center of the british empire two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the cold war , writing books on the subject in the 1990s—diplomacy and the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives the anglo-american classical geopolitical theories were revived '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions '' therefore , the united states must '' maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism 814 after russia , the second geopolitical threat which remained was germany and , as mackinder had feared ninety years ago , its partnership with russia during the cold war , kissinger argues , both sides of the atlantic recognized that , '' unless america is organically involved in europe , it would later be obliged to involve itself under circumstances which would be far less favorable to both sides of the atlantic thus kissinger believed that no country 's interests would ever be served if germany and russia were to ever form a partnership in which each country would consider itself the principal partner 821-2 spykman 's vision of eurasia was strongly confirmed : '' geopolitically , america is an island off the shores of the large landmass of eurasia , whose resources and population far exceed those of the united states the domination by a single power of either of eurasia 's two principal spheres—europe and asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for america that danger would have to be resisted even if the dominant power was apparently benevolent , for if its intentions ever changed , america would find itself with a grossly diminished capacity for effective resistance and a growing inability to shape events now , however , he focused on the beginning of the cold war : '' the objective of moral opposition to communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing soviet expansion '' in classical spykman terms , brzezinski formulated his geostrategic '' chessboard '' doctrine of eurasia , which aims to prevent the unification of this mega-continent the austro-hungarian historian emil reich ( 1854–1910 ) is considered to be the first having coined the term in english as early as 1902 and later published in england in 1904 in his book foundations of modern europe sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers those scholars who look to mackinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for britain with his eurocentric analysis of historical geography his formulation of the heartland theory was set out in his article entitled '' the geographical pivot of history '' , published in england in 1904 the basic notions of mackinder 's doctrine involve considering the geography of the earth as being divided into two sections : the afro-eurasia or core , comprising eurasia and africa ; and the peripheral '' islands '' , including the americas , australia , japan , the british isles , and oceania the world island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn , and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the periphery ( so they would have a longer struggle reaching them , and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion ) under spykman 's theory , a rimland separates the heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year ( that is , not frozen up during winter ) policy on preventing the spread of soviet influence after world war ii ( see also truman doctrine ) the geopolitical theory of ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping , and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic classical geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for military history as well as for sub-disciplines of political science such as international relations and security studies france geographer and geopolitician jacques ancel is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in france , and gave a notable series of lectures at the european center of the carnegie endowment for international peace in paris and published géopolitique in 1936 connected with this stream , and former member of hérodote editorial board , the french geographer michel foucher developed a long term analysis of international borders the thought of this school is expressed through the french review of geopolitics ( headed by chauprade ) and the international academy of geopolitics vladimir karyakin , leading researcher at the russian institute for strategic studies , has proposed the term '' geopolitics of the third wave ''

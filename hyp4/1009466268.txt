alfred thayer mahan and sea power alfred thayer mahan ( 1840–1914 ) was a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war mahan 's theoretical framework came from antoine-henri jomini , and emphasized that strategic locations ( such as choke points , canals , and coaling stations ) , as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet , were conducive to control over the sea he proposed six conditions required for a nation to have sea power : advantageous geographical position ; serviceable coastlines , abundant natural resources , and favorable climate ; extent of territory population large enough to defend its territory ; society with an aptitude for the sea and commercial enterprise ; and government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the eurasian context , namely , the central zone of asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from asia minor to japan alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 26-27 ) of the two monsters – britain and russia – it was the latter that mahan considered more threatening to the fate of central asia alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the cold war , writing books on the subject in the 1990s—diplomacy and the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions '' therefore , the united states must '' maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism 814 after russia , the second geopolitical threat which remained was germany and , as mackinder had feared ninety years ago , its partnership with russia without america , britain and france can not cope with germany and russia ; and '' without europe , america could turn … into an island off the shores of eurasia 821-2 spykman 's vision of eurasia was strongly confirmed : '' geopolitically , america is an island off the shores of the large landmass of eurasia , whose resources and population far exceed those of the united states for such a grouping would have the capacity to outstrip america economically and , in the end , militarily that danger would have to be resisted even if the dominant power was apparently benevolent , for if its intentions ever changed , america would find itself with a grossly diminished capacity for effective resistance and a growing inability to shape events now , however , he focused on the beginning of the cold war : '' the objective of moral opposition to communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing soviet expansion 703-732 three years after kissinger 's diplomacy , zbigniew brzezinski followed suit , launching the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives and , after three more years , the geostrategic triad : living with china , europe , and russia the grand chessboard described the american triumph in the cold war in terms of control over eurasia : for the first time ever , a '' non-eurasian '' power had emerged as a key arbiter of '' eurasian '' power relations the book states its purpose : '' the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book '' although the power configuration underwent a revolutionary change , brzezinski confirmed three years later , eurasia was still a mega-continent but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges , capable of dominating eurasia and thus also of challenging america… for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia…and america 's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers those scholars who look to mackinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for britain with his eurocentric analysis of historical geography his formulation of the heartland theory was set out in his article entitled '' the geographical pivot of history '' , published in england in 1904 the basic notions of mackinder 's doctrine involve considering the geography of the earth as being divided into two sections : the afro-eurasia or core , comprising eurasia and africa ; and the peripheral '' islands '' , including the americas , australia , japan , the british isles , and oceania not only was the periphery noticeably smaller than the world island , it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the world island—which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy the world island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn , and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the periphery ( so they would have a longer struggle reaching them , and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion ) in 1923 , karl haushofer founded the zeitschrift für geopolitik ( journal for geopolitics ) , which was later used in the propaganda of nazi germany national socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities , in the form of a hypothesized 'racial character , ' to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society while rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the german and anglo-american traditions ( and the new geographers ) , this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis thual , aymeric chauprade , former professor of geopolitics at the french war college and now member of the extreme-right party '' front national '' , subscribes to a supposed '' new '' french school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to realpolitik and '' clash of civilization '' ( huntington ) vladimir karyakin , leading researcher at the russian institute for strategic studies , has proposed the term '' geopolitics of the third wave ''

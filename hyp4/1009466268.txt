alfred thayer mahan ( 1840–1914 ) was a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 26-27 ) in this zone independent countries still survived – turkey , persia , afghanistan , china , and japan of the two monsters – britain and russia – it was the latter that mahan considered more threatening to the fate of central asia therefore , he found it necessary for the anglo-saxon '' sea power '' to resist russia alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) homer lea , in the day of the saxon ( 1912 ) , asserted that the entire anglo-saxon race faced a threat from german ( teuton ) , russian ( slav ) , and japanese expansionism : the '' fatal '' relationship of russia , japan , and germany '' has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of saxon supremacy two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the cold war , writing books on the subject in the 1990s—diplomacy and the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions '' therefore , the united states must '' maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism during the cold war , kissinger argues , both sides of the atlantic recognized that , '' unless america is organically involved in europe , it would later be obliged to involve itself under circumstances which would be far less favorable to both sides of the atlantic germany has become so strong that existing european institutions can not strike a balance between germany and its european partners all by themselves thus kissinger believed that no country 's interests would ever be served if germany and russia were to ever form a partnership in which each country would consider itself the principal partner 821-2 spykman 's vision of eurasia was strongly confirmed : '' geopolitically , america is an island off the shores of the large landmass of eurasia , whose resources and population far exceed those of the united states the domination by a single power of either of eurasia 's two principal spheres—europe and asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for america 810 having converted from an ideologist into a geopolitician , kissinger retrospectively interpreted the cold war in geopolitical terms—an approach which was not characteristic of his works during the cold war the book states its purpose : '' the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book '' although the power configuration underwent a revolutionary change , brzezinski confirmed three years later , eurasia was still a mega-continent '' in classical spykman terms , brzezinski formulated his geostrategic '' chessboard '' doctrine of eurasia , which aims to prevent the unification of this mega-continent but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges , capable of dominating eurasia and thus also of challenging america… for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia…and america 's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained the austro-hungarian historian emil reich ( 1854–1910 ) is considered to be the first having coined the term in english as early as 1902 and later published in england in 1904 in his book foundations of modern europe sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers his formulation of the heartland theory was set out in his article entitled '' the geographical pivot of history '' , published in england in 1904 the heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the heartland—which would n't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent the basic notions of mackinder 's doctrine involve considering the geography of the earth as being divided into two sections : the afro-eurasia or core , comprising eurasia and africa ; and the peripheral '' islands '' , including the americas , australia , japan , the british isles , and oceania not only was the periphery noticeably smaller than the world island , it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the world island—which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy policy on preventing the spread of soviet influence after world war ii ( see also truman doctrine ) ratzel published several papers , among which was the essay '' lebensraum '' ( 1901 ) concerning biogeography in 1923 , karl haushofer founded the zeitschrift für geopolitik ( journal for geopolitics ) , which was later used in the propaganda of nazi germany this has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography , and proponents of a '' neo '' -classical geopolitics in particular france geographer and geopolitician jacques ancel is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in france , and gave a notable series of lectures at the european center of the carnegie endowment for international peace in paris and published géopolitique in 1936 the thought of this school is expressed through the french review of geopolitics ( headed by chauprade ) and the international academy of geopolitics vladimir karyakin , leading researcher at the russian institute for strategic studies , has proposed the term '' geopolitics of the third wave ''

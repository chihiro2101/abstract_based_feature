alfred thayer mahan and sea power alfred thayer mahan ( 1840–1914 ) was a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war mahan 's theoretical framework came from antoine-henri jomini , and emphasized that strategic locations ( such as choke points , canals , and coaling stations ) , as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet , were conducive to control over the sea mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the eurasian context , namely , the central zone of asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from asia minor to japan alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 26-27 ) of the two monsters – britain and russia – it was the latter that mahan considered more threatening to the fate of central asia alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) homer lea , in the day of the saxon ( 1912 ) , asserted that the entire anglo-saxon race faced a threat from german ( teuton ) , russian ( slav ) , and japanese expansionism : the '' fatal '' relationship of russia , japan , and germany '' has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of saxon supremacy lea believed that while japan moved against far east and russia against india , the germans would strike at england , the center of the british empire two famous security advisors from the cold war period , henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski , argued to continue the united states geopolitical focus on eurasia and , particularly on russia , despite the fall of communism and the end of the cold war kissinger argued against the belief that with the dissolution of the ussr , hostile intentions had come to an end and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer applied '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions '' therefore , the united states must '' maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism 814 after russia , the second geopolitical threat which remained was germany and , as mackinder had feared ninety years ago , its partnership with russia during the cold war , kissinger argues , both sides of the atlantic recognized that , '' unless america is organically involved in europe , it would later be obliged to involve itself under circumstances which would be far less favorable to both sides of the atlantic thus kissinger believed that no country 's interests would ever be served if germany and russia were to ever form a partnership in which each country would consider itself the principal partner without america , britain and france can not cope with germany and russia ; and '' without europe , america could turn … into an island off the shores of eurasia the domination by a single power of either of eurasia 's two principal spheres—europe and asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for america 810 having converted from an ideologist into a geopolitician , kissinger retrospectively interpreted the cold war in geopolitical terms—an approach which was not characteristic of his works during the cold war the grand chessboard described the american triumph in the cold war in terms of control over eurasia : for the first time ever , a '' non-eurasian '' power had emerged as a key arbiter of '' eurasian '' power relations '' although the power configuration underwent a revolutionary change , brzezinski confirmed three years later , eurasia was still a mega-continent the austro-hungarian historian emil reich ( 1854–1910 ) is considered to be the first having coined the term in english as early as 1902 and later published in england in 1904 in his book foundations of modern europe sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers he saw navy as a basis of colombian era empire ( roughly from 1492 to the 19th century ) , and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power the heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the heartland—which would n't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent the basic notions of mackinder 's doctrine involve considering the geography of the earth as being divided into two sections : the afro-eurasia or core , comprising eurasia and africa ; and the peripheral '' islands '' , including the americas , australia , japan , the british isles , and oceania the world island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn , and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the periphery ( so they would have a longer struggle reaching them , and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion ) spykman modified mackinder 's formula on the relationship between the heartland and the rimland ( or the inner crescent ) , claiming that '' who controls the rimland rules eurasia the geopolitical theory of ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping , and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic nevertheless , german geopolitik was discredited by its ( mis ) use in nazi expansionist policy of world war ii and has never achieved standing comparable to the pre-war period this book—which is very famous in france—symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics ( if not so far the first french school of geopolitics as ancel was very isolated in the 1930s–40s ) thual , aymeric chauprade , former professor of geopolitics at the french war college and now member of the extreme-right party '' front national '' , subscribes to a supposed '' new '' french school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to realpolitik and '' clash of civilization '' ( huntington ) the thought of this school is expressed through the french review of geopolitics ( headed by chauprade ) and the international academy of geopolitics nitze school of advanced international studies school of international and public affairs at columbia university woodrow wilson school of public and international affairs university of cambridge university of oxford graduate institute of international and development studies soas , university of london

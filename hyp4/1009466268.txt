alfred thayer mahan ( 1840–1914 ) was a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs mahan believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the eurasian context , namely , the central zone of asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from asia minor to japan alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 26-27 ) of the two monsters – britain and russia – it was the latter that mahan considered more threatening to the fate of central asia mahan was impressed by russia 's transcontinental size and strategically favorable position for southward expansion alfred thayer mahan , the problem of asia and the effects upon international politics , ( washington and london : kennikat press , 1920 , p 25-27 , 167-8 , 172 ) lea believed that while japan moved against far east and russia against india , the germans would strike at england , the center of the british empire both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the cold war , writing books on the subject in the 1990s—diplomacy and the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives the anglo-american classical geopolitical theories were revived '' they would argue … that russia , regardless of who governs it , sits astride the territory which halford mackinder called the geopolitical heartland , and it is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions thus kissinger believed that no country 's interests would ever be served if germany and russia were to ever form a partnership in which each country would consider itself the principal partner the domination by a single power of either of eurasia 's two principal spheres—europe and asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for america 813 the main interest of the american leaders is maintaining the balance of power in eurasia kissinger , henry , ( 1994 ) 810 having converted from an ideologist into a geopolitician , kissinger retrospectively interpreted the cold war in geopolitical terms—an approach which was not characteristic of his works during the cold war 804 nixon , he added , was a geopolitical rather than an ideological cold warrior 703-732 three years after kissinger 's diplomacy , zbigniew brzezinski followed suit , launching the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives and , after three more years , the geostrategic triad : living with china , europe , and russia the grand chessboard described the american triumph in the cold war in terms of control over eurasia : for the first time ever , a '' non-eurasian '' power had emerged as a key arbiter of '' eurasian '' power relations like spykman , brzezinski acknowledges that : '' cumulatively , eurasia 's power vastly overshadows america 's sir halford mackinder 's heartland theory initially received little attention outside the world of geography , but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the foreign policy of world powers his formulation of the heartland theory was set out in his article entitled '' the geographical pivot of history '' , published in england in 1904 mackinder 's doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of alfred thayer mahan about the significance of navies ( he coined the term sea power ) in world conflict the heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the heartland—which would n't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent mackinder posited that the industrial centers of the periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations mackinder called this region the heartland the heartland contained the grain reserves of ukraine , and many other natural resources his work was based on assumptions similar to mackinder 's , including the unity of world politics and the world sea under spykman 's theory , a rimland separates the heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year ( that is , not frozen up during winter ) spykman suggested this required that attempts by heartland nations ( particularly russia ) to conquer ports in the rimland must be prevented spykman modified mackinder 's formula on the relationship between the heartland and the rimland ( or the inner crescent ) , claiming that '' who controls the rimland rules eurasia this has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography , and proponents of a '' neo '' -classical geopolitics in particular this approach emphasizes the importance of multi-level ( or multi-scales ) analysis and maps at the opposite of critical geopolitics which avoid such tools connected with this stream , and former member of hérodote editorial board , the french geographer michel foucher developed a long term analysis of international borders the thought of this school is expressed through the french review of geopolitics ( headed by chauprade ) and the international academy of geopolitics its publication in 1997 was well received in russia and powerful russian political figures subsequently took an interest in dugin

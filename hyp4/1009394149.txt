left just as software engineering ( as a process ) is defined by differing methodologies , so the programming languages ( as models of computation ) are defined by differing paradigms software designers and programmers decide how to use those paradigm elements in object-oriented programming , programs are treated as a set of interacting objects when programming computers or systems with many processors , in process-oriented programming , programs are treated as sets of concurrent processes that act on a logical shared data structures programming paradigms can also be compared with programming models , which allows invoking an execution model by using only an api programming models can also be classified into paradigms based on features of the execution model for parallel computing , using a programming model instead of a language is common these can be considered flavors of programming paradigm that apply to only parallel languages and programming models some programming language researchers criticise the notion of paradigms as a classification of programming languages , e.g . they argue that many programming languages can not be strictly classified into one paradigm , but rather include features from several paradigms an archetype of a declarative language is the fourth generation language sql , and the family of functional languages and logic programming programs written using this paradigm use functions , blocks of code intended to behave like function ( mathematics ) most programming languages support more than one programming paradigm to allow programmers to use the most suitable programming style and associated language constructs for a given job .

left just as software engineering ( as a process ) is defined by differing methodologies , so the programming languages ( as models of computation ) are defined by differing paradigms when programming computers or systems with many processors , in process-oriented programming , programs are treated as sets of concurrent processes that act on a logical shared data structures for instance , pure functional programming disallows use of side-effects , while structured programming disallows use of the goto statement programming paradigms can also be compared with programming models , which allows invoking an execution model by using only an api programming models can also be classified into paradigms based on features of the execution model for parallel computing , using a programming model instead of a language is common thus , it is more convenient to use a base sequential language and insert api calls to parallel execution models via a programming model these can be considered flavors of programming paradigm that apply to only parallel languages and programming models . they argue that many programming languages can not be strictly classified into one paradigm , but rather include features from several paradigms following the widespread use of procedural languages , object-oriented programming ( oop ) languages were created , such as simula , smalltalk , c++ , c , eiffel , php , and java because object-oriented programming is considered a paradigm , not a language , it is possible to create even an object-oriented assembler language an archetype of a declarative language is the fourth generation language sql , and the family of functional languages and logic programming most programming languages support more than one programming paradigm to allow programmers to use the most suitable programming style and associated language constructs for a given job .

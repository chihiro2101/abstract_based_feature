left just as software engineering ( as a process ) is defined by differing methodologies , so the programming languages ( as models of computation ) are defined by differing paradigms for example , programs written in c++ , object pascal or php can be purely procedural , purely object-oriented , or can contain elements of both or other paradigms in object-oriented programming , programs are treated as a set of interacting objects in functional programming , programs are treated as a sequence of stateless function evaluations programming paradigms can also be compared with programming models , which allows invoking an execution model by using only an api programming models can also be classified into paradigms based on features of the execution model for parallel computing , using a programming model instead of a language is common as a consequence , no one parallel programming language maps well to all computation problems thus , it is more convenient to use a base sequential language and insert api calls to parallel execution models via a programming model some programming language researchers criticise the notion of paradigms as a classification of programming languages , e.g . they argue that many programming languages can not be strictly classified into one paradigm , but rather include features from several paradigms functional programming is a subset of declarative programming most programming languages support more than one programming paradigm to allow programmers to use the most suitable programming style and associated language constructs for a given job .

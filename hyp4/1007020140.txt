although based on the earlier traditional muixeranga of algemesí in valencia , the tradition of castells within catalonia originated in the ball dels valencians ( valencian dance ) in valls , near the city of tarragona , first documented in 1712 over the course of the 18th century , they spread to other towns and cities in the area , including vilafranca del penedès and tarragona , though it was not until the last 50 years that the practice of building castells began to spread to the rest of catalonia in catalan , the word castell literally translates into castle , however in english its meaning is a human tower a castell is considered a success when assembly and disassembly can be done in complete succession aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower , others are needed to form the pinya , or bottom base of the castell , to sustain its weight members of the pinya ( most often men ) also act as a 'safety net ' if the tower structure collapses , cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels it is not uncommon—when not in competitions—for other colles to assist in the pinya when a small colla is attempting a specially demanding structure in terms of people needed people forming higher levels of the tower move to a position from which they can easily get to their places in the tower this is done slowly and carefully , and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue the upper layers of the tower are built as quickly as possible in order to put minimal strain on the lower castellers , who bear most of the weight of the castell a 'rising ' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air , stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice , skill , and strength bencomo , aida ribot , castells in the construction of a catalan community : body , language , and identity amidst catalonia 's national debate the sash is also believed to support the lower back , and it is used by other castellers in the team as a foothold or handhold when climbing up the tower this tasselled piece of cloth varies in length and width and depends on the casteller 's position inside the tower and also on choice performing castellers usually go barefoot as to minimise injuries upon each other as they climb to their positions and also for sensitivity when balancing and to have better feel and hold each other the arrangement of castellers can be into a multi-tiered structure and the highest has a height spanning of nine or ten people from ground up strength : castellers at the base of the tower are usually stocky , while those further up , though generally lighter and agile , must still be fairly strong balance : supporting those above themselves in the castell , whilst relying on those below for support , requires a strong sense of balance and trust courage : the most important characteristic for castellers , especially for young children forming the highest levels of the castell fatal accidents do occur ; the most recent was on september 15 , 2011 when a man broke his second cervical vertebrae after falling from a castell this led to the requirement of specially designed helmets for all children participating in castells three kinds of base levels are most commonly used : pinya ( '' pine cone/bulk '' ) : the ground-level base , often composed of several hundred people instead , when a tower is built without a pinya , it is described as net ( '' neat '' or '' simple '' ) another aspect of castell nomenclature refers to how successfully the tower was completed in valls , món casteller , the human tower museum of catalonia , is being built human towers world – a site to know more about human towers , types , groups , events or image galleries

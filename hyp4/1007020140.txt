although based on the earlier traditional muixeranga of algemesí in valencia , the tradition of castells within catalonia originated in the ball dels valencians ( valencian dance ) in valls , near the city of tarragona , first documented in 1712 in the 1980s , the inclusion of women in the formerly male-only discipline ushered in the second època d'or ( golden age ) of castells ; the presence of women is credited with allowing castells to be built lighter and stronger , permitting the construction of previously undreamed-of 9- and 10-story castells in 2015 the coordinadora de colles castelleres de catalunya hosted 99 groups , including castellers de vilafranca and minyons de terrassa , who were able to construct the tallest human tower to date , the '' 4 de 10 '' ( 10 levels of people with four in each level ) these icons of catalan culture and sports were featured in the opening ceremonies of the barcelona 1992 summer olympics in catalan , the word castell literally translates into castle , however in english its meaning is a human tower the assembly is complete once all castellers have climbed into their designated places , and the enxaneta climbs into place at the top and raises one open hand the enxaneta then climbs down the other side of the castell , after which the remaining levels of castellers descend in highest to lowest order until all have reached safety aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower , others are needed to form the pinya , or bottom base of the castell , to sustain its weight members of the pinya ( most often men ) also act as a 'safety net ' if the tower structure collapses , cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels it is not uncommon—when not in competitions—for other colles to assist in the pinya when a small colla is attempting a specially demanding structure in terms of people needed people forming higher levels of the tower move to a position from which they can easily get to their places in the tower this is done slowly and carefully , and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue the upper layers of the tower are built as quickly as possible in order to put minimal strain on the lower castellers , who bear most of the weight of the castell the disassembly of the castell , done amidst the cheering of the crowd , is often the most treacherous stage of the event a 'rising ' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air , stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice , skill , and strength bencomo , aida ribot , castells in the construction of a catalan community : body , language , and identity amidst catalonia 's national debate fem pinya ! els castells , símbol i expressió del nostre poble strength : castellers at the base of the tower are usually stocky , while those further up , though generally lighter and agile , must still be fairly strong three kinds of base levels are most commonly used : pinya ( '' pine cone/bulk '' ) : the ground-level base , often composed of several hundred people if nothing else is mentioned , this means that the tower had the bottom base-level pinya ( as always ) and was successfully dismantled ( descarregat ) torre de nou : two people per level in a tower of nine stories cinc de nou amb folre : five people at each level in a tower of nine levels , with a second-level folre built on top of the base-level pinya tres de deu amb folre i manilles : three people per level in a tower of ten levels , with a second-level folre and a third-level manilles cap de colla ( '' team leader '' ) : the head of each team , who decides which castells the team is ready to attempt and directs the construction of the castells from the ground pom de dalt ( '' top group '' ) : the top three levels of the castell : dosos , aixecador , and enxaneta in valls , món casteller , the human tower museum of catalonia , is being built

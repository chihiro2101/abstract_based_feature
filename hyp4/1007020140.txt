although based on the earlier traditional muixeranga of algemesí in valencia , the tradition of castells within catalonia originated in the ball dels valencians ( valencian dance ) in valls , near the city of tarragona , first documented in 1712 in the 1980s , the inclusion of women in the formerly male-only discipline ushered in the second època d'or ( golden age ) of castells ; the presence of women is credited with allowing castells to be built lighter and stronger , permitting the construction of previously undreamed-of 9- and 10-story castells in 2015 the coordinadora de colles castelleres de catalunya hosted 99 groups , including castellers de vilafranca and minyons de terrassa , who were able to construct the tallest human tower to date , the '' 4 de 10 '' ( 10 levels of people with four in each level ) these icons of catalan culture and sports were featured in the opening ceremonies of the barcelona 1992 summer olympics in catalan , the word castell literally translates into castle , however in english its meaning is a human tower the enxaneta then climbs down the other side of the castell , after which the remaining levels of castellers descend in highest to lowest order until all have reached safety aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower , others are needed to form the pinya , or bottom base of the castell , to sustain its weight members of the pinya ( most often men ) also act as a 'safety net ' if the tower structure collapses , cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels it is not uncommon—when not in competitions—for other colles to assist in the pinya when a small colla is attempting a specially demanding structure in terms of people needed first , the pinya— the base of the tower — is formed people forming higher levels of the tower move to a position from which they can easily get to their places in the tower this is done slowly and carefully , and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue then , when the signal to proceed is given , bands begin to play the traditional toc de castells music as a hush comes over spectators of the event a 'rising ' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air , stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice , skill , and strength bencomo , aida ribot , castells in the construction of a catalan community : body , language , and identity amidst catalonia 's national debate this motto is taken from a verse of els xiquets de valls by josep anselm clavé , a catalonian politician and composer strength : castellers at the base of the tower are usually stocky , while those further up , though generally lighter and agile , must still be fairly strong balance : supporting those above themselves in the castell , whilst relying on those below for support , requires a strong sense of balance and trust courage : the most important characteristic for castellers , especially for young children forming the highest levels of the castell castells are primarily described by the number of people in each level of the tronc and the total number of levels and , where applicable , any special construction technique used for example , the levels of a cinc are not pentagons ; instead , the cinc amounts to a tres and a torre fused together ( 3 + 2 5 ) , each level forming a figure-eight shape if seen from above ) very high towers and ones with a small number of people on each level normally need extra support from the base or bottom levels with only a folre and no manilles ) the term amb l'agulla ( '' with the needle '' ) refers to a high column of one person per level which is built inside the main tower torre de nou : two people per level in a tower of nine stories in valls , món casteller , the human tower museum of catalonia , is being built human towers world – a site to know more about human towers , types , groups , events or image galleries

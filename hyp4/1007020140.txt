although based on the earlier traditional muixeranga of algemesí in valencia , the tradition of castells within catalonia originated in the ball dels valencians ( valencian dance ) in valls , near the city of tarragona , first documented in 1712 over the course of the 18th century , they spread to other towns and cities in the area , including vilafranca del penedès and tarragona , though it was not until the last 50 years that the practice of building castells began to spread to the rest of catalonia while in catalonia , the ball dels valencians began to focus more on the acrobatic nature of building ever taller human towers , their more religious and allegorical predecessors retain their traditions : the muixeranga , which is performed in the valencian city of algemesí , and in other places in the valencian land and catalonia , where it is often called the moixiganga in 2015 the coordinadora de colles castelleres de catalunya hosted 99 groups , including castellers de vilafranca and minyons de terrassa , who were able to construct the tallest human tower to date , the '' 4 de 10 '' ( 10 levels of people with four in each level ) in catalan , the word castell literally translates into castle , however in english its meaning is a human tower the assembly is complete once all castellers have climbed into their designated places , and the enxaneta climbs into place at the top and raises one open hand aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower , others are needed to form the pinya , or bottom base of the castell , to sustain its weight members of the pinya ( most often men ) also act as a 'safety net ' if the tower structure collapses , cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels this is done slowly and carefully , and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue the upper layers of the tower are built as quickly as possible in order to put minimal strain on the lower castellers , who bear most of the weight of the castell a 'rising ' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air , stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice , skill , and strength bencomo , aida ribot , castells in the construction of a catalan community : body , language , and identity amidst catalonia 's national debate fem pinya ! els castells , símbol i expressió del nostre poble strength : castellers at the base of the tower are usually stocky , while those further up , though generally lighter and agile , must still be fairly strong courage : the most important characteristic for castellers , especially for young children forming the highest levels of the castell accidents are rare during the construction of a castell ; however , as in every other crowded cultural event , ambulances are stationed nearby in case a person needs immediate attention castells are primarily described by the number of people in each level of the tronc and the total number of levels and , where applicable , any special construction technique used numbers of levels most commonly built : sis : six levels high set : seven levels vuit : eight levels nou : nine levels deu : ten levels for example , a tres de vuit ( abbreviated 3d8 ) denotes a tower with three people per level and eight levels ( in fact , only the first five levels will have three people per level three kinds of base levels are most commonly used : pinya ( '' pine cone/bulk '' ) : the ground-level base , often composed of several hundred people instead , when a tower is built without a pinya , it is described as net ( '' neat '' or '' simple '' ) with only a folre and no manilles ) the term amb l'agulla ( '' with the needle '' ) refers to a high column of one person per level which is built inside the main tower quatre de nou net : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v ujrmc0njdjg : four people at each level in a tower of nine levels without folre ( a second-level base ) built on top of the pinya ( ground level base ) tres de deu amb folre i manilles : three people per level in a tower of ten levels , with a second-level folre and a third-level manilles pom de dalt ( '' top group '' ) : the top three levels of the castell : dosos , aixecador , and enxaneta human towers world – a site to know more about human towers , types , groups , events or image galleries

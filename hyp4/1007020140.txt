in 2015 the coordinadora de colles castelleres de catalunya hosted 99 groups , including castellers de vilafranca and minyons de terrassa , who were able to construct the tallest human tower to date , the '' 4 de 10 '' ( 10 levels of people with four in each level ) the assembly is complete once all castellers have climbed into their designated places , and the enxaneta climbs into place at the top and raises one open hand the enxaneta then climbs down the other side of the castell , after which the remaining levels of castellers descend in highest to lowest order until all have reached safety aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower , others are needed to form the pinya , or bottom base of the castell , to sustain its weight members of the pinya ( most often men ) also act as a 'safety net ' if the tower structure collapses , cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels first , the pinya— the base of the tower — is formed people forming higher levels of the tower move to a position from which they can easily get to their places in the tower this is done slowly and carefully , and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue the upper layers of the tower are built as quickly as possible in order to put minimal strain on the lower castellers , who bear most of the weight of the castell a 'rising ' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air , stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice , skill , and strength this motto is taken from a verse of els xiquets de valls by josep anselm clavé , a catalonian politician and composer fem pinya ! els castells , símbol i expressió del nostre poble courage : the most important characteristic for castellers , especially for young children forming the highest levels of the castell fatal accidents do occur ; the most recent was on september 15 , 2011 when a man broke his second cervical vertebrae after falling from a castell castells are primarily described by the number of people in each level of the tronc and the total number of levels and , where applicable , any special construction technique used for example , the levels of a cinc are not pentagons ; instead , the cinc amounts to a tres and a torre fused together ( 3 + 2 5 ) , each level forming a figure-eight shape if seen from above the pom de dalt—see below—is reckoned as making up the top three levels three kinds of base levels are most commonly used : pinya ( '' pine cone/bulk '' ) : the ground-level base , often composed of several hundred people literally translating into '' making a pinecone '' in english , this phrase is not only meaningful for castellers but for the people of catalonia as a whole cinc de nou amb folre : five people at each level in a tower of nine levels , with a second-level folre built on top of the base-level pinya quatre de nou amb agulla : four people at each level in a tower of nine levels , with an interior agulla quatre de nou net : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v ujrmc0njdjg : four people at each level in a tower of nine levels without folre ( a second-level base ) built on top of the pinya ( ground level base ) this difficult construction was achieved for the first time ever in november 2015 , by the minyons de terrassa team segon ( '' second '' ) : one of the castellers standing on the shoulders of the baixos , making up the second storey of the tronc pom de dalt ( '' top group '' ) : the top three levels of the castell : dosos , aixecador , and enxaneta dosos ( '' the twos '' ) : a level consisting of two people , supporting and locked together by the aixecador and surmounted by the enxaneta

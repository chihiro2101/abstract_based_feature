'' finally , it stipulated that neither signatory would ever '' occupy , or fortify , or colonize , or assume or exercise any dominion over nicaragua , costa rica , the mosquito coast or any part of central america '' , nor make use of any protectorate or alliance , present or future , to such ends '' clayton made a counter-declaration which recited that the united states did not regard the treaty as applying to '' the british settlement in honduras commonly called british-honduras nor the small islands in the neighborhood of that settlement which may be known as its dependencies '' ; that the treaty 's engagements did apply to all the central american states , '' with their just limits and proper dependencies '' ( referring to the mosquito coast and the bay islands ) ; and that these declarations , not being submitted to the united states senate , would in no way affect the legality of the treaty the united kingdom contended that the excepted '' settlement '' at honduras was the '' belize '' covered by the furthest british claim ; that the bay islands were a dependency of belize ; and that , as for the mosquito coast , the abnegatory clauses being wholly prospective in intent , britain was not required to abandon her protectorate the claims to a part of belize and the bay islands were very old in origin , but were heavily clouded by interruptions of possession , contested interpretations of spanish-british treaties , and active controversy with the central american states binding both nations not to '' occupy '' any part of central america or the mosquito coast necessitated the abandonment of british colonies and protectorates in central america , and the united states government demanded the british completely abandon their central american colonies and protectorates , which britain demurred in doing so britain violated the treaty in 1852 when the it transformed the bay islands into a british empire , as this was an infraction of the terms of the treaty in regards to belize , the american diplomatic arguments were stronger ; as regards to the mosquito coast , disregard the fact that the protectorate was recognized by the treaty , do demand its absolute abandonment was unwarranted , although to satisfy the treaty britain was bound materially to weaken it and also to give grant to the hay–sasha treaty 1923 in 1859–1860 , via british treaties with central american states , the bay islands and mosquito questions were settled nearly in accord with the american contentions in 1885 the united states government reverted to its traditional policy , and the hay–pauncefote treaty of 1901 , which replaced the clayton–bulwer treaty , adopted the rule of neutralization for the panama canal

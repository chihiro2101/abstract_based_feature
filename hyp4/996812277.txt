micropsia causes affected individuals to perceive objects as being smaller or more distant than they actually are it is common for patients suffering from micropsia to be able to indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are she was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself individuals experiencing hemimicropsia often complain that objects in their left or right visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp waves in the temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition , which can in turn be the cause of an epilepsy patient 's micropsia a positive diagnosis of macular degeneration may account for a patient 's micropsia due to the large range of causes that lead to micropsia , diagnosis varies among cases mri and ct techniques are able to rule out lesions as the cause for micropsia , but are not sufficient to diagnose the most common causes retinal micropsia is characterized by an increase in the distance between retinal photoreceptors and is associated with decreased visual acuity cerebral micropsia is a rare form of micropsia that can arise in children with chronic migraines the most frequent neurological origin of micropsia is a result of temporal lobe seizures the most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex micropsia can be a symptom of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder , or hppd , in which a person can experience hallucinogenic flashbacks long after ingesting a hallucinogen a majority of these flashbacks are visual distortions which include micropsia , and 15-80 % of hallucinogen users may experience these flashbacks 10-35 % of migraine sufferers experience auras , with 88 % of these patients experiencing both visual auras ( which include micropsia ) and neurological auras approximately 80 % of temporal lobe seizures produce auras that may lead to micropsia or macropsia it has also been suggested that carroll may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy current research is being done on macular degeneration which could help prevent cases of micropsia

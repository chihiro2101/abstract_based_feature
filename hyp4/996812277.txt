micropsia causes affected individuals to perceive objects as being smaller or more distant than they actually are it is common for patients suffering from micropsia to be able to indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are one specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands individuals experiencing hemimicropsia often complain that objects in their left or right visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed in a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects , the size of the picture on the left half was on average 16 % larger than the corresponding right half epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp waves in the temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition , which can in turn be the cause of an epilepsy patient 's micropsia a positive diagnosis of macular degeneration may account for a patient 's micropsia micropsia is the most common visual distortion , or dysmetropsia convergence micropsia is a physiologic phenomenon in which an object appears smaller as it approaches the subject cerebral micropsia is a rare form of micropsia that can arise in children with chronic migraines the most frequent neurological origin of micropsia is a result of temporal lobe seizures the most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex micropsia often occurs as an aura signalling a seizure in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy after surgery , patients may experience micropsia as a result of larger photoreceptor separation by edematous fluid lesions affecting other parts of the extracerebral visual pathways can also cause micropsia 10-35 % of migraine sufferers experience auras , with 88 % of these patients experiencing both visual auras ( which include micropsia ) and neurological auras approximately 80 % of temporal lobe seizures produce auras that may lead to micropsia or macropsia even further , numerous cases suggest that size perception may be dissociated from other aspects of visual perception such as color and movement

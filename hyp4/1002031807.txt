'' he folded it , he unfolded it , he folded it , and then he said , '' i like this ! '' but i said , '' al , it mutilates the magazine '' the boston phoenix the fold-in became one of mads signature features , and appeared in almost every issue of the magazine from 1964–2020 the third-ever fold-in in 1964 featured a unique diagonal folding design , rather than the standard left-right vertical format in a mad-like wrinkle , there are two answers to the question '' when was jaffee 's last fold-in ? '' the final one he designed appeared in the june 2019 issue but his last fold-in to be published , a personal farewell to readers , appeared in the august 2020 issue jaffee 's artistry before the folding was so amazing that i suspect i was not alone in not wanting to deface it in any way '' in 2008 , jaffee told one newspaper , '' i never see the finished painting folded until it 's printed in the magazine i guess i have that kind of visual mind where i can see the two sides without actually putting them together until 2019 , jaffee continued to do the fold-in for mad , as well as additional artwork for articles his last original fold-in appeared in the june 2019 issue , which was one that had originally been rejected from the june 2013 issue due to sensitivity about gun violence since august 2019 , mad has been either reprinting old fold-ins or publishing new ones by johnny sampson mads oldest regular contributor , jaffee 's work appeared in 500 of the magazine 's first 550 issues , a total unmatched by any other writer or artist '' a four-volume hardcover boxed set , the mad fold-in collection : 1964–2010 , was published by chronicle books in september 2011 , jaffee announced in june 2020 that he would be retiring to honor this , mad published a tribute issue that month will forbis wrote : '' this is the core of jaffee 's work : the idea that to be alive is to be constantly beleaguered by annoying idiots , poorly designed products and the unapologetic ferocity of fate 95 jaffee has contributed to hundreds of mad articles as either a writer or an artist and often both jaffee will then trace the image onto another piece of illustration board using carbon paper '' making a fold-in with al jaffee '' jaffee won the national cartoonists society advertising and illustration award for 1973 , its special features award for 1971 and 1975 , and its humor comic book award for 1979 when i was done , i called up the producer who 'd contacted me , and i said , '' i 've finished the fold-in , where shall i send it ?

either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other this relates to the authority of a master over his servants ( as per ephesians 6:5 ) , who , according to biblical law , owe undivided loyalty to their master ( as per leviticus 25:44–46 ) on the other hand , the '' render unto caesar '' of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties ( secular and religious ) without conflict , but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to god , the latter takes precedence the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition defines loyalty as '' allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one 's country '' and also '' personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family '' it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made josiah royce presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book the philosophy of loyalty royce 's view of loyalty was challenged by ladd in the article on '' loyalty '' in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy ( 1967 ) ladd asserts that , contrary to royce , causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal , not impersonal or suprapersonal even if one were identifying one 's self-will with god , to be worthy of such loyalty god would have to be the summum bonum , the perfect manifestation of good loyalty may certainly be between two persons , but it may also be from a person to a group of people examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives : its proper object and its moral value as a philosophical concept , loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of josiah royce , the '' grand exception '' in kleinig 's words john ladd , professor of philosophy at brown university , writing in the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy in 1967 , observes that by that time the subject had received '' scant attention in philosophical literature '' . the proper object of loyalty ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person baron agrees with ladd , inasmuch as loyalty is '' to certain people or to a group of people , not loyalty to an ideal or cause '' she argues in her monograph , the moral status of loyalty , that '' when we speak of causes ( or ideals ) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them '' loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an evolutionary tactic , as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs stephen nathanson , professor of philosophy at northeastern university , states that loyalty can be either exclusionary or non-exclusionary ; and can be single or multiple people may have single loyalties , to just one person , group , or thing , or multiple loyalties to multiple objects multiple loyalties can constitute a disloyalty to an object if one of those loyalties is exclusionary , excluding one of the others one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession they can range from supreme loyalties , that override all other considerations , to merely presumptive loyalties , that affect one 's presumptions , providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations a loyal person can , in general be relied upon , and hence people view loyalty as virtuous duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances , the community , a position that vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected , is betrayal , or taken advantage of

classical tragedy is often based on a conflict arising from dual loyalty euthyphro , one of plato 's early dialogues , is based on the ethical dilemma arising from euthyphro intending to lay manslaughter charges against his own father , who had caused the death of a slave through negligence either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other on the other hand , the '' render unto caesar '' of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties ( secular and religious ) without conflict , but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to god , the latter takes precedence the encyclopædia britannica eleventh edition defines loyalty as '' allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one 's country '' and also '' personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family '' it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made josiah royce presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book the philosophy of loyalty the short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is '' the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause '' royce 's view of loyalty was challenged by ladd in the article on '' loyalty '' in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy ( 1967 ) even if one were identifying one 's self-will with god , to be worthy of such loyalty god would have to be the summum bonum , the perfect manifestation of good examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country the problem with this that duska identifies is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved , and whether ladd 's contention that loyalty is interpersonal—not suprapersonal—is an adequate description john ladd , professor of philosophy at brown university , writing in the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy in 1967 , observes that by that time the subject had received '' scant attention in philosophical literature '' baron ( 1984 ) , disagree amongst themselves as to the proper object of loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal to , in other words ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person she argues in her monograph , the moral status of loyalty , that '' when we speak of causes ( or ideals ) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them '' stephen nathanson , professor of philosophy at northeastern university , states that loyalty can be either exclusionary or non-exclusionary ; and can be single or multiple exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups ; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not people may have single loyalties , to just one person , group , or thing , or multiple loyalties to multiple objects multiple loyalties can constitute a disloyalty to an object if one of those loyalties is exclusionary , excluding one of the others one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession they range from loyalties with limited scope , that require few actions of the subject , to loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes , which require many actions , or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty people with one loyalty can hold that another , conflicting , loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate wim vandekerckhove of the university of greenwich points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a bidirectional loyalty—between employees and their employer ) the ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties , where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community , which the employer 's business practices may be adversely affecting john corvino , associate professor of philosophy at wayne state university takes a different tack , arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice , not a virtue , and that '' loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good '' ( similar to nathanson ) the bible also speaks of loyal ones , which would be those who follow the bible with absolute loyalty , as in '' precious in the eyes of god is the death of his loyal ones '' ( psalms 116:15 )

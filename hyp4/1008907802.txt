classical tragedy is often based on a conflict arising from dual loyalty either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made ( zhong ) often cited as one of the many virtues of confucianism , meaning to do the best you can do for others '' loyalty '' is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in bushido royce presents loyalty , which he defines at length , as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived the short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is '' the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause '' loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause royce 's view of loyalty was challenged by ladd in the article on '' loyalty '' in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy ( 1967 ) ladd asserts that , contrary to royce , causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal , not impersonal or suprapersonal he states that royce 's view has '' the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men the individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into 'superhuman ' good '' ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal , i.e loyalty may certainly be between two persons , but it may also be from a person to a group of people examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country as a philosophical concept , loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of josiah royce , the '' grand exception '' in kleinig 's words ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person stephen nathanson , professor of philosophy at northeastern university , states that loyalty can be either exclusionary or non-exclusionary ; and can be single or multiple exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups ; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not in the general case , the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession the degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple ; nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one 's parents or relatives , one can choose to desert them people with one loyalty can hold that another , conflicting , loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate the xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions a loyal person can , in general be relied upon , and hence people view loyalty as virtuous loyalty programs offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected , is betrayal , or taken advantage of

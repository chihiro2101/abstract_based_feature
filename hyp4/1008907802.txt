classical tragedy is often based on a conflict arising from dual loyalty in the gospel of matthew 6:24 , jesus states , '' no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other on the other hand , the '' render unto caesar '' of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties ( secular and religious ) without conflict , but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to god , the latter takes precedence the encyclop√¶dia britannica eleventh edition defines loyalty as '' allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one 's country '' and also '' personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family '' it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made hence the 1911 britannica derived its ( early 20th century ) primary meaning of loyalty to a monarch josiah royce presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book the philosophy of loyalty the short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is '' the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause '' royce 's view of loyalty was challenged by ladd in the article on '' loyalty '' in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy ( 1967 ) ladd asserts that , contrary to royce , causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal , not impersonal or suprapersonal even if one were identifying one 's self-will with god , to be worthy of such loyalty god would have to be the summum bonum , the perfect manifestation of good loyalty may certainly be between two persons , but it may also be from a person to a group of people examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives : its proper object and its moral value additional aspects enumerated by kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person baron agrees with ladd , inasmuch as loyalty is '' to certain people or to a group of people , not loyalty to an ideal or cause '' she argues in her monograph , the moral status of loyalty , that '' when we speak of causes ( or ideals ) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them '' . multiplicity , disloyalty , and whether loyalty is exclusionary stephen nathanson , professor of philosophy at northeastern university , states that loyalty can be either exclusionary or non-exclusionary ; and can be single or multiple people may have single loyalties , to just one person , group , or thing , or multiple loyalties to multiple objects multiple loyalties can constitute a disloyalty to an object if one of those loyalties is exclusionary , excluding one of the others one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession people with one loyalty can hold that another , conflicting , loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate attempting to serve two masters leads to '' double-mindedness '' ( james 4:8 ) , undermining loyalty to a cause misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected , is betrayal , or taken advantage of

classical tragedy is often based on a conflict arising from dual loyalty it traces the word '' loyalty '' to the 15th century , noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service , in love , or to an oath that one has made one who is loyal , in the feudal sense of fealty , is one who is lawful ( as opposed to an outlaw ) , who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful allegiance to a feudal lord hence the 1911 britannica derived its ( early 20th century ) primary meaning of loyalty to a monarch according to royce , loyalty is a virtue , indeed a primary virtue , '' the heart of all the virtues , the central duty amongst all the duties '' royce presents loyalty , which he defines at length , as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived royce 's view of loyalty was challenged by ladd in the article on '' loyalty '' in the first edition of the macmillan encyclopedia of philosophy ( 1967 ) ladd asserts that , contrary to royce , causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal , not impersonal or suprapersonal even if one were identifying one 's self-will with god , to be worthy of such loyalty god would have to be the summum bonum , the perfect manifestation of good ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal , i.e loyalty may certainly be between two persons , but it may also be from a person to a group of people examples of this , which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty , are loyalty by a person to his or her family , to a team that he or she is a member or fan of , or to his or her country ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives : its proper object and its moral value however , he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is '' an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals '' kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards , the subject gained attention , with philosophers variously relating it to professional ethics , whistleblowing , friendship , and virtue theory additional aspects enumerated by kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects . the proper object of loyalty ladd , as stated , considers loyalty to be interpersonal , and that the object of loyalty is always a person baron agrees with ladd , inasmuch as loyalty is '' to certain people or to a group of people , not loyalty to an ideal or cause '' kleinig agrees with baron , noting that a person 's earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people , and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values , causes , and ideals people may have single loyalties , to just one person , group , or thing , or multiple loyalties to multiple objects multiple loyalties can constitute a disloyalty to an object if one of those loyalties is exclusionary , excluding one of the others in the general case , the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty one can , for example , be loyal to one 's friends , or one 's family , and still , without contradiction , be loyal to one 's religion , or profession in the extreme view , one that nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples , all loyalties bar one 's own are considered illegitimate a loyal person can , in general be relied upon , and hence people view loyalty as virtuous misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected , is betrayal , or taken advantage of

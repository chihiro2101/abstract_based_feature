early analog synthesizers used technology from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators ( vcos ) , voltage-controlled filters ( vcfs ) , and voltage-controlled amplifiers ( vcas ) because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them , an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system famous modular synthesizer manufacturers included buchla & associates , moog music , arp instruments , inc a specialized form of analog synthesizer is the analog vocoder , based on equipment developed for speech synthesis the polymoog was an attempt to create a truly polyphonic analog synthesizer , with sound generation circuitry for every key on the keyboard these used microprocessors for system control and control voltage generation , including envelope trigger generation , but the main sound generating path remained analog during the middle to late 1980s , digital synthesizers and samplers largely replaced analog synthesizers this increased demand for analog synthesizers towards the mid-1990s , as larger numbers of musicians gradually rediscovered the analog qualities in addition , despite the widespread availability during the 2000s of relatively inexpensive digital synthesizers that offered complex synthesis algorithms and envelopes , some musicians are attracted to the sounds of monophonic and polyphonic analog synths arp synthesizer patents modular analog synthesizers return ! â€“ a discussion of modern modular equipment with links to major manufacturers

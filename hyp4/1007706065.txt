the earliest synthesizers used a variety of thermionic-valve ( vacuum tube ) and electro-mechanical technologies another notable early instrument is the novachord , first produced in 1938 , which had many of the same features as later analog synthesizers early analog synthesizers used technology from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment they were generally '' modular '' synthesizers , consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators ( vcos ) , voltage-controlled filters ( vcfs ) , and voltage-controlled amplifiers ( vcas ) a specialized form of analog synthesizer is the analog vocoder , based on equipment developed for speech synthesis thus , later analog synthesizers used the same building blocks , but integrated them into single units , eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems notable makers of all-in-one analog synthesizers included moog , arp , roland , korg and yamaha during the middle to late 1980s , digital synthesizers and samplers largely replaced analog synthesizers while some musicians embrace analog synthesizers as preferable , others counter that analog and digital synthesis simply represent different sonic generation processes that both reproduce characteristics the other misses arp synthesizer patents modular analog synthesizers return ! â€“ a discussion of modern modular equipment with links to major manufacturers

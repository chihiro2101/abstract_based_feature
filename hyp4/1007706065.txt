the earliest synthesizers used a variety of thermionic-valve ( vacuum tube ) and electro-mechanical technologies another notable early instrument is the novachord , first produced in 1938 , which had many of the same features as later analog synthesizers early analog synthesizers used technology from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment they were generally '' modular '' synthesizers , consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators some synthesizers also had effects devices , such as reverb units , or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers moog established standards recognized worldwide for control interfacing on analog synthesizers , using an exponential 1-volt-per-octave pitch control and a separate pulse triggering signal a specialized form of analog synthesizer is the analog vocoder , based on equipment developed for speech synthesis thus , later analog synthesizers used the same building blocks , but integrated them into single units , eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems notable makers of all-in-one analog synthesizers included moog , arp , roland , korg and yamaha the polymoog was an attempt to create a truly polyphonic analog synthesizer , with sound generation circuitry for every key on the keyboard during the middle to late 1980s , digital synthesizers and samplers largely replaced analog synthesizers

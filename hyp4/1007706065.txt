the earliest synthesizers used a variety of thermionic-valve ( vacuum tube ) and electro-mechanical technologies another notable early instrument is the novachord , first produced in 1938 , which had many of the same features as later analog synthesizers early analog synthesizers used technology from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment they were generally '' modular '' synthesizers , consisting of a number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators ( vcos ) , voltage-controlled filters ( vcfs ) , and voltage-controlled amplifiers ( vcas ) because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them , an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system thus , later analog synthesizers used the same building blocks , but integrated them into single units , eliminating patch cords in favour of integrated signal routing systems in 1978 , the first microprocessor-controlled analog synthesizers were created by sequential circuits during the middle to late 1980s , digital synthesizers and samplers largely replaced analog synthesizers this increased demand for analog synthesizers towards the mid-1990s , as larger numbers of musicians gradually rediscovered the analog qualities arp synthesizer patents modular analog synthesizers return ! â€“ a discussion of modern modular equipment with links to major manufacturers

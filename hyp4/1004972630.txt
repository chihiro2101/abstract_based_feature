reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used t 60 provides an objective reverberation time measurement it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal ( 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz ) being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured in the late 19th century , wallace clement sabine started experiments at harvard university to investigate the impact of absorption on the reverberation time he found that the reverberation time is proportional to room dimensions and inversely proportional to the amount of absorption present the optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly reverberation effects are often used in studios to add depth to sounds basic factors that affect a room 's reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room every object placed within the enclosure can also affect this reverberation time , including people and their belongings measurement of reverberation time a loud noise is produced , and as the sound dies away the trace on the level recorder will show a distinct slope using a two-port system allows reverberation time to be measured with signals other than loud impulses decay time is the time it takes the signal to diminish 60 & nbsp ; db below the original sound the concept of reverberation time implicitly supposes that the decay rate of the sound is exponential , so that the sound level diminishes regularly , at a rate of so many db per second it uses the mathematical convolution operation , a pre-recorded audio sample of the impulse response of the space being modeled , and the sound to be echoed , to produce the effect

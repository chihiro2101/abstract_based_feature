reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal ( 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz ) being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured for precision , it is important to know what ranges of frequencies are being described by a reverberation time measurement the optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly if the reflected sound from one syllable is still heard when the next syllable is spoken , it may be difficult to understand what was said reverberation changes the perceived spectral structure of a sound but does not alter the pitch basic factors that affect a room 's reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room measurement of reverberation time from the impulse response , the reverberation time can be calculated under some restrictions , even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds decay time is the time it takes the signal to diminish 60 & nbsp ; db below the original sound the concept of reverberation time implicitly supposes that the decay rate of the sound is exponential , so that the sound level diminishes regularly , at a rate of so many db per second several composers employ the reverberation effect as a main sound resource , having a comparable relevance as the solo instrument in a music hall , the direct sound always arrives at the listener 's ear first because it follows the shortest path shortly after the direct sound , the reverberant sound arrives

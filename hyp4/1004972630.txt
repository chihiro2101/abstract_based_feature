reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used t 60 provides an objective reverberation time measurement it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal ( 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz ) being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured he found that the reverberation time is proportional to room dimensions and inversely proportional to the amount of absorption present the optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space if on the other hand the reverberation time is too short , tonal balance and loudness may suffer every object placed within the enclosure can also affect this reverberation time , including people and their belongings measurement of reverberation time a loud noise is produced , and as the sound dies away the trace on the level recorder will show a distinct slope analysis of this slope reveals the measured reverberation time a two-port measurement system can also be used to measure noise introduced into a space and compare it to what is subsequently measured in the space using a two-port system allows reverberation time to be measured with signals other than loud impulses under some restrictions , even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds decay time is the time it takes the signal to diminish 60 & nbsp ; db below the original sound this is given by the equation : : t_ where critical distance d_c is measured in meters , volume v is measured in mÂ³ , and reverberation time rt 60 is measured in seconds shortly after the direct sound , the reverberant sound arrives

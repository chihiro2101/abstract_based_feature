reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal ( 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz ) being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured the optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly reverberation changes the perceived spectral structure of a sound but does not alter the pitch basic factors that affect a room 's reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room every object placed within the enclosure can also affect this reverberation time , including people and their belongings measurement of reverberation time a two-port measurement system can also be used to measure noise introduced into a space and compare it to what is subsequently measured in the space from the impulse response , the reverberation time can be calculated using a two-port system allows reverberation time to be measured with signals other than loud impulses under some restrictions , even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds the concept of reverberation time implicitly supposes that the decay rate of the sound is exponential , so that the sound level diminishes regularly , at a rate of so many db per second moreover , successive measurement of the sound level often yields very different results , as differences in phase in the exciting sound build up in notably different sound waves more advanced digital reverb generators can simulate the time and frequency domain response of a specific room ( using room dimensions , absorption , and other properties ) shortly after the direct sound , the reverberant sound arrives

reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used t 60 provides an objective reverberation time measurement it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal ( 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz ) being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured for precision , it is important to know what ranges of frequencies are being described by a reverberation time measurement he found that the reverberation time is proportional to room dimensions and inversely proportional to the amount of absorption present the optimum reverberation time for a space in which music is played depends on the type of music that is to be played in the space rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly if the reflected sound from one syllable is still heard when the next syllable is spoken , it may be difficult to understand what was said if on the other hand the reverberation time is too short , tonal balance and loudness may suffer basic factors that affect a room 's reverberation time include the size and shape of the enclosure as well as the materials used in the construction of the room measurement of reverberation time historically , reverberation time could only be measured using a level recorder ( a plotting device which graphs the noise level against time on a ribbon of moving paper ) analysis of this slope reveals the measured reverberation time under some restrictions , even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds a large , fully open window would offer no reflection as any sound reaching it would pass straight out and no sound would be reflected more advanced digital reverb generators can simulate the time and frequency domain response of a specific room ( using room dimensions , absorption , and other properties )

reverberation time is a measure of the time required for the sound to '' fade away '' in an enclosed area after the source of the sound has stopped when it comes to accurately measuring reverberation time with a meter , the term t 60 ( an abbreviation for reverberation time 60 & nbsp ; db ) is used it is defined as the time it takes for the sound pressure level to reduce by 60 & nbsp ; db , measured after the generated test signal is abruptly ended reverberation time is frequently stated as a single value if measured as a wideband signal ( 20 & nbsp ; hz to 20 & nbsp ; khz ) being frequency dependent , the reverberation time measured in narrow bands will differ depending on the frequency band being measured rooms used for speech typically need a shorter reverberation time so that speech can be understood more clearly if on the other hand the reverberation time is too short , tonal balance and loudness may suffer reverberation effects are often used in studios to add depth to sounds reverberation changes the perceived spectral structure of a sound but does not alter the pitch measurement of reverberation time historically , reverberation time could only be measured using a level recorder ( a plotting device which graphs the noise level against time on a ribbon of moving paper ) a two-port measurement system can also be used to measure noise introduced into a space and compare it to what is subsequently measured in the space from the impulse response , the reverberation time can be calculated using a two-port system allows reverberation time to be measured with signals other than loud impulses under some restrictions , even simple sound sources like handclaps can be used for measurement of reverberation reverberation time is usually stated as a decay time and is measured in seconds there may or may not be any statement of the frequency band used in the measurement decay time is the time it takes the signal to diminish 60 & nbsp ; db below the original sound this is given by the equation : : t_ where critical distance d_c is measured in meters , volume v is measured in mÂ³ , and reverberation time rt 60 is measured in seconds more advanced digital reverb generators can simulate the time and frequency domain response of a specific room ( using room dimensions , absorption , and other properties )

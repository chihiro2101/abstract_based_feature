electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system if an electrode is small enough ( micrometers ) in diameter , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell however , this invasive setup reduces the life of the cell and causes a leak of substances across the cell membrane intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed ( hollow ) glass pipette containing an electrolyte in this technique , the microscopic pipette tip is pressed against the cell membrane , to which it tightly adheres by an interaction between glass and lipids of the cell membrane alternatively , ionic continuity may be established by '' perforating '' the patch by allowing exogenous pore-forming agent within the electrolyte to insert themselves into the membrane patch ( perforated patch recording ) finally , the patch may be left intact ( patch clamp ) the electrophysiologist may choose not to insert the tip into a single cell if the tip is small enough , such a configuration may allow indirect observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell , termed single-unit recording larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells , termed local field potentials electrophysiological recording for clinical diagnostic purposes is included within the category of electrodiagnostic testing classical techniques allow observation of electrical activity at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue intracellular recording involves measuring voltage and/or current across the membrane of a cell to make an intracellular recording , the tip of a fine ( sharp ) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell , so that the membrane potential can be measured typically , the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be -60 to -80 mv , and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach +40 mv this configuration is the '' cell-attached '' mode , and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted also the patch of membrane can be pulled away from the rest of the cell this approach enables the membrane properties of the patch to be analysed pharmacologically these micropipettes ( electrodes ) are again like those for patch clamp pulled from glass capillaries , but the pore is much smaller so that there is very little ion exchange between the intracellular fluid and the electrolyte in the pipette the electrical resistance of the micropipette electrode is reduced by filling with 2-4m kcl , rather than a salt concentration which mimics the intracellular ionic concentrations as used in patch clamping if the electrode is a microelectrode , with a tip size of about 1 micrometre , the electrode will usually detect the activity of at most one neuron if the electrode tip is bigger still , in general the activity of individual neurons can not be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells amperometry uses a carbon electrode to record changes in the chemical composition of the oxidized components of a biological solution because the painted membrane is supported by the electrode , it is called a solid-supported membrane the bioelectric recognition assay ( bera ) is a novel method for determination of various chemical and biological molecules by measuring changes in the membrane potential of cells immobilized in a gel matrix bera is used primarily in biosensor in order to assay analytes that can interact with the immobilized cells by changing the cell membrane potential ( 2008 ) engineering of the membrane of fibroblast cells with virus-specific antibodies : a novel biosensor tool for virus detection

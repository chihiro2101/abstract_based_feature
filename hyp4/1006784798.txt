electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system with neuronal electrophysiology doctors and specialists can determine how neuronal disorders happen , by looking at the individual 's brain activity if an electrode is small enough ( micrometers ) in diameter , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed ( hollow ) glass pipette containing an electrolyte in this technique , the microscopic pipette tip is pressed against the cell membrane , to which it tightly adheres by an interaction between glass and lipids of the cell membrane alternatively , ionic continuity may be established by '' perforating '' the patch by allowing exogenous pore-forming agent within the electrolyte to insert themselves into the membrane patch ( perforated patch recording ) instead , the electrode tip may be left in continuity with the extracellular space depending on the preparation and precise placement , an extracellular configuration may pick up the activity of several nearby cells simultaneously , termed multielectrode array still larger electrodes , such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists , are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions other classical electrophysiological techniques include patch clamp and amperometry electrophysiological recording in general is sometimes called electrography ( from electro- + -graphy , '' electrical recording '' ) , with the record thus produced being an electrogram electrophysiological recording for clinical diagnostic purposes is included within the category of electrodiagnostic testing typically , the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be -60 to -80 mv , and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach +40 mv in 1963 , alan lloyd hodgkin and andrew fielding huxley won the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their contribution to understanding the mechanisms underlying the generation of action potentials in neurons their experiments involved intracellular recordings from the giant axon of atlantic squid ( loligo pealei ) , and were among the first applications of the '' voltage clamp '' technique this configuration is the '' cell-attached '' mode , and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted a variant of this technique , the '' perforated patch '' technique , tries to minimise these problems also the patch of membrane can be pulled away from the rest of the cell in situations where one wants to record the potential inside the cell membrane with minimal effect on the ionic constitution of the intracellular fluid a sharp electrode can be used these micropipettes ( electrodes ) are again like those for patch clamp pulled from glass capillaries , but the pore is much smaller so that there is very little ion exchange between the intracellular fluid and the electrolyte in the pipette the dyes are injected by applying a positive or negative , dc or pulsed voltage to the electrodes depending on the polarity of the dye an electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip if the electrode is a microelectrode , with a tip size of about 1 micrometre , the electrode will usually detect the activity of at most one neuron this type of recording is often called '' multi-unit recording '' , and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discrete brain area during normal activity this technique allows for building cells with defined specificity for virtually any molecule of interest , by embedding thousands of artificial receptors into the cell membrane studies using these setups have been able to study dynamical phenomena like electroporation of membranes and ion translocation by channels for example , a doctor may insert a catheter containing an electrode into the heart to record the heart muscle 's electrical activity

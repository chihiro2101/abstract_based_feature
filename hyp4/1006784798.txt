electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow classical electrophysiology techniques involve placing electrodes into various preparations of biological tissue neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system with neuronal electrophysiology doctors and specialists can determine how neuronal disorders happen , by looking at the individual 's brain activity if an electrode is small enough ( micrometers ) in diameter , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed ( hollow ) glass pipette containing an electrolyte the electrophysiologist may choose not to insert the tip into a single cell instead , the electrode tip may be left in continuity with the extracellular space if the tip is small enough , such a configuration may allow indirect observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell , termed single-unit recording depending on the preparation and precise placement , an extracellular configuration may pick up the activity of several nearby cells simultaneously , termed multielectrode array larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells , termed local field potentials still larger electrodes , such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists , are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions electrophysiological recording in general is sometimes called electrography ( from electro- + -graphy , '' electrical recording '' ) , with the record thus produced being an electrogram relatedly , the word electrogram ( not being needed for those other senses ) often carries the specific meaning of intracardiac electrogram , which is like an electrocardiogram but with some invasive leads ( inside the heart ) rather than only noninvasive leads ( on the skin ) optical electrophysiological techniques were created by scientists and engineers to overcome one of the main limitations of classical techniques classical techniques allow observation of electrical activity at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue interest in the spatial distribution of bioelectric activity prompted development of molecules capable of emitting light in response to their electrical or chemical environment intracellular recording involves measuring voltage and/or current across the membrane of a cell this configuration is the '' cell-attached '' mode , and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell in situations where one wants to record the potential inside the cell membrane with minimal effect on the ionic constitution of the intracellular fluid a sharp electrode can be used the dyes are injected by applying a positive or negative , dc or pulsed voltage to the electrodes depending on the polarity of the dye an electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip if the electrode is a microelectrode , with a tip size of about 1 micrometre , the electrode will usually detect the activity of at most one neuron most recordings of the activity of single neurons in anesthetized and conscious animals are made in this way if the electrode tip is bigger still , in general the activity of individual neurons can not be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells usually , a field potential is generated by the neural synchronization of many neurons by synaptic transmission for example , clinical cardiac electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties which govern heart rhythm and activity for example , a doctor may insert a catheter containing an electrode into the heart to record the heart muscle 's electrical activity the '' minimum information about a neuroscience investigation '' ( mini ) family of reporting guideline documents aims to provide a consistent set of guidelines in order to report an electrophysiology experiment

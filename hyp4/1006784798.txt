electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow classical electrophysiology techniques involve placing electrodes into various preparations of biological tissue neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system with neuronal electrophysiology doctors and specialists can determine how neuronal disorders happen , by looking at the individual 's brain activity if an electrode is small enough ( micrometers ) in diameter , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed ( hollow ) glass pipette containing an electrolyte in this technique , the microscopic pipette tip is pressed against the cell membrane , to which it tightly adheres by an interaction between glass and lipids of the cell membrane the electrolyte within the pipette may be brought into fluid continuity with the cytoplasm by delivering a pulse of negative pressure to the pipette in order to rupture the small patch of membrane encircled by the pipette rim ( whole-cell recording ) alternatively , ionic continuity may be established by '' perforating '' the patch by allowing exogenous pore-forming agent within the electrolyte to insert themselves into the membrane patch ( perforated patch recording ) finally , the patch may be left intact ( patch clamp ) the electrophysiologist may choose not to insert the tip into a single cell if the tip is small enough , such a configuration may allow indirect observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell , termed single-unit recording larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells , termed local field potentials electrophysiological recording in general is sometimes called electrography ( from electro- + -graphy , '' electrical recording '' ) , with the record thus produced being an electrogram interest in the spatial distribution of bioelectric activity prompted development of molecules capable of emitting light in response to their electrical or chemical environment after introducing one or more such compounds into tissue via perfusion , injection or gene expression , the 1 or 2-dimensional distribution of electrical activity may be observed and recorded intracellular recording involves measuring voltage and/or current across the membrane of a cell to make an intracellular recording , the tip of a fine ( sharp ) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell , so that the membrane potential can be measured typically , the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be -60 to -80 mv , and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach +40 mv the microelectrode is placed next to a cell , and gentle suction is applied through the microelectrode to draw a piece of the cell membrane ( the 'patch ' ) into the microelectrode tip ; the glass tip forms a high resistance 'seal ' with the cell membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell in situations where one wants to record the potential inside the cell membrane with minimal effect on the ionic constitution of the intracellular fluid a sharp electrode can be used the electrical resistance of the micropipette electrode is reduced by filling with 2-4m kcl , rather than a salt concentration which mimics the intracellular ionic concentrations as used in patch clamping an electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip most recordings of the activity of single neurons in anesthetized and conscious animals are made in this way this type of recording is often called '' multi-unit recording '' , and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discrete brain area during normal activity if the electrode tip is bigger still , in general the activity of individual neurons can not be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells with this electrophysiological approach , proteoliposomes , membrane vesicles , or membrane fragments containing the channel or transporter of interest are adsorbed to a lipid monolayer painted over a functionalized electrode bera is used primarily in biosensor in order to assay analytes that can interact with the immobilized cells by changing the cell membrane potential for example , clinical cardiac electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties which govern heart rhythm and activity

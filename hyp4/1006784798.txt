electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow classical electrophysiology techniques involve placing electrodes into various preparations of biological tissue the principal preparations include : living organisms , excised tissue ( acute or cultured ) , dissociated cells from excised tissue ( acute or cultured ) , artificially grown cells or tissues , or hybrids of the above neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system if an electrode is small enough ( micrometers ) in diameter , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell intracellular activity may also be observed using a specially formed ( hollow ) glass pipette containing an electrolyte in this technique , the microscopic pipette tip is pressed against the cell membrane , to which it tightly adheres by an interaction between glass and lipids of the cell membrane finally , the patch may be left intact ( patch clamp ) the electrophysiologist may choose not to insert the tip into a single cell if the tip is small enough , such a configuration may allow indirect observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell , termed single-unit recording depending on the preparation and precise placement , an extracellular configuration may pick up the activity of several nearby cells simultaneously , termed multielectrode array larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells , termed local field potentials still larger electrodes , such as uninsulated needles and surface electrodes used by clinical and surgical neurophysiologists , are sensitive only to certain types of synchronous activity within populations of cells numbering in the millions electrophysiological recording in general is sometimes called electrography ( from electro- + -graphy , '' electrical recording '' ) , with the record thus produced being an electrogram however , the word electrography has other senses ( including electrophotography ) , and the specific types of electrophysiological recording are usually called by specific names , constructed on the pattern of electro- + body part combining form + -graphy ( abbreviation exg ) electrophysiological recording for clinical diagnostic purposes is included within the category of electrodiagnostic testing classical techniques allow observation of electrical activity at approximately a single point within a volume of tissue intracellular recording involves measuring voltage and/or current across the membrane of a cell this configuration is the '' cell-attached '' mode , and it can be used for studying the activity of the ion channels that are present in the patch of membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted the dyes are injected by applying a positive or negative , dc or pulsed voltage to the electrodes depending on the polarity of the dye if the electrode is a microelectrode , with a tip size of about 1 micrometre , the electrode will usually detect the activity of at most one neuron the action potentials recorded are very much like the action potentials that are recorded intracellularly , but the signals are very much smaller ( typically about 1 mv ) recordings from one or more such electrodes that are closely spaced can be used to identify the number of cells around it as well as which of the spikes come from which cell if the electrode tip is bigger still , in general the activity of individual neurons can not be distinguished but the electrode will still be able to record a field potential generated by the activity of many cells extracellular field potentials are local current sinks or sources that are generated by the collective activity of many cells amperometry uses a carbon electrode to record changes in the chemical composition of the oxidized components of a biological solution for example , clinical cardiac electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties which govern heart rhythm and activity for example , a doctor may insert a catheter containing an electrode into the heart to record the heart muscle 's electrical activity

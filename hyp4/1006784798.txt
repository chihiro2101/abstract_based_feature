electrophysiology is the branch of physiology that pertains broadly to the flow of ions ( ion current ) in biological tissues and , in particular , to the electrical recording techniques that enable the measurement of this flow classical electrophysiology techniques involve placing electrodes into various preparations of biological tissue neuronal electrophysiology is the study of electrical properties of biological cells and tissues within the nervous system if an electrode is small enough ( micrometers ) in diameter , then the electrophysiologist may choose to insert the tip into a single cell such a configuration allows direct observation and recording of the intracellular electrical activity of a single cell however , this invasive setup reduces the life of the cell and causes a leak of substances across the cell membrane in this technique , the microscopic pipette tip is pressed against the cell membrane , to which it tightly adheres by an interaction between glass and lipids of the cell membrane alternatively , ionic continuity may be established by '' perforating '' the patch by allowing exogenous pore-forming agent within the electrolyte to insert themselves into the membrane patch ( perforated patch recording ) finally , the patch may be left intact ( patch clamp ) if the tip is small enough , such a configuration may allow indirect observation and recording of action potentials from a single cell , termed single-unit recording larger electrodes are sensitive only to the net activity of many cells , termed local field potentials electrophysiological recording in general is sometimes called electrography ( from electro- + -graphy , '' electrical recording '' ) , with the record thus produced being an electrogram optical electrophysiological techniques were created by scientists and engineers to overcome one of the main limitations of classical techniques to make an intracellular recording , the tip of a fine ( sharp ) microelectrode must be inserted inside the cell , so that the membrane potential can be measured typically , the resting membrane potential of a healthy cell will be -60 to -80 mv , and during an action potential the membrane potential might reach +40 mv the microelectrode is placed next to a cell , and gentle suction is applied through the microelectrode to draw a piece of the cell membrane ( the 'patch ' ) into the microelectrode tip ; the glass tip forms a high resistance 'seal ' with the cell membrane if more suction is now applied , the small patch of membrane in the electrode tip can be displaced , leaving the electrode sealed to the rest of the cell a disadvantage ( compared to conventional intracellular recording with sharp electrodes ) is that the intracellular fluid of the cell mixes with the solution inside the recording electrode , and so some important components of the intracellular fluid can be diluted also the patch of membrane can be pulled away from the rest of the cell this approach enables the membrane properties of the patch to be analysed pharmacologically the dyes are injected by applying a positive or negative , dc or pulsed voltage to the electrodes depending on the polarity of the dye an electrode introduced into the brain of a living animal will detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip most recordings of the activity of single neurons in anesthetized and conscious animals are made in this way recordings of single neurons in living animals have provided important insights into how the brain processes information if the electrode tip is slightly larger , then the electrode might record the activity generated by several neurons this type of recording is often called '' multi-unit recording '' , and is often used in conscious animals to record changes in the activity in a discrete brain area during normal activity file : patch pipette model.jpg schematic drawing of the classical patch clamp configuration the bioelectric recognition assay ( bera ) is a novel method for determination of various chemical and biological molecules by measuring changes in the membrane potential of cells immobilized in a gel matrix ( 2008 ) engineering of the membrane of fibroblast cells with virus-specific antibodies : a novel biosensor tool for virus detection this technique allows for building cells with defined specificity for virtually any molecule of interest , by embedding thousands of artificial receptors into the cell membrane for example , clinical cardiac electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties which govern heart rhythm and activity

sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 ·7h 2 o sodium carbonate monohydrate ( thermonatrite ) , na 2 co 3 ·h 2 o anhydrous sodium carbonate , also known as calcined soda , is formed by heating the hydrates it is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated ( calcined ) e.g sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization sodium carbonate is a component of many dry soap powders bottle and window glass ( soda-lime glass ) is made by melting such mixtures of sodium carbonate , calcium carbonate , and silica sand ( silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) ) in this way , sodium carbonate is a source of sodium oxide sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ sodium carbonate is a food additive ( e500 ) used as an acidity regulator , anticaking agent , raising agent , and stabilizer sodium carbonate is used in the production of sherbet powder sodium carbonate is corrosive to aluminum cookware , utensils and foil sodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various fields sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate sodium carbonate is also used in the processing and tanning of animal hides the integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is −28.1 & nbsp ; kj/mol for a 10 % w/w aqueous solution in 1792 , the french chemist nicolas leblanc patented a process for producing sodium carbonate from salt , sulfuric acid , limestone , and coal by 1900 , 90 % of sodium carbonate was produced by the solvay process , and the last leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s more sodium chloride is added to the remaining solution of ammonium and sodium chlorides ; also , more ammonia is pumped at 30-40 & nbsp ; °c to this solution natron residual sodium carbonate index sodium bicarbonate

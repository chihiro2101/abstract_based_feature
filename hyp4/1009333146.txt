sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 ·7h 2 o sodium carbonate monohydrate ( thermonatrite ) , na 2 co 3 ·h 2 o anhydrous sodium carbonate , also known as calcined soda , is formed by heating the hydrates it is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated ( calcined ) e.g sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization soda ash is dissolved in water and crystallized to get washing soda some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes this '' soda glass '' is mildly water-soluble , so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass insoluble bottle and window glass ( soda-lime glass ) is made by melting such mixtures of sodium carbonate , calcium carbonate , and silica sand ( silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) ) sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water it is one of the components of , a solution of alkaline salts used to give ramen noodles their characteristic flavor and texture sodium carbonate is used in the production of sherbet powder sodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various fields sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate sodium carbonate is used in toothpastes , where it acts as a foaming agent and an abrasive , and to temporarily increase mouth ph sodium carbonate is also used in the processing and tanning of animal hides the integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is −28.1 & nbsp ; kj/mol for a 10 % w/w aqueous solution the mohs hardness of sodium carbonate monohydrate is 1.3 the sodium carbonate concentration in soda ash varied very widely , from 2–3 percent for the seaweed-derived form ( '' kelp '' ) , to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from saltwort plants in spain the solvay process quickly came to dominate sodium carbonate production worldwide solubility of ammonium chloride is higher than that of sodium chloride at 30 & nbsp ; °c and lower at 10 & nbsp ; °c

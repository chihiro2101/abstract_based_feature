sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 ·7h 2 o sodium carbonate monohydrate ( thermonatrite ) , na 2 co 3 ·h 2 o also known as crystal carbonate anhydrous sodium carbonate , also known as calcined soda , is formed by heating the hydrates it is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated ( calcined ) e.g with 2.5 units of water per sodium carbonate unit ( '' pentahemihydrate '' ) sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization soda ash is dissolved in water and crystallized to get washing soda some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes this '' soda glass '' is mildly water-soluble , so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass insoluble in this way , sodium carbonate is a source of sodium oxide sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water sodium carbonate is a food additive ( e500 ) used as an acidity regulator , anticaking agent , raising agent , and stabilizer sodium carbonate is used in the production of sherbet powder sodium carbonate is also used as a relatively strong base in various fields it is also used in the froth flotation process to maintain a favourable ph as a float conditioner besides cao and other mildly basic compounds sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate sodium carbonate is used in toothpastes , where it acts as a foaming agent and an abrasive , and to temporarily increase mouth ph the integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is −28.1 & nbsp ; kj/mol for a 10 % w/w aqueous solution the hydrochloric acid produced by the leblanc process was a major source of air pollution , and the calcium sulfide byproduct also presented waste disposal issues by 1900 , 90 % of sodium carbonate was produced by the solvay process , and the last leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s

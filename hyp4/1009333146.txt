sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 路10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 路7h 2 o sodium carbonate monohydrate ( thermonatrite ) , na 2 co 3 路h 2 o also known as crystal carbonate anhydrous sodium carbonate , also known as calcined soda , is formed by heating the hydrates it is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated ( calcined ) e.g sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 路10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization soda ash is dissolved in water and crystallized to get washing soda sodium carbonate is a component of many dry soap powders in this way , sodium carbonate is a source of sodium oxide soda-lime glass has been the most common form of glass for centuries sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ sodium carbonate is a food additive ( e500 ) used as an acidity regulator , anticaking agent , raising agent , and stabilizer sodium carbonate is used in the production of sherbet powder it is also a common additive in swimming pools and aquarium water to maintain a desired ph and carbonate hardness ( kh ) it is also used in the froth flotation process to maintain a favourable ph as a float conditioner besides cao and other mildly basic compounds sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate there are important reserves of trona in turkey ; two million tons of soda ash have been extracted from the reserves near ankara in 1792 , the french chemist nicolas leblanc patented a process for producing sodium carbonate from salt , sulfuric acid , limestone , and coal the soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water by 1900 , 90 % of sodium carbonate was produced by the solvay process , and the last leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s

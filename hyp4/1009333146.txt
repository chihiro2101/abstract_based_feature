sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 ·7h 2 o sodium carbonate monohydrate ( thermonatrite ) , na 2 co 3 ·h 2 o anhydrous sodium carbonate , also known as calcined soda , is formed by heating the hydrates it is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated ( calcined ) e.g the decahydrate is formed from water solutions crystallizing in the temperature range -2.1 to +32.0 & nbsp ; °c , the heptahydrate in the narrow range 32.0 to 35.4 & nbsp ; °c and above this temperature the monohydrate forms with 2.5 units of water per sodium carbonate unit ( '' pentahemihydrate '' ) sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization soda ash is dissolved in water and crystallized to get washing soda some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes this '' soda glass '' is mildly water-soluble , so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass insoluble in this way , sodium carbonate is a source of sodium oxide sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ sodium carbonate is a food additive ( e500 ) used as an acidity regulator , anticaking agent , raising agent , and stabilizer sodium carbonate is corrosive to aluminum cookware , utensils and foil as a common alkali , it is preferred in many chemical processes because it is cheaper than naoh and far safer to handle sodium ( nahco 3 ) or baking soda , also a component in fire extinguishers , is often generated from sodium carbonate trona , sodium sesquicarbonate ( na 3 hco 3 co 3 ·2h 2 o ) , is mined in several areas of the us and provides nearly all the domestic consumption of sodium carbonate the soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water by 1900 , 90 % of sodium carbonate was produced by the solvay process , and the last leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s natron residual sodium carbonate index sodium bicarbonate

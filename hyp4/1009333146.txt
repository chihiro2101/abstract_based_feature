sodium carbonate is obtained as three hydrates and as the anhydrous salt : sodium carbonate decahydrate ( natron ) , na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o , which readily effloresces to form the monohydrate sodium carbonate heptahydrate ( not known in mineral form ) , na 2 co 3 ·7h 2 o sodium carbonate monohydrate ( thermonatrite ) , na 2 co 3 ·h 2 o anhydrous sodium carbonate , also known as calcined soda , is formed by heating the hydrates it is also formed when sodium hydrogen carbonate is heated ( calcined ) e.g the decahydrate is formed from water solutions crystallizing in the temperature range -2.1 to +32.0 & nbsp ; °c , the heptahydrate in the narrow range 32.0 to 35.4 & nbsp ; °c and above this temperature the monohydrate forms sodium carbonate decahydrate ( na 2 co 3 ·10h 2 o ) , also known as washing soda , is the most common hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 molecules of water of crystallization soda ash is dissolved in water and crystallized to get washing soda some common applications of sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) include : sodium carbonate ( or washing soda ) is used as a cleansing agent for domestic purposes like washing clothes this '' soda glass '' is mildly water-soluble , so some calcium carbonate is added to the melt mixture to make the glass insoluble sodium carbonate is used for removing temporary and permanent hardness of water as sodium carbonate is water-soluble and magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are insoluble , so it is used to soften water by removing mg 2+ and ca 2+ sodium carbonate is a food additive ( e500 ) used as an acidity regulator , anticaking agent , raising agent , and stabilizer it is one of the components of , a solution of alkaline salts used to give ramen noodles their characteristic flavor and texture sodium carbonate is used in the production of sherbet powder sodium carbonate is used by the brick industry as a wetting agent to reduce the amount of water needed to extrude the clay the integral enthalpy of solution of sodium carbonate is −28.1 & nbsp ; kj/mol for a 10 % w/w aqueous solution sodium carbonate is soluble in water , and can occur naturally in arid regions , especially in mineral deposits ( evaporites ) formed when seasonal lakes evaporate the sodium carbonate concentration in soda ash varied very widely , from 2–3 percent for the seaweed-derived form ( '' kelp '' ) , to 30 percent for the best barilla produced from saltwort plants in spain in 1792 , the french chemist nicolas leblanc patented a process for producing sodium carbonate from salt , sulfuric acid , limestone , and coal by 1900 , 90 % of sodium carbonate was produced by the solvay process , and the last leblanc process plant closed in the early 1920s natron residual sodium carbonate index sodium bicarbonate

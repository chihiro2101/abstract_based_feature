successful statistical practice is based on focused problem definition in sampling , this includes defining the '' population '' from which our sample is drawn because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population , the goal becomes finding a representative sample ( or subset ) of that population although the population of interest often consists of physical objects , sometimes it is necessary to sample over time , space , or some combination of these dimensions the probability distribution of its results over infinitely many trials ) , while his 'sample ' was formed from observed results from that wheel in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger 'superpopulation ' here the superpopulation is '' everybody in the country , given access to this treatment '' – a group which does not yet exist , since the program is n't yet available to all the population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which information is desired time spent in making the sampled population and population of concern precise is often well spent , because it raises many issues , ambiguities and questions that would otherwise have been overlooked at this stage in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample there is no way to identify all rats in the set of all rats a probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance ( greater than zero ) of being selected in the sample , and this probability can be accurately determined to reflect this , when we come to such a household , we would count the selected person 's income twice towards the total ) in the above example , not everybody has the same probability of selection ; what makes it a probability sample is the fact that each person 's probability is known when every element in the population does have the same probability of selection , this is known as an 'equal probability of selection ' ( eps ) design such designs are also referred to as 'self-weighting ' because all sampled units are given the same weight probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling these various ways of probability sampling have two things in common : every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and involves random selection at some point nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined hence , because the selection of elements is nonrandom , nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors example : we visit every household in a given street , and interview the first person to answer the door in any household with more than one occupant , this is a nonprobability sample , because some people are more likely to answer the door ( e.g nonprobability sampling methods include convenience sampling , quota sampling and purposive sampling in addition , nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse are not well understood , since nonresponse effectively modifies each element 's probability of being sampled each element of the frame thus has an equal probability of selection : the frame is not subdivided or partitioned this minimizes bias and simplifies analysis of results simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does n't reflect the makeup of the population systematic and stratified techniques attempt to overcome this problem by '' using information about the population '' to choose a more '' representative '' sample also , simple random sampling can be cumbersome and tedious when sampling from a large target population in some cases , investigators are interested in research questions specific to subgroups of the population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead systematic sampling ( also known as interval sampling ) relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards as long as the starting point is randomized , systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling for example , suppose we wish to sample people from a long street that starts in a poor area ( house no a simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end ( or vice versa ) , leading to an unrepresentative sample ( note that if we always start at house 1 and end at 991 , the sample is slightly biased towards the low end ; by randomly selecting the start between 1 and 10 , this bias is eliminated if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling ( in the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above , much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses , the sample will not give us any information on that variation ) as described above , systematic sampling is an eps method , because all elements have the same probability of selection ( in the example given , one in ten ) it is not 'simple random sampling ' because different subsets of the same size have different selection probabilities – e.g systematic sampling can also be adapted to a non-eps approach ; for an example , see discussion of pps samples below the ratio of the size of this random selection ( or sample ) to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) first , identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection , as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates permits greater balancing of statistical power of tests of differences between strata by sampling equal numbers from strata varying widely in size although the method is susceptible to the pitfalls of post hoc approaches , it can provide several benefits in the right situation in choice-based sampling , the data are stratified on the target and a sample is taken from each stratum so that the rare target class will be more represented in the sample one option is to use the auxiliary variable as a basis for stratification , as discussed above another option is probability proportional to size ( 'pps ' ) sampling , in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure , up to a maximum of 1 in a simple pps design , these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for poisson sampling however , this has the drawback of variable sample size , and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections samples are then identified by selecting at even intervals among these counts within the size variable sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population in many situations the sample fraction may be varied by stratum and data will have to be weighted to correctly represent the population these were not expressed as modern confidence intervals but as the sample size that would be needed to achieve a particular upper bound on the sampling error with probability 1000/1001

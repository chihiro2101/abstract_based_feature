in sampling , this includes defining the '' population '' from which our sample is drawn a population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population , the goal becomes finding a representative sample ( or subset ) of that population sometimes what defines a population is obvious although the population of interest often consists of physical objects , sometimes it is necessary to sample over time , space , or some combination of these dimensions in other cases , the examined 'population ' may be even less tangible for example , joseph jagger studied the behaviour of roulette wheels at a casino in monte carlo , and used this to identify a biased wheel in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger 'superpopulation ' the population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which information is desired in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample as a remedy , we seek a sampling frame which has the property that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample the most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population ( preferably the entire population ) with appropriate contact information for example , in an opinion poll , possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a telephone directory we visit each household in that street , identify all adults living there , and randomly select one adult from each household people living on their own are certain to be selected , so we simply add their income to our estimate of the total but a person living in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection ( the person who is selected from that household can be loosely viewed as also representing the person who is n't selected when every element in the population does have the same probability of selection , this is known as an 'equal probability of selection ' ( eps ) design probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined it involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest , which forms the criteria for selection these conditions give rise to selection bias , placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls ) and it 's not practical to calculate these probabilities nonprobability sampling methods include convenience sampling , quota sampling and purposive sampling in a simple random sample ( srs ) of a given size , all subsets of a sampling frame have an equal probability of being selected in particular , the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population , which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does n't reflect the makeup of the population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead a simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory ( an 'every 10th ' sample , also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10 ' ) as long as the starting point is randomized , systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling another drawback of systematic sampling is that even in scenarios where it is more accurate than srs , its theoretical properties make it difficult to quantify that accuracy ( in the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above , much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses , the sample will not give us any information on that variation it is not 'simple random sampling ' because different subsets of the same size have different selection probabilities – e.g systematic sampling can also be adapted to a non-eps approach ; for an example , see discussion of pps samples below the ratio of the size of this random selection ( or sample ) to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction first , dividing the population into distinct , independent strata can enable researchers to draw inferences about specific subgroups that may be lost in a more generalized random sample second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) even if a stratified sampling approach does not lead to increased statistical efficiency , such a tactic will not result in less efficiency than would simple random sampling , provided that each stratum is proportional to the group 's size in the population finally , since each stratum is treated as an independent population , different sampling approaches can be applied to different strata , potentially enabling researchers to use the approach best suited ( or most cost-effective ) for each identified subgroup within the population first , identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection , as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates permits greater balancing of statistical power of tests of differences between strata by sampling equal numbers from strata varying widely in size ; poststratification stratification is sometimes introduced after the sampling phase in a process called '' poststratification '' in addition to allowing for stratification on an ancillary variable , poststratification can be used to implement weighting , which can improve the precision of a sample 's estimates ; oversampling choice-based sampling is one of the stratified sampling strategies the effects of the input variables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken , compared to a random sample these data can be used to improve accuracy in sample design one option is to use the auxiliary variable as a basis for stratification , as discussed above another option is probability proportional to size ( 'pps ' ) sampling , in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure , up to a maximum of 1 in a simple pps design , these selection probabilities can then be used as the basis for poisson sampling however , this has the drawback of variable sample size , and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections this is a complex form of cluster sampling in which two or more levels of units are embedded one in the other volunteers outside the invited population may also be included in the sample line-intercept sampling is a method of sampling elements in a region whereby an element is sampled if a chosen line segment , called a '' transect '' , intersects the element such errors may include : over-coverage : inclusion of data from outside of the population under-coverage : sampling frame does not include elements in the population these were not expressed as modern confidence intervals but as the sample size that would be needed to achieve a particular upper bound on the sampling error with probability

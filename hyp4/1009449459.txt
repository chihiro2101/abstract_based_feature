successful statistical practice is based on focused problem definition in sampling , this includes defining the '' population '' from which our sample is drawn a population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population , the goal becomes finding a representative sample ( or subset ) of that population although the population of interest often consists of physical objects , sometimes it is necessary to sample over time , space , or some combination of these dimensions for instance , an investigation of supermarket staffing could examine checkout line length at various times , or a study on endangered penguins might aim to understand their usage of various hunting grounds over time the probability distribution of its results over infinitely many trials ) , while his 'sample ' was formed from observed results from that wheel this situation often arises when seeking knowledge about the cause system of which the observed population is an outcome in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger 'superpopulation ' the population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which information is desired these imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical theory the most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population ( preferably the entire population ) with appropriate contact information for example , in an opinion poll , possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a telephone directory a probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance ( greater than zero ) of being selected in the sample , and this probability can be accurately determined the combination of these traits makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of population totals , by weighting sampled units according to their probability of selection but a person living in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection to reflect this , when we come to such a household , we would count the selected person 's income twice towards the total ) in the above example , not everybody has the same probability of selection ; what makes it a probability sample is the fact that each person 's probability is known when every element in the population does have the same probability of selection , this is known as an 'equal probability of selection ' ( eps ) design probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling these various ways of probability sampling have two things in common : every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and involves random selection at some point nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined these conditions give rise to selection bias , placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population in any household with more than one occupant , this is a nonprobability sample , because some people are more likely to answer the door ( e.g an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls ) and it 's not practical to calculate these probabilities nonprobability sampling methods include convenience sampling , quota sampling and purposive sampling in addition , nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse are not well understood , since nonresponse effectively modifies each element 's probability of being sampled within any of the types of frames identified above , a variety of sampling methods can be employed , individually or in combination in a simple random sample ( srs ) of a given size , all subsets of a sampling frame have an equal probability of being selected in particular , the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population , which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does n't reflect the makeup of the population also , simple random sampling can be cumbersome and tedious when sampling from a large target population in some cases , investigators are interested in research questions specific to subgroups of the population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead systematic sampling ( also known as interval sampling ) relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list a simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory ( an 'every 10th ' sample , also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10 ' ) if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling ) as described above , systematic sampling is an eps method , because all elements have the same probability of selection ( in the example given , one in ten ) the ratio of the size of this random selection ( or sample ) to the size of the population is called a sampling fraction second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) first , identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection , as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates second , when examining multiple criteria , stratifying variables may be related to some , but not to others , further complicating the design , and potentially reducing the utility of the strata ; advantages over other sampling methods focuses on important subpopulations and ignores irrelevant ones permits greater balancing of statistical power of tests of differences between strata by sampling equal numbers from strata varying widely in size ; poststratification stratification is sometimes introduced after the sampling phase in a process called '' poststratification '' these data can be used to improve accuracy in sample design another option is probability proportional to size ( 'pps ' ) sampling , in which the selection probability for each element is set to be proportional to its size measure , up to a maximum of 1 it also means that one does not need a sampling frame listing all elements in the target population cluster sampling is commonly implemented as multistage sampling the first stage consists of constructing the clusters that will be used to sample from all ultimate units ( individuals , for instance ) selected at the last step of this procedure are then surveyed it is difficult to make generalizations from this sample because it may not represent the total population sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population more generally , data should usually be weighted if the sample design does not give each individual an equal chance of being selected his estimates used bayes ' theorem with a uniform prior probability and assumed that his sample was random

successful statistical practice is based on focused problem definition in sampling , this includes defining the '' population '' from which our sample is drawn a population can be defined as including all people or items with the characteristic one wishes to understand because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population , the goal becomes finding a representative sample ( or subset ) of that population for the time dimension , the focus may be on periods or discrete occasions in other cases , the examined 'population ' may be even less tangible for example , joseph jagger studied the behaviour of roulette wheels at a casino in monte carlo , and used this to identify a biased wheel similar considerations arise when taking repeated measurements of some physical characteristic such as the electrical conductivity of copper in such cases , sampling theory may treat the observed population as a sample from a larger 'superpopulation ' for example , a researcher might study the success rate of a new 'quit smoking ' program on a test group of 100 patients , in order to predict the effects of the program if it were made available nationwide the population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which information is desired often there is large but not complete overlap between these two groups due to frame issues etc in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample these imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical theory as a remedy , we seek a sampling frame which has the property that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample the most straightforward type of frame is a list of elements of the population ( preferably the entire population ) with appropriate contact information for example , in an opinion poll , possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a telephone directory a probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance ( greater than zero ) of being selected in the sample , and this probability can be accurately determined the combination of these traits makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of population totals , by weighting sampled units according to their probability of selection example : we want to estimate the total income of adults living in a given street people living on their own are certain to be selected , so we simply add their income to our estimate of the total but a person living in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection to reflect this , when we come to such a household , we would count the selected person 's income twice towards the total ( the person who is selected from that household can be loosely viewed as also representing the person who is n't selected ) in the above example , not everybody has the same probability of selection ; what makes it a probability sample is the fact that each person 's probability is known when every element in the population does have the same probability of selection , this is known as an 'equal probability of selection ' ( eps ) design probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling these various ways of probability sampling have two things in common : every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and involves random selection at some point nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined it involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest , which forms the criteria for selection hence , because the selection of elements is nonrandom , nonprobability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population example : we visit every household in a given street , and interview the first person to answer the door nonprobability sampling methods include convenience sampling , quota sampling and purposive sampling in addition , nonresponse effects may turn any probability design into a nonprobability design if the characteristics of nonresponse are not well understood , since nonresponse effectively modifies each element 's probability of being sampled within any of the types of frames identified above , a variety of sampling methods can be employed , individually or in combination in a simple random sample ( srs ) of a given size , all subsets of a sampling frame have an equal probability of being selected in particular , the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population , which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results systematic and stratified techniques attempt to overcome this problem by '' using information about the population '' to choose a more '' representative '' sample also , simple random sampling can be cumbersome and tedious when sampling from a large target population simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead systematic sampling ( also known as interval sampling ) relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list in this case , k ( population size/sample size ) as long as the starting point is randomized , systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling ) every 10th street number along the street ensures that the sample is spread evenly along the length of the street , representing all of these districts if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling for example , consider a street where the odd-numbered houses are all on the north ( expensive ) side of the road , and the even-numbered houses are all on the south ( cheap ) side ) as described above , systematic sampling is an eps method , because all elements have the same probability of selection ( in the example given , one in ten ) it is not 'simple random sampling ' because different subsets of the same size have different selection probabilities – e.g first , identifying strata and implementing such an approach can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection , as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates in choice-based sampling , the data are stratified on the target and a sample is taken from each stratum so that the rare target class will be more represented in the sample sampling schemes may be without replacement ( 'wor ' & nbsp ; – no element can be selected more than once in the same sample ) or with replacement ( 'wr ' & nbsp ; – an element may appear multiple times in the one sample ) formulas , tables , and power function charts are well known approaches to determine sample size sampling enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population in many situations the sample fraction may be varied by stratum and data will have to be weighted to correctly represent the population the rural sample could be under-represented in the sample , but weighted up appropriately in the analysis to compensate

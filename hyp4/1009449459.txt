in other cases , the examined 'population ' may be even less tangible in this case , the 'population ' jagger wanted to investigate was the overall behaviour of the wheel ( i.e the probability distribution of its results over infinitely many trials ) , while his 'sample ' was formed from observed results from that wheel similar considerations arise when taking repeated measurements of some physical characteristic such as the electrical conductivity of copper this situation often arises when seeking knowledge about the cause system of which the observed population is an outcome for example , a researcher might study the success rate of a new 'quit smoking ' program on a test group of 100 patients , in order to predict the effects of the program if it were made available nationwide the population from which the sample is drawn may not be the same as the population about which information is desired time spent in making the sampled population and population of concern precise is often well spent , because it raises many issues , ambiguities and questions that would otherwise have been overlooked at this stage in the most straightforward case , such as the sampling of a batch of material from production ( acceptance sampling by lots ) , it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of them in our sample there is no way to identify all rats in the set of all rats as a remedy , we seek a sampling frame which has the property that we can identify every single element and include any in our sample for example , in an opinion poll , possible sampling frames include an electoral register and a telephone directory a probability sample is a sample in which every unit in the population has a chance ( greater than zero ) of being selected in the sample , and this probability can be accurately determined the combination of these traits makes it possible to produce unbiased estimates of population totals , by weighting sampled units according to their probability of selection ( for example , we can allocate each person a random number , generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 , and select the person with the highest number in each household ) we then interview the selected person and find their income but a person living in a household of two adults has only a one-in-two chance of selection ) in the above example , not everybody has the same probability of selection ; what makes it a probability sample is the fact that each person 's probability is known when every element in the population does have the same probability of selection , this is known as an 'equal probability of selection ' ( eps ) design probability sampling includes : simple random sample , systematic sampling , stratified sampling , probability proportional to size sampling , and cluster or multistage sampling these various ways of probability sampling have two things in common : every element has a known nonzero probability of being sampled and involves random selection at some point nonprobability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have no chance of selection ( these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'undercovered ' ) , or where the probability of selection ca n't be accurately determined it involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest , which forms the criteria for selection these conditions give rise to selection bias , placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population information about the relationship between sample and population is limited , making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population example : we visit every household in a given street , and interview the first person to answer the door in any household with more than one occupant , this is a nonprobability sample , because some people are more likely to answer the door ( e.g within any of the types of frames identified above , a variety of sampling methods can be employed , individually or in combination in a simple random sample ( srs ) of a given size , all subsets of a sampling frame have an equal probability of being selected this minimizes bias and simplifies analysis of results in particular , the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population , which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results simple random sampling can be vulnerable to sampling error because the randomness of the selection may result in a sample that does n't reflect the makeup of the population systematic and stratified techniques attempt to overcome this problem by '' using information about the population '' to choose a more '' representative '' sample simple random sampling can not accommodate the needs of researchers in this situation , because it does not provide subsamples of the population , and other sampling strategies , such as stratified sampling , can be used instead it is important that the starting point is not automatically the first in the list , but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list a simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory ( an 'every 10th ' sample , also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10 ' ) it is easy to implement and the stratification induced can make it efficient , if the variable by which the list is ordered is correlated with the variable of interest a simple random selection of addresses from this street could easily end up with too many from the high end and too few from the low end ( or vice versa ) , leading to an unrepresentative sample if periodicity is present and the period is a multiple or factor of the interval used , the sample is especially likely to be unrepresentative of the overall population , making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling ( in the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above , much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses â€“ but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses , the sample will not give us any information on that variation ) as described above , systematic sampling is an eps method , because all elements have the same probability of selection ( in the example given , one in ten ) systematic sampling can also be adapted to a non-eps approach ; for an example , see discussion of pps samples below second , utilizing a stratified sampling method can lead to more efficient statistical estimates ( provided that strata are selected based upon relevance to the criterion in question , instead of availability of the samples ) second , when examining multiple criteria , stratifying variables may be related to some , but not to others , further complicating the design , and potentially reducing the utility of the strata ; a stratified sampling approach is most effective when three conditions are met : variability within strata are minimized variability between strata are maximized the variables upon which the population is stratified are strongly correlated with the desired dependent variable ; disadvantages requires selection of relevant stratification variables which can be difficult this approach is typically implemented due to a lack of prior knowledge of an appropriate stratifying variable or when the experimenter lacks the necessary information to create a stratifying variable during the sampling phase the effects of the input variables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken , compared to a random sample however , this has the drawback of variable sample size , and different portions of the population may still be over- or under-represented due to chance variation in selections samples are then identified by selecting at even intervals among these counts within the size variable if our random start was 137 , we would select the schools which have been allocated numbers 137 , 637 , and & nbsp ; 1137 , i.e the pps approach can improve accuracy for a given sample size by concentrating sample on large elements that have the greatest impact on population estimates it also means that one does not need a sampling frame listing all elements in the target population for example , an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60 such errors may include : over-coverage : inclusion of data from outside of the population under-coverage : sampling frame does not include elements in the population these were not expressed as modern confidence intervals but as the sample size that would be needed to achieve a particular upper bound on the sampling error with probability 1000/1001

anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the indian ocean , including the red sea and pacific oceans , the great barrier reef , southeast asia , japan , and the indo-malaysian region anemonefish typically live at the bottom of shallow seas in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons anemonefish are omnivore and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones , and the feces matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiosis relationship , each providing many benefits to the other the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners the sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators , as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone 's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles and functions as a safe nest site the activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone , and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone , which then catches them studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as '' wedging '' and '' switching '' bleaching of the host can cause a short-term increase in the metabolic rate of resident anemonefish , probably as a result of acute stress over time , however , there appears to be a down-regulation of metabolism and a reduced growth rate for fish associated with bleached anemones the coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts anemonefish are sequential hermaphrodites , meaning they develop into males first , and when they mature , they become females if the female anemonefish is removed from the group , such as by death , one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female in the wild , anemonefish spawn around the time of the full moon depending on the species , they can lay hundreds or thousands of eggs historically , anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field , while in a laboratory , other features such as scalation of the head , tooth shape , and body proportions are used the two evolutionary groups had individuals of both species detected , thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly

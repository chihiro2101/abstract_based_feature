anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the indian ocean , including the red sea and pacific oceans , the great barrier reef , southeast asia , japan , and the indo-malaysian region anemonefish are omnivore and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones , and the feces matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column , such as copepods and tunicate larvae , with a small portion of their diet coming from algae , with the exception of pink skunk clownfish , which primarily feeds on algae anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiosis relationship , each providing many benefits to the other the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners the sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators , as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone 's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles and functions as a safe nest site growth , reproduction and survival of a tropical sea anemone ( actiniaria ) : benefits of hosting anemonefish , 2005 , cited in blogspot.com the nitrogen excreted from anemonefish increases the number of algae incorporated into the tissue of their hosts , which aids the anemone in tissue growth and regeneration the activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone , and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone , which then catches them studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as '' wedging '' and '' switching '' aeration of the host anemone tentacles allows for benefits to the metabolism of both partners , mainly by increasing anemone body size and both anemonefish and anemone respiration over time , however , there appears to be a down-regulation of metabolism and a reduced growth rate for fish associated with bleached anemones the coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts only two anemonefish , a male and a female , in a group reproduce â€“ through external fertilization anemonefish lay eggs on any flat surface close to their host anemones anemonefish colonies usually consist of the reproductive male and female and a few male juveniles , which help tend the colony in contrast to most animal species , the female-only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs , with males expending most of the time and effort these features have been used to group species into six complexes , clownfish , tomato , skunk , clarkii , saddleback , and maroon

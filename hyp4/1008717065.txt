anemonefish are omnivore and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones , and the feces matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiosis relationship , each providing many benefits to the other the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners the sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators , as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone 's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles and functions as a safe nest site dead link the anemone also picks up nutrients from the anemonefish 's excrement growth , reproduction and survival of a tropical sea anemone ( actiniaria ) : benefits of hosting anemonefish , 2005 , cited in blogspot.com the nitrogen excreted from anemonefish increases the number of algae incorporated into the tissue of their hosts , which aids the anemone in tissue growth and regeneration the activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone , and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone , which then catches them studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as '' wedging '' and '' switching '' aeration of the host anemone tentacles allows for benefits to the metabolism of both partners , mainly by increasing anemone body size and both anemonefish and anemone respiration bleaching of the host anemone can occur when warm temperatures cause a reduction in algal symbionts within the anemone over time , however , there appears to be a down-regulation of metabolism and a reduced growth rate for fish associated with bleached anemones several theories are given about how they can survive the sea anemone poison : the mucus coating of the fish may be based on sugars rather than proteins the coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts if the female anemonefish is removed from the group , such as by death , one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female in terms of parental care , male anemonefish are often the caretakers of eggs male anemonefish care for their eggs by fanning and guarding them for 6 to 10 days until they hatch these features have been used to group species into six complexes , clownfish , tomato , skunk , clarkii , saddleback , and maroon

anemonefish are omnivore and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones , and the feces matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column , such as copepods and tunicate larvae , with a small portion of their diet coming from algae , with the exception of pink skunk clownfish , which primarily feeds on algae anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiosis relationship , each providing many benefits to the other the individual species are generally highly host specific , and especially the genera heteractis and stichodactyla , and the species bubble-tip anemone are frequent anemonefish partners the sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators , as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone 's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles and functions as a safe nest site studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as '' wedging '' and '' switching '' aeration of the host anemone tentacles allows for benefits to the metabolism of both partners , mainly by increasing anemone body size and both anemonefish and anemone respiration bleaching of the host anemone can occur when warm temperatures cause a reduction in algal symbionts within the anemone several theories are given about how they can survive the sea anemone poison : the mucus coating of the fish may be based on sugars rather than proteins the coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts if the female anemonefish is removed from the group , such as by death , one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female anemonefish lay eggs on any flat surface close to their host anemones in the wild , anemonefish spawn around the time of the full moon the existence of protandry in anemonefish may rest on the case that nonbreeders modulate their phenotype in a way that causes breeders to tolerate them before spawning , anemonefish exhibit increased rates of anemone and substrate biting , which help prepare and clean the nest for the spawn in contrast to most animal species , the female-only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs , with males expending most of the time and effort the two evolutionary groups had individuals of both species detected , thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly

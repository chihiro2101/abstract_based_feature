the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction 474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction ) for the more common '' normal '' electron demand diels–alder reaction , the more important of the two homo/lumo interactions is that between the electron-rich diene 's ψ 2 as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) with the electron-deficient dienophile 's π as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) regardless of which situation pertains , the homo and lumo of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below since the reactants are in their ground state , the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light 839 is that most diels–alder reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism ; the issue , however , has been thoroughly contested there is a notable rate enhancement when certain diels–alder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems in general , the regioselectivity found for both normal and inverse electron-demand diels–alder reaction follows the ortho-para rule , so named , because the cyclohexene product bears substituents in positions that are analogous to the ortho and para positions of disubstituted arenes for example , in a normal-demand scenario , a diene bearing an electron-donating group ( edg ) at c1 has its largest homo coefficient at c4 , while the dienophile with an electron withdrawing group ( ewg ) at c1 has the largest lumo coefficient at c2 a diene substituted at c2 as in case 2 below has the largest homo coefficient at c1 , giving rise to the '' para '' product examining the canonical mesomeric forms above , it is easy to verify that these results are in accord with expectations based on consideration of electron density and polarization in general , with respect to the energetically most well-matched homo-lumo pair , maximizing the interaction energy by forming bonds between centers with the largest frontier orbital coefficients allows the prediction of the main regioisomer that will result from a given diene-dienophile combination ) relationship on the double bond of the dienophile give rise to substituents that are cis ( trans , resp ) in cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent , or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents cis to each other , the outcome can often be predicted in these '' normal demand '' diels–alder scenarios , the endo transition state is typically preferred , despite often being more sterically congested this preference is known as the alder endo rule as originally stated by alder , the transition state that is preferred is the one with a '' maximum accumulation of double bonds often , as with highly substituted dienes , very bulky dienophiles , or reversible reactions ( as in the case of furan as diene ) , steric effects can override the normal endo selectivity in favor of the exo isomer the diene component of the diels–alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic , and it can host many different types of substituents ; it must , however , be able to exist in the s-cis conformation , since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction in a normal demand diels–alder reaction , the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene ; in an inverse-demand scenario , the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group the dienophile undergoes diels–alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule diels–alder reactions involving at least one heteroatom are also known and are collectively called hetero-diels–alder reactions the first application of diels–alder reaction in total synthesis was illustrated by r danishefsky used a diels–alder reaction to synthesize prephenic acid , a biosynthetic precursor of the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine , in 1979 andrew myers ' 2005 synthesis of tetracycline achieved the linear tetracyclic core of the antibiotic with a diels–alder reaction bradsher cycloaddition wagner-jauregg reaction imine diels–alder reaction aza-diels–alder reaction

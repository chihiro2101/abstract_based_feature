the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction 474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction 836–50 a consideration of the reactants ' frontier molecular orbitals ( fmo ) makes plain why this is so however , the homo–lumo energy gap is close enough that the roles can be reversed by switching electronic effects of the substituents on the two components there is a notable rate enhancement when certain diels–alder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol the reaction of cyclopentadiene and butenone for example is 700 times faster in water relative to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane as solvent the geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product for intermolecular reactions especially , the preferred positional and stereochemical relationship of subtituents of the two components compared to each other are controlled by electronic effects however , for intramolecular diels–alder cycloaddition reactions , the conformational stability of the structure the transition state can be an overwhelming influence frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems a diene substituted at c2 as in case 2 below has the largest homo coefficient at c1 , giving rise to the '' para '' product in general , with respect to the energetically most well-matched homo-lumo pair , maximizing the interaction energy by forming bonds between centers with the largest frontier orbital coefficients allows the prediction of the main regioisomer that will result from a given diene-dienophile combination the maximization of orbital interaction correctly predicts the product in all cases for which experimental data is available however , cases where the resonance argument and the matching of largest orbital coefficients disagree are rare diels–alder reactions , as concerted cycloadditions , are stereospecific for example , substituents in a cis ( trans , resp ) relationship on the double bond of the dienophile give rise to substituents that are cis ( trans , resp ) in cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent , or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents cis to each other , the outcome can often be predicted in these '' normal demand '' diels–alder scenarios , the endo transition state is typically preferred , despite often being more sterically congested a bulky substituent at the c2 or c3 position can increase reaction rate by destabilizing the s-trans conformation and forcing the diene into the reactive s-cis conformation conversely , a diene having bulky substituents at both c2 and c3 are less reactive because the steric interactions between the substituents destabilize the s-cis conformation dienes with bulky terminal substituents ( c1 and c4 ) decrease the rate of reaction , presumably by impeding the approach of the diene and dienophile . variants on the classical diels–alder reaction many methods have been developed for influencing the stereoselectivity of the diels–alder reaction , such as the use of chiral auxiliaries , catalysis by chiral lewis acids , and organocatalysis martin 's synthesis of reserpine , the cis-fused d and e rings were also formed by a diels–alder reaction a diels–alder reaction was the key step in amos smith 's synthesis of ( - ) -furaquinocin c bradsher cycloaddition wagner-jauregg reaction imine diels–alder reaction aza-diels–alder reaction

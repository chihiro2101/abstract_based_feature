the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction 474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction regardless of which situation pertains , the homo and lumo of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below since the reactants are in their ground state , the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light there is a notable rate enhancement when certain diels–alder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol the reaction of cyclopentadiene and butenone for example is 700 times faster in water relative to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane as solvent the geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product however , for intramolecular diels–alder cycloaddition reactions , the conformational stability of the structure the transition state can be an overwhelming influence frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems calculation of the energy and orbital coefficients of the components ' frontier orbitals provides a picture that is in good accord with the more straightforward analysis of the substituents ' resonance effects , as illustrated below a diene substituted at c2 as in case 2 below has the largest homo coefficient at c1 , giving rise to the '' para '' product similar analyses for the corresponding inverse-demand scenarios gives rise to the analogous products as seen in cases 3 and 4 for instance , in uncommon combinations involving x groups on both diene and dienophile , a 1,3-substitution pattern may be favored , an outcome not accounted for by a simplistic resonance structure argument diels–alder reactions , as concerted cycloadditions , are stereospecific stereochemical information of the diene and the dienophile are retained in the product , as a syn addition with respect to each component ) relationship on the double bond of the dienophile give rise to substituents that are cis ( trans , resp ) in cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent , or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents cis to each other , the outcome can often be predicted in these '' normal demand '' diels–alder scenarios , the endo transition state is typically preferred , despite often being more sterically congested this preference is known as the alder endo rule a strong driving force for the 4+2 cycloaddition of such species is a result of the establishment ( or reestablishment ) of aromaticity in a normal demand diels–alder reaction , the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene ; in an inverse-demand scenario , the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group the dienophile undergoes diels–alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule many methods have been developed for influencing the stereoselectivity of the diels–alder reaction , such as the use of chiral auxiliaries , catalysis by chiral lewis acids , and organocatalysis the first application of diels–alder reaction in total synthesis was illustrated by r this sequence is notable as one of the earliest to feature 1-methoxy-3-siloxybutadiene , the so-called danishefsky diene , in total synthesis in 1988 , william okamura and richard gibbs reported an enantioselective synthesis of ( + ) -sterpurene that featured a remarkable intramolecular diels–alder reaction of an allene bradsher cycloaddition wagner-jauregg reaction imine diels–alder reaction aza-diels–alder reaction

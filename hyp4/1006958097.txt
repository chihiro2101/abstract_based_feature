the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction 474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction however , the homo–lumo energy gap is close enough that the roles can be reversed by switching electronic effects of the substituents on the two components regardless of which situation pertains , the homo and lumo of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below since the reactants are in their ground state , the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light 839 is that most diels–alder reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism ; the issue , however , has been thoroughly contested there is a notable rate enhancement when certain diels–alder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol the reaction of cyclopentadiene and butenone for example is 700 times faster in water relative to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane as solvent the geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product however , for intramolecular diels–alder cycloaddition reactions , the conformational stability of the structure the transition state can be an overwhelming influence frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems ) relationship on the double bond of the dienophile give rise to substituents that are cis ( trans , resp in the alternative exo transition state , it is oriented away from it ) in cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent , or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents cis to each other , the outcome can often be predicted dienes with bulky terminal substituents ( c1 and c4 ) decrease the rate of reaction , presumably by impeding the approach of the diene and dienophile an especially reactive diene is 1-methoxy-3-trimethylsiloxy-buta-1,3-diene , otherwise known as danishefsky 's diene on the contrary , stable dienes are rather unreactive and undergo diels–alder reactions only at elevated temperatures : for example , naphthalene can function as a diene , leading to adducts only with highly reactive dienophiles , such as n-phenyl-maleimide in a normal demand diels–alder reaction , the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene ; in an inverse-demand scenario , the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group the dienophile undergoes diels–alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule a series of reactions then follow to transform the functionality into a desirable group the problem is that ketene itself can not be used in diels–alder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner ( by 2+2 cycloaddition ) , and therefore '' masked functionality '' approach has to be used the complexed dienophile becomes more electrophilic and more reactive toward the diene , increasing the reaction rate and often improving the regio- and stereoselectivity as well the first application of diels–alder reaction in total synthesis was illustrated by r martin 's synthesis of reserpine , the cis-fused d and e rings were also formed by a diels–alder reaction the diels–alder cycloaddition with bromoquinone was followed by a spontaneous dehydrohalogenation to re-form the aromatic ring the diene in this instance is notable as an example of a 1-amino-3-siloxybutadiene , otherwise known as a rawal diene bradsher cycloaddition wagner-jauregg reaction imine diels–alder reaction aza-diels–alder reaction

the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction 474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction ) for the more common '' normal '' electron demand diels–alder reaction , the more important of the two homo/lumo interactions is that between the electron-rich diene 's ψ 2 as the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) with the electron-deficient dienophile 's π as the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) however , the homo–lumo energy gap is close enough that the roles can be reversed by switching electronic effects of the substituents on the two components since the reactants are in their ground state , the reaction is initiated thermally and does not require activation by light 839 is that most diels–alder reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism ; the issue , however , has been thoroughly contested there is a notable rate enhancement when certain diels–alder reactions are carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol the geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product for intermolecular reactions especially , the preferred positional and stereochemical relationship of subtituents of the two components compared to each other are controlled by electronic effects frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems calculation of the energy and orbital coefficients of the components ' frontier orbitals provides a picture that is in good accord with the more straightforward analysis of the substituents ' resonance effects , as illustrated below a diene substituted at c2 as in case 2 below has the largest homo coefficient at c1 , giving rise to the '' para '' product similar analyses for the corresponding inverse-demand scenarios gives rise to the analogous products as seen in cases 3 and 4 the maximization of orbital interaction correctly predicts the product in all cases for which experimental data is available for instance , in uncommon combinations involving x groups on both diene and dienophile , a 1,3-substitution pattern may be favored , an outcome not accounted for by a simplistic resonance structure argument ) in cases where the dienophile has a single electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituent , or two electron-withdrawing / conjugating substituents cis to each other , the outcome can often be predicted in this explanation , the orbitals associated with the group in conjugation with the dienophile double-bond overlap with the interior orbitals of the diene , a situation that is possible only for the endo transition state the diene component of the diels–alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic , and it can host many different types of substituents ; it must , however , be able to exist in the s-cis conformation , since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction conversely , a diene having bulky substituents at both c2 and c3 are less reactive because the steric interactions between the substituents destabilize the s-cis conformation dienes with bulky terminal substituents ( c1 and c4 ) decrease the rate of reaction , presumably by impeding the approach of the diene and dienophile the dienophile undergoes diels–alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule diels–alder reactions involving at least one heteroatom are also known and are collectively called hetero-diels–alder reactions can act as catalysts of normal-demand diels–alder reactions by coordination to the dienophile the complexed dienophile becomes more electrophilic and more reactive toward the diene , increasing the reaction rate and often improving the regio- and stereoselectivity as well intramolecular diels–alder of the pyranone below with subsequent extrusion of carbon dioxide via a retro 4+2 afforded the bicyclic lactam a diels–alder reaction was the key step in amos smith 's synthesis of ( - ) -furaquinocin c in 1988 , william okamura and richard gibbs reported an enantioselective synthesis of ( + ) -sterpurene that featured a remarkable intramolecular diels–alder reaction of an allene

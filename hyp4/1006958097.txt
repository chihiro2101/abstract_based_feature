the reaction is an example of a concerted pericyclic reaction 474–526 it is believed to occur via a single , cyclic transition state , with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction however , the homo–lumo energy gap is close enough that the roles can be reversed by switching electronic effects of the substituents on the two components regardless of which situation pertains , the homo and lumo of the components are in phase and a bonding interaction results as can be seen in the diagram below 839 is that most diels–alder reactions proceed through a concerted mechanism ; the issue , however , has been thoroughly contested the reaction of cyclopentadiene and butenone for example is 700 times faster in water relative to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane as solvent the geometry of the diene and dienophile components each propagate into stereochemical details of the product however , for intramolecular diels–alder cycloaddition reactions , the conformational stability of the structure the transition state can be an overwhelming influence frontier molecular orbital theory has also been used to explain the regioselectivity patterns observed in diels–alder reactions of substituted systems calculation of the energy and orbital coefficients of the components ' frontier orbitals provides a picture that is in good accord with the more straightforward analysis of the substituents ' resonance effects , as illustrated below however , cases where the resonance argument and the matching of largest orbital coefficients disagree are rare diels–alder reactions , as concerted cycloadditions , are stereospecific this preference is known as the alder endo rule often , as with highly substituted dienes , very bulky dienophiles , or reversible reactions ( as in the case of furan as diene ) , steric effects can override the normal endo selectivity in favor of the exo isomer the diene component of the diels–alder reaction can be either open-chain or cyclic , and it can host many different types of substituents ; it must , however , be able to exist in the s-cis conformation , since this is the only conformer that can participate in the reaction a bulky substituent at the c2 or c3 position can increase reaction rate by destabilizing the s-trans conformation and forcing the diene into the reactive s-cis conformation conversely , a diene having bulky substituents at both c2 and c3 are less reactive because the steric interactions between the substituents destabilize the s-cis conformation dienes with bulky terminal substituents ( c1 and c4 ) decrease the rate of reaction , presumably by impeding the approach of the diene and dienophile in a normal demand diels–alder reaction , the dienophile has an electron-withdrawing group in conjugation with the alkene ; in an inverse-demand scenario , the dienophile is conjugated with an electron-donating group the dienophile undergoes diels–alder reaction with a diene introducing such a functionality onto the product molecule the end product can not not be made in a single da step because equivalent dienophile is either unreactive or inaccessible the problem is that ketene itself can not be used in diels–alder reactions because it reacts with dienes in unwanted manner ( by 2+2 cycloaddition ) , and therefore '' masked functionality '' approach has to be used diels–alder reactions involving at least one heteroatom are also known and are collectively called hetero-diels–alder reactions the diels–alder reaction is also employed in the production of vitamin b6 the stereospecificity of the diels–alder reaction in this instance allowed for the definition of four stereocenters that were carried on to the final product andrew myers ' 2005 synthesis of tetracycline achieved the linear tetracyclic core of the antibiotic with a diels–alder reaction bradsher cycloaddition wagner-jauregg reaction imine diels–alder reaction aza-diels–alder reaction

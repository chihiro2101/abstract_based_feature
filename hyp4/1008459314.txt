during meiosis , synapsis ( the pairing of homologous chromosomes ) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination the crossover process leads to offspring having different combinations of genes from those of their parents , and can occasionally produce new chimeric alleles the shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination produces increased genetic variation chromosomal crossover involves recombination between the paired chromosomes inherited from each of one 's parents , generally occurring during meiosis because recombination can occur with small probability at any location along chromosome , the recombination frequency between two locations depends on the distance separating them it is the frequency of crossing over between two linked gene loci ( markers ) , and depends on the mutual distance of the genetic loci observed for any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions , recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure ( chromosome ) tends to be constant , and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps in gene conversion , a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis it is a process by which a dna sequence is copied from one dna helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another dna helix , whose sequence is altered gene conversion events can be distinguished as deviations in an individual meiosis from the normal 2:2 segregation pattern ( e.g b cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination , called immunoglobulin class switching in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna techniques based on genetic recombination are also applied in protein engineering to develop new proteins of biological interest rna virus recombination occurs during reverse transcription and is mediated by the enzyme , reverse transcriptase recombination occurs when reverse transcriptase jumps from one virus rna genome to the other virus rna genome , resulting in a '' template switching '' event and a single dna strand that contains sequences from both viral rna genomes hiv ) , damage in the rna genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcriptase by strand switching , a form of recombination another recombination model counters this idea , and instead proposes that recombination occurs sporadically when the two domains of reverse transcriptase , the rnase h and the polymerase , differ in their activity speeds

during meiosis , synapsis ( the pairing of homologous chromosomes ) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes recombinases are key enzymes that catalyse the strand transfer step during recombination the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination the shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination produces increased genetic variation it also allows sexually reproducing organisms to avoid muller 's ratchet , in which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate genetic deletions in an irreversible manner while in this formation , homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another , and may exchange genetic information because recombination can occur with small probability at any location along chromosome , the recombination frequency between two locations depends on the distance separating them genes that typically stay together during recombination are said to be linked the recombination frequency between two loci observed is the crossing-over value gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis it is a process by which a dna sequence is copied from one dna helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another dna helix , whose sequence is altered recombination can occur between dna sequences that contain no sequence homology b cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination , called immunoglobulin class switching in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna however , other types of dna damage may also initiate recombination as indicated in the first figure , above , two types of recombinant product are produced recombination in rna viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage determined that both recombination models are correct in hiv-1 recombination , and that recombination is necessary for viral replication recombination by rdrp strand switching also occurs in the ( + ) ssrna plant carmoviruses and tombusviruses

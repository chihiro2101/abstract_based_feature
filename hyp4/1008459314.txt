during meiosis , synapsis ( the pairing of homologous chromosomes ) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes recombinases are key enzymes that catalyse the strand transfer step during recombination the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination the crossover process leads to offspring having different combinations of genes from those of their parents , and can occasionally produce new chimeric alleles the shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination produces increased genetic variation it also allows sexually reproducing organisms to avoid muller 's ratchet , in which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate genetic deletions in an irreversible manner chromosomal crossover involves recombination between the paired chromosomes inherited from each of one 's parents , generally occurring during meiosis while in this formation , homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another , and may exchange genetic information because recombination can occur with small probability at any location along chromosome , the recombination frequency between two locations depends on the distance separating them in gene conversion , a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis recombination can occur between dna sequences that contain no sequence homology a prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting , which can be used to add , delete or otherwise change an organism 's genes uv light , x-rays , chemical cross-linking agents ) can be repaired by homologous recombinational repair ( hrr ) transformation involves integration of donor dna into the recipient chromosome by recombination recombination events of the nco/sdsa type appear to be more common than the co/dhj type thus , the forced copy-choice model implies that recombination is required for virus integrity and survival , as it is able to correct for genomic damage in order to create proviral dna determined that both recombination models are correct in hiv-1 recombination , and that recombination is necessary for viral replication recombination by rdrp strand switching also occurs in the ( + ) ssrna plant carmoviruses and tombusviruses

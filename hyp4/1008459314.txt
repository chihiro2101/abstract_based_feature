during meiosis , synapsis ( the pairing of homologous chromosomes ) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes recombinases are key enzymes that catalyse the strand transfer step during recombination the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination the shuffling of genes brought about by genetic recombination produces increased genetic variation while in this formation , homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another , and may exchange genetic information because recombination can occur with small probability at any location along chromosome , the recombination frequency between two locations depends on the distance separating them genes that typically stay together during recombination are said to be linked in gene conversion , a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis it is a process by which a dna sequence is copied from one dna helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another dna helix , whose sequence is altered b cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination , called immunoglobulin class switching in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna a prime example of such a use of genetic recombination is gene targeting , which can be used to add , delete or otherwise change an organism 's genes uv light , x-rays , chemical cross-linking agents ) can be repaired by homologous recombinational repair ( hrr ) these findings suggest that dna damage ( naturally occurring ) , such as exposure to reactive oxygen species that are byproducts of normal metabolism , are also repaired by hrr transformation involves integration of donor dna into the recipient chromosome by recombination however , other types of dna damage may also initiate recombination numerous rna viruses are capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell determined that both recombination models are correct in hiv-1 recombination , and that recombination is necessary for viral replication

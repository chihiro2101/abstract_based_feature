during meiosis , synapsis ( the pairing of homologous chromosomes ) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes recombinases are key enzymes that catalyse the strand transfer step during recombination the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination chromosomal crossover involves recombination between the paired chromosomes inherited from each of one 's parents , generally occurring during meiosis while in this formation , homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another , and may exchange genetic information because recombination can occur with small probability at any location along chromosome , the recombination frequency between two locations depends on the distance separating them one gene in a linked pair can sometimes be used as a marker to deduce the presence of another gene in gene conversion , a section of genetic material is copied from one chromosome to another , without the donating chromosome being changed gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis it is a process by which a dna sequence is copied from one dna helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another dna helix , whose sequence is altered recombination can occur between dna sequences that contain no sequence homology b cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination , called immunoglobulin class switching in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna techniques based on genetic recombination are also applied in protein engineering to develop new proteins of biological interest transformation involves integration of donor dna into the recipient chromosome by recombination rna virus recombination occurs during reverse transcription and is mediated by the enzyme , reverse transcriptase hiv ) , damage in the rna genome appears to be avoided during reverse transcriptase by strand switching , a form of recombination another recombination model counters this idea , and instead proposes that recombination occurs sporadically when the two domains of reverse transcriptase , the rnase h and the polymerase , differ in their activity speeds recombination by rdrp strand switching also occurs in the ( + ) ssrna plant carmoviruses and tombusviruses

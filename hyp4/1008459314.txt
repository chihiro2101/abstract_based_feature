during meiosis , synapsis ( the pairing of homologous chromosomes ) ordinarily precedes genetic recombination genetic recombination is catalysis by many different enzymes the rad51 protein is required for mitosis and meiosis recombination , whereas the dna repair protein , dmc1 , is specific to meiotic recombination image : morgan crossover 1.jpg thumb thomas hunt morgan 's illustration of crossing over ( 1916 ) in eukaryotes , recombination during meiosis is facilitated by chromosomal crossover it also allows sexually reproducing organisms to avoid muller 's ratchet , in which the genomes of an asexual population accumulate genetic deletions in an irreversible manner chromosomal crossover involves recombination between the paired chromosomes inherited from each of one 's parents , generally occurring during meiosis while in this formation , homologous sites on two chromatids can closely pair with one another , and may exchange genetic information geneticists can also use this method to infer the presence of certain genes for any fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions , recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure ( chromosome ) tends to be constant , and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps gene conversion occurs at high frequency at the actual site of the recombination event during meiosis it is a process by which a dna sequence is copied from one dna helix ( which remains unchanged ) to another dna helix , whose sequence is altered recombination can occur between dna sequences that contain no sequence homology b cells of the immune system perform genetic recombination , called immunoglobulin class switching in genetic engineering , recombination can also refer to artificial and deliberate recombination of disparate pieces of dna , often from different organisms , creating what is called recombinant dna in bacteria , transformation is a process of gene transfer that ordinarily occurs between individual cells of the same bacterial species pmid : 17166055 ; pmcid : pmc1657055 the nco/sdsa pathway contributes little to genetic variation , since the arms of the chromosomes flanking the recombination event remain in the parental configuration numerous rna viruses are capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell rna virus recombination occurs during reverse transcription and is mediated by the enzyme , reverse transcriptase determined that both recombination models are correct in hiv-1 recombination , and that recombination is necessary for viral replication recombination by rdrp strand switching also occurs in the ( + ) ssrna plant carmoviruses and tombusviruses

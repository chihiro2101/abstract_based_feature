the story of cain 's murder of abel and its consequences is told in : robert alter , trans the name '' cain '' , which means '' smith '' , resembles the verb translated as '' gotten '' but also possibly meaning '' to make '' and the human knew eve his woman and she conceived and bore cain , and she said , '' i have got me a man with the lord and she bore as well his brother abel , and abel became a herder of sheep while cain was a tiller of the soil and abel too had brought from the choice firstlings of his flock , and the lord regarded abel and his offering but did not regard cain and his offering and cain said to abel his brother , '' let us go out to the field , '' and when they were in the field cain rose against abel his brother and killed him '' and the lord said to cain , '' where is abel your brother ? and he said , '' i do not know : am i my brother 's keeper ? '' 4:10–12 – cain is cursed min-ha-adamah , from the earth , being the same root as '' man '' and adam '' and the lord said to him , '' therefore whoever kills cain shall suffer sevenfold vengeance cain ( qyn ) is thought to be cognate to the mid-1st millennium bce yemen word qyn , meaning 'metalsmith ' abel , the first murder victim , is sometimes seen as the first martyr ; while cain , the first murderer , is sometimes seen as an ancestor of evil cain and abel are symbolic rather than real a prominent mesopotamian parallel to cain and abel is the sumerian myth of the courtship of inanna and dumuzid , in which the shepherd dumuzid and the farmer enkimdu compete for the affection of the goddess inanna , with dumuzid ( the shepherd ) winning out the story appears in the quran 5:27-31 : the story of cain and abel has always been used as a deterrent from murder in islamic tradition muslim scholars were divided on the motives behind cain 's murder of abel , and further why the two brothers were obliged to offer sacrifices to god god accepted abel 's offering and rejected cain's—an indication that abel was more righteous than cain , and thus worthier of aclima after the murder , the devil hurried to eve shouting : '' eve ! cain has murdered abel ! '' this led some scholars , such as said ibn al-musayyib , to think that the sons of adam mentioned in the quran are actually two israelites , not cain and abel lord byron rewrote and dramatized the story in the play cain ( 1821 ) , viewing cain as symbolic of a four temperaments , provoked by abel 's hypocrisy and sanctimony john steinbeck 's 1952 novel east of eden ( also a 1955 film ) refers in its title to cain 's exile and contains discussions of the cain and abel story which then play out in the plot the danish stage play biblen ( 2008 ) discusses and reenacts various bible story , including abel 's murder by cain

the story of cain 's murder of abel and its consequences is told in : robert alter , trans the name '' cain '' , which means '' smith '' , resembles the verb translated as '' gotten '' but also possibly meaning '' to make '' '' 4:2 – abel 's name could be associated with '' vapor '' or '' puff of air '' and she bore as well his brother abel , and abel became a herder of sheep while cain was a tiller of the soil and it happened in the course of time that cain brought from the fruit of the soil an offering to the lord and abel too had brought from the choice firstlings of his flock , and the lord regarded abel and his offering but did not regard cain and his offering and cain said to abel his brother , '' let us go out to the field , '' and when they were in the field cain rose against abel his brother and killed him '' and the lord said to cain , '' where is abel your brother ? and he said , '' i do not know : am i my brother 's keeper ? '' 4:10–12 – cain is cursed min-ha-adamah , from the earth , being the same root as '' man '' and adam then he became the builder of a city and he called the name of the city like his son 's name , enoch abel ( hbl ) is thought to derive from a reconstructed word meaning 'herdsman ' , with the modern arabic cognate ibil now specifically referring only to 'camels ' this theory would make the names descriptive of their roles , where abel works with livestock , and cain with agriculture—and would parallel the names adam and eve another parallel is enlil chooses the farmer-god , in which the shepherd-god emesh and the farmer-god enten bring their dispute over which of them is better to the chief god enlil , who rules in favor of enten ( the farmer ) the story appears in the quran 5:27-31 : the story of cain and abel has always been used as a deterrent from murder in islamic tradition muslim scholars were divided on the motives behind cain 's murder of abel , and further why the two brothers were obliged to offer sacrifices to god but cain , a miserly farmer , offered only a bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him after the murder , the devil hurried to eve shouting : '' eve ! cain has murdered abel ! '' this led some scholars , such as said ibn al-musayyib , to think that the sons of adam mentioned in the quran are actually two israelites , not cain and abel the apocryphal life of adam and eve tells of eve having a dream in which cain drank his brother 's blood cain and abel have cain and abel ( comics ) since the 1950s the danish stage play biblen ( 2008 ) discusses and reenacts various bible story , including abel 's murder by cain

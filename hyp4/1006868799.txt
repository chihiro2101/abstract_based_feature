vocabulary is commonly defined as '' all the words known and used by a particular person '' words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person 's receptive vocabulary these words may range from well-known to barely known ( see degree of knowledge below ) a person 's receptive vocabulary is usually the larger of the two in this case , the child 's receptive vocabulary is likely tens , if not hundreds of words , but his or her active vocabulary is zero when that child learns to speak or sign , however , the child 's active vocabulary begins to increase it is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary , for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure , and can produce them , but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation productive vocabulary , therefore , generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer as with receptive vocabulary , however , there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary this simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person 's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt fluent with the word â€“ its use and definition there are many facets to knowing a word , some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by degree of knowledge several frameworks of word knowledge have been proposed to better operationalise this concept words can be defined in various ways , and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used the most common definition is that of a lemma ( the inflected or dictionary form ; this includes walk , but not walks , walked or walking ) another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family estimates of vocabulary size range from as high as 200 thousand to as low as 10 thousand , depending on the definition used a literate person 's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading this is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening a person 's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in speech those words are as far as he can go with language ; beyond them is only helpless passivity or a resort to force a lexicon , or vocabulary , is a language 's dictionary : its set of names for things , events , and ideas whether in one 's native language or a second language , the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process '' the key is in the keyword : l2 vocabulary learning methods with beginning learners of spanish '' if a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary , that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication

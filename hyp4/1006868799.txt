vocabulary is commonly defined as '' all the words known and used by a particular person '' words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person 's receptive vocabulary these words may range from well-known to barely known ( see degree of knowledge below ) a person 's receptive vocabulary is usually the larger of the two in this case , the child 's receptive vocabulary is likely tens , if not hundreds of words , but his or her active vocabulary is zero it is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary , for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure , and can produce them , but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation this simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person 's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt roughly , these stages could be described as : never encountered the word there are many facets to knowing a word , some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by degree of knowledge words can be defined in various ways , and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used , the words effortless , effortlessly , effortful , effortfully are all part of the word family effort ) this is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening a person 's listening vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when listening to speech a person 's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in speech this misuse , though slight and unintentional , may be compensated by facial expressions and tone of voice words are used in various forms of writing from formal essays to social media feeds those words are as far as he can go with language ; beyond them is only helpless passivity or a resort to force a lexicon , or vocabulary , is a language 's dictionary : its set of names for things , events , and ideas some linguists believe that lexicon influences people 's perception of things , the sapirâ€“whorf hypothesis this kind of comparison has elicited some linguistic controversy , as with the number of '' eskimo words for snow '' during its infancy , a granny instinctively builds a vocabulary this results in a wide range of vocabulary by age five or six , when an english-speaking child will have learned about 1500 words whether in one 's native language or a second language , the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process one useful method of building vocabulary in a second language is the keyword method in addition , studies have shown that associative vocabulary learning is more successful with younger students ( sagarra and alba , 2006 ) several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication

vocabulary is commonly defined as '' all the words known and used by a particular person '' words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person 's receptive vocabulary these words may range from well-known to barely known ( see degree of knowledge below ) in this case , the child 's receptive vocabulary is likely tens , if not hundreds of words , but his or her active vocabulary is zero it is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary , for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure , and can produce them , but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation productive vocabulary , therefore , generally refers to words that can be produced within an appropriate context and match the intended meaning of the speaker or signer as with receptive vocabulary , however , there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary within the receptiveâ€“productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as degree of knowledge this simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person 's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt there are many facets to knowing a word , some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by degree of knowledge the most common definition is that of a lemma ( the inflected or dictionary form ; this includes walk , but not walks , walked or walking ) another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family brysbaert m , stevens m , mandera p and keuleers e ( 2016 ) how many words do we know ? practical estimates of vocabulary size dependent on word definition , the degree of language input and the participant 's age a literate person 's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading this is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening a person 's listening vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when listening to speech people may still understand words they were not exposed to before using cues such as tone , gestures , the topic of discussion and the social context of the conversation a person 's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in speech for example , if there are a number of synonyms , a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use , and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest the nuer have dozens of names for cattle because of the cattle 's particular histories , economies , and environments english speakers with relevant specialised knowledge can also display elaborate and precise vocabularies for snow and cattle when the need arises . the effects of vocabulary size on language comprehension vocabulary learning is one of the first steps in learning a second language , but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition a neural network model of novel word learning across orthographies , accounting for l1-specific memorization abilities of l2-learners has recently been introduced ( hadzibeganovic and cannas , 2009 ) several word lists have been developed to provide people with a limited vocabulary either for the purpose of rapid language proficiency or for effective communication as a result word definitions in such dictionaries can be understood even by learners with a limited vocabulary

vocabulary is commonly defined as '' all the words known and used by a particular person '' words that are generally understood when heard or read or seen constitute a person 's receptive vocabulary these words may range from well-known to barely known ( see degree of knowledge below ) for example , although a young child may not yet be able to speak , write , or sign , he or she may be able to follow simple commands and appear to understand a good portion of the language to which they are exposed in this case , the child 's receptive vocabulary is likely tens , if not hundreds of words , but his or her active vocabulary is zero when that child learns to speak or sign , however , the child 's active vocabulary begins to increase it is also possible for the productive vocabulary to be larger than the receptive vocabulary , for example in a second-language learner who has learned words through study rather than exposure , and can produce them , but has difficulty recognizing them in conversation as with receptive vocabulary , however , there are many degrees at which a particular word may be considered part of an active vocabulary knowing how to pronounce , sign , or write a word does not necessarily mean that the word that has been used correctly or accurately reflects the intended message ; but it does reflect a minimal amount of productive knowledge within the receptive–productive distinction lies a range of abilities that are often referred to as degree of knowledge this simply indicates that a word gradually enters a person 's vocabulary over a period of time as more aspects of word knowledge are learnt fluent with the word – its use and definition there are many facets to knowing a word , some of which are not hierarchical so their acquisition does not necessarily follow a linear progression suggested by degree of knowledge words can be defined in various ways , and estimates of vocabulary size differ depending on the definition used another definition often used in research of vocabulary size is that of word family a literate person 's vocabulary is all the words they can recognize when reading this is generally the largest type of vocabulary simply because a reader tends to be exposed to more words by reading than by listening people may still understand words they were not exposed to before using cues such as tone , gestures , the topic of discussion and the social context of the conversation a person 's speaking vocabulary is all the words they use in speech words are used in various forms of writing from formal essays to social media feeds for example , if there are a number of synonyms , a writer may have a preference as to which of them to use , and they are unlikely to use technical vocabulary relating to a subject in which they have no knowledge or interest vocabulary learning is one of the first steps in learning a second language , but a learner never finishes vocabulary acquisition whether in one 's native language or a second language , the acquisition of new vocabulary is an ongoing process if a second language learner relies solely on word associations to learn new vocabulary , that person will have a very difficult time mastering false friends if time is available or one wants to emphasize a few key words , one can create mnemonic devices or word associations these include basic english ( 850 words ) , special english ( 1,500 words ) , general service list ( 2,000 words ) , and academic word list

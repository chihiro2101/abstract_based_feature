bird jaguar in the early 5th century fought against k'inich tatb ' u skull i in yaxchilan , and lost his freedom other nobles were captured in a later war against knot-eye jaguar i 422 giving bonampak some respite ; but after 526 , his successor k'inich tatb ' u skull ii attacked bonampak again and captured more lords in that time , the ajaw of yaxchilan installed yajaw chan muwaan i as lord in bonampak although there is no evidence to support the claim , some speculate that it may have also had a roofcomb , such as can be seen on structure 33 at nearby yaxchilan structurally symmetrical , balanced and stable , it is composed of three separate rooms , which contain murals that narrate the events surrounding the accession to the throne by chooj , son of bonampak ruler yajaw chaan muwan , and grandson of aj sak teles the planning and execution of the bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists , and not to one solitary genius the exterior of structure 1 , although poorly preserved , was once richly painted in bright hues of maya blue , blue-green , red , and yellow indeed , almost everything would have been covered in paint , as even the floors in each room were painted black on the east and west sides of the building , the upper course featured additional seated figures within niches set atop long-snouted god heads—these still have some remnants of red paint visible lintel 1 ( room 1 ) depicts yajaw chaan muwan , ruler of bonampak , capturing an enemy on january 12 , a.d thus , it is clear that no maya noble in full regalia would have ever entered these rooms without a bow of deferential respect in 1996 , a team from yale university led by professor mary miller began the bonampak documentation project , which included making an even more detailed study , photographic record , and reproductions of the murals note : the numbered human figures ( hf ) mentioned below can be found in the aforementioned publication on page 73 , in addition to excellent large foldouts in the back of the book there are 77 human figures in this first room fulfilling various functions within the narrative some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall ( hf 's 62 , 63 , and 64 ) it was at first thought that the central figure ( hf 63 ) was the ruler of bonampak , yajaw chaan muwan however , further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler , chooj , who is in between his two brothers : bird balam and aj balam of particular note is hf 71 , standing in a familiar pose to smokers of today , as he , too , embraces a long , thin cigarette , expressing some combination of calm , lack of interest and boredom behind him , hf 's 73 and 74 , as well as hf 's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together , holding parasols that frame the initial series text right above them on the middle register on the lower register of the north wall , still more musicians ( hf 's 43 and 44 ) blast their trumpets , while other performers ( hf 's 45–50 ) wear various costumes , including that of a crocodile ( hf 48 ) conspicuously placed upon a raised platform on the upper register of the south wall , just above two holes where wooden beams had once ran through to help support the structure , stands a lone figure ( hf 16 ) presenting a child ( hf 15 ) to the lords in fact , he is glancing over his left shoulder into the upper register of the west wall at the figure ( hf 19 ) sitting upon an elevated throne therefore , the identification of hf 19 as yajaw chaan muwan is deduced rather than known unequivocally based on a name glyph “ kakaw ” was the classic maya term for the cacao bean , and harvard university professor david stuart has suggested that the “ pi ” glyph represents units of 8,000 beans the south wall , which is the first that is viewed upon entering , along with the east and the west walls , depict warriors in the heat of battle nude and almost nude captives ( only wearing a loin cloth ) are depicted in deep agony , as some of them are in the process of getting their fingernails ripped off , or have already undergone this torture and bleed from their wounds ( hf 's 101–109 ) however , the infrared images revealed that what hf 22 had in his left hand was none other than the still beating heart of the sacrificial victim below ( hf 19 ) , who is being dragged down the pyramid steps by two attendants ( hf 's 18 and 20 ) above the entire south wall scene , set among a background of yellow —the first appearance of a color not representing reality — is a supernatural entity with square eyes , and a single frontal , pointed tooth professor mary miller wrote , '' perhaps no single artifact from the ancient new world offers as complex a view of prehispanic society as do the bonampak paintings 21 , 1949 - article about bonampak proyecto la pintura mural prehispánica en méxico , unam yale bonampak documentation project bonampak murals on ancientmexico.com - good large photographs of the originals mesoamerican photo archives by david r

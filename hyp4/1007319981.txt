from 1993 to 1997 , the mexican national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) excavated at bonampak , discovering 27 burials other nobles were captured in a later war against knot-eye jaguar i 422 giving bonampak some respite ; but after 526 , his successor k'inich tatb ' u skull ii attacked bonampak again and captured more lords 790 ce , yaxchilan 's king shield jaguar iii oversaw the installation of chan muwaan ii , and hired yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it in '' structure i '' 's murals although there is no evidence to support the claim , some speculate that it may have also had a roofcomb , such as can be seen on structure 33 at nearby yaxchilan in total , there are some 281 human figures represented within the three rooms , many with captions ( approximately 1/3 of the figures are named , while another 10 percent of the figures have blank captions , and slightly more than half have no caption at all ) a few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment , an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible lowland maya collapse during the period of structure 1 's creation , and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures the planning and execution of the bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists , and not to one solitary genius essentially , the artists at bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of structure 1 as if it were a maya vase ; more specifically , this was done in the codex-style vases of the petén , and not mirroring those of the usumacinta region where bonampak is located hinting at what is depicted within on the murals , the image depicts a figure in a forward stride toward a captive on his knees before him , his hair being gripped firmly by his vanquisher lintel 1 ( room 1 ) depicts yajaw chaan muwan , ruler of bonampak , capturing an enemy on january 12 , a.d 787 ( longcount date : 9.17.16.3.12 , 8 eb 10 k ’ umk ’ u ) ; lintel 2 ( room 2 ) likely shows the overlord from yaxchilan , shield jaguar iv , on january 4 , a.d 787 ( longcount date : 9.17.16.3.8 , 4 lamat 6 k ’ umk ’ u ) ; and lintel 3 ( room 3 ) displays aj sak teles , probably on july 25 , a.d thus , it is clear that no maya noble in full regalia would have ever entered these rooms without a bow of deferential respect room 1 : thumbthis is the scene of a regal event : the acknowledgement , in front of the court and visiting dignitaries , by the bonampak ruler , yajaw chaan muwan , of his son 's right to rule some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall ( hf 's 62 , 63 , and 64 ) however , further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler , chooj , who is in between his two brothers : bird balam and aj balam to the viewer 's left of hf 62 , beginning on the south wall and leading to the east wall , there are several figures playing instruments ( rattles , drums , and turtle shells ) and singing , which fill this room with celebratory music behind him , hf 's 73 and 74 , as well as hf 's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together , holding parasols that frame the initial series text right above them on the middle register at first , many thought that this child was the young heir ; however , as noted previously , the central dancing figure below ( hf 63 ) was the heir to the throne at bonampak yet , even without having decoded the glyphs next to the three festive brothers , one notices a couple of peculiarities it is important to mention here that the caption above this individual , like so many captions in structure 1 , was left blank therefore , the identification of hf 19 as yajaw chaan muwan is deduced rather than known unequivocally based on a name glyph room 2 : this is the scene of what has been referred to as the greatest battle scene in all of maya art yajaw chan muwaan is the main figure here , too , wearing only a slightly different variant of his battle costume from the south wall the last two items—perforated vase and a stone knife—lead some to believe that this individual was one of the sacrifice victims depicted in room 2 room 3 : alt this is the scene of ritual celebration for victory in battle , including bloodletting by nobles , and contains 65 human figures the upper register of the east wall shows the noble women of bonampak ( hf 's 2 , 5 and 6 ) holding stingray spines to their tongues in a bloodletting ritual of note is the fact that these individuals also seem to appear previously—hf 7 in room 2 on the middle of the east wall ; the others in room 1 on the west wall throne scene no other work features so many maya engaged in the life of the court and rendered in such great detail , making the bonampak murals an unparalleled resource for understanding ancient society 21 , 1949 - article about bonampak proyecto la pintura mural prehispánica en méxico , unam yale bonampak documentation project bonampak murals on ancientmexico.com - good large photographs of the originals mesoamerican photo archives by david r

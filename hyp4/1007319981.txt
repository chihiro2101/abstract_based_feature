from 1993 to 1997 , the mexican national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) excavated at bonampak , discovering 27 burials bird jaguar in the early 5th century fought against k'inich tatb ' u skull i in yaxchilan , and lost his freedom 422 giving bonampak some respite ; but after 526 , his successor k'inich tatb ' u skull ii attacked bonampak again and captured more lords in that time , the ajaw of yaxchilan installed yajaw chan muwaan i as lord in bonampak subsequent ajawob reconstructed the site to orient toward the metropolis 790 ce , yaxchilan 's king shield jaguar iii oversaw the installation of chan muwaan ii , and hired yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it in '' structure i '' 's murals structurally symmetrical , balanced and stable , it is composed of three separate rooms , which contain murals that narrate the events surrounding the accession to the throne by chooj , son of bonampak ruler yajaw chaan muwan , and grandson of aj sak teles a few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment , an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible lowland maya collapse during the period of structure 1 's creation , and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures the planning and execution of the bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists , and not to one solitary genius indeed , almost everything would have been covered in paint , as even the floors in each room were painted black essentially , the artists at bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of structure 1 as if it were a maya vase ; more specifically , this was done in the codex-style vases of the petén , and not mirroring those of the usumacinta region where bonampak is located between these niches there were two larger stucco scenes , only one of which has survived the ravages of time hinting at what is depicted within on the murals , the image depicts a figure in a forward stride toward a captive on his knees before him , his hair being gripped firmly by his vanquisher lintel 1 ( room 1 ) depicts yajaw chaan muwan , ruler of bonampak , capturing an enemy on january 12 , a.d 787 ( longcount date : 9.17.16.3.12 , 8 eb 10 k ’ umk ’ u ) ; lintel 2 ( room 2 ) likely shows the overlord from yaxchilan , shield jaguar iv , on january 4 , a.d note : the numbered human figures ( hf ) mentioned below can be found in the aforementioned publication on page 73 , in addition to excellent large foldouts in the back of the book room 1 : thumbthis is the scene of a regal event : the acknowledgement , in front of the court and visiting dignitaries , by the bonampak ruler , yajaw chaan muwan , of his son 's right to rule the large , feathered back racks , in addition to the various jaguar , quetzal and serpent elements in their costumes , underscore the importance of these figures it was at first thought that the central figure ( hf 63 ) was the ruler of bonampak , yajaw chaan muwan however , further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler , chooj , who is in between his two brothers : bird balam and aj balam behind him , hf 's 73 and 74 , as well as hf 's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together , holding parasols that frame the initial series text right above them on the middle register on the lower register of the north wall , still more musicians ( hf 's 43 and 44 ) blast their trumpets , while other performers ( hf 's 45–50 ) wear various costumes , including that of a crocodile ( hf 48 ) in fact , he is glancing over his left shoulder into the upper register of the west wall at the figure ( hf 19 ) sitting upon an elevated throne therefore , the identification of hf 19 as yajaw chaan muwan is deduced rather than known unequivocally based on a name glyph it was not until professor mary miller 's aforementioned bonampak documentation project that scholars finally knew what these bundles contained after analyzing infrared images of this scene , glyphs for “ 5 pi kakaw ” were revealed “ kakaw ” was the classic maya term for the cacao bean , and harvard university professor david stuart has suggested that the “ pi ” glyph represents units of 8,000 beans as one turns to view the north wall , the viewer is greeted by the sequel to the battle : torture and sacrifice of the captives taken in battle right below chooj is another figure ( hf 22 ) on his knees ; he is also holding an ax in his right hand and another object in his left the upper register of the east wall shows the noble women of bonampak ( hf 's 2 , 5 and 6 ) holding stingray spines to their tongues in a bloodletting ritual no other work features so many maya engaged in the life of the court and rendered in such great detail , making the bonampak murals an unparalleled resource for understanding ancient society

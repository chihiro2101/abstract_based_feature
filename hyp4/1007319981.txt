from 1993 to 1997 , the mexican national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) excavated at bonampak , discovering 27 burials bird jaguar in the early 5th century fought against k'inich tatb ' u skull i in yaxchilan , and lost his freedom in 514 , knot-eye jaguar i was himself taken captive ( by ruler c of piedras negras ) , sharer & traxler 2006 , p 422 giving bonampak some respite ; but after 526 , his successor k'inich tatb ' u skull ii attacked bonampak again and captured more lords thumbstructure 1 : structure 1 at bonampak , built at the end of the eighth century a.d although there is no evidence to support the claim , some speculate that it may have also had a roofcomb , such as can be seen on structure 33 at nearby yaxchilan structurally symmetrical , balanced and stable , it is composed of three separate rooms , which contain murals that narrate the events surrounding the accession to the throne by chooj , son of bonampak ruler yajaw chaan muwan , and grandson of aj sak teles a few theories as to why some captions were left blank include deaths or political realignment , an interruption of the murals related to the ostensible lowland maya collapse during the period of structure 1 's creation , and the possibility that it became politically impolite to name certain figures the planning and execution of the bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists , and not to one solitary genius the exterior of structure 1 , although poorly preserved , was once richly painted in bright hues of maya blue , blue-green , red , and yellow essentially , the artists at bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of structure 1 as if it were a maya vase ; more specifically , this was done in the codex-style vases of the petén , and not mirroring those of the usumacinta region where bonampak is located hinting at what is depicted within on the murals , the image depicts a figure in a forward stride toward a captive on his knees before him , his hair being gripped firmly by his vanquisher on the east and west sides of the building , the upper course featured additional seated figures within niches set atop long-snouted god heads—these still have some remnants of red paint visible lintel 1 ( room 1 ) depicts yajaw chaan muwan , ruler of bonampak , capturing an enemy on january 12 , a.d in 1996 , a team from yale university led by professor mary miller began the bonampak documentation project , which included making an even more detailed study , photographic record , and reproductions of the murals most saliently , the images captured many glyphs that were previously unknown , lost either to natural erosion , or due to the many failed attempts at preservation , some of which did far more damage than conservation there are 77 human figures in this first room fulfilling various functions within the narrative some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall ( hf 's 62 , 63 , and 64 ) it was at first thought that the central figure ( hf 63 ) was the ruler of bonampak , yajaw chaan muwan however , further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler , chooj , who is in between his two brothers : bird balam and aj balam with heels raised , all three brothers are in the middle of a ritual dance of particular note is hf 71 , standing in a familiar pose to smokers of today , as he , too , embraces a long , thin cigarette , expressing some combination of calm , lack of interest and boredom behind him , hf 's 73 and 74 , as well as hf 's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together , holding parasols that frame the initial series text right above them on the middle register on the lower register of the north wall , still more musicians ( hf 's 43 and 44 ) blast their trumpets , while other performers ( hf 's 45–50 ) wear various costumes , including that of a crocodile ( hf 48 ) conspicuously placed upon a raised platform on the upper register of the south wall , just above two holes where wooden beams had once ran through to help support the structure , stands a lone figure ( hf 16 ) presenting a child ( hf 15 ) to the lords at first , many thought that this child was the young heir ; however , as noted previously , the central dancing figure below ( hf 63 ) was the heir to the throne at bonampak as one turns to view the north wall , the viewer is greeted by the sequel to the battle : torture and sacrifice of the captives taken in battle the skeleton was accompanied by jade earrings , a jade necklace and bracelets , a spondylus shell pendant , two polychrome plates , an alabaster vase with a hole in the base , and a stone knife covering almost the entire bottom register of the south and west walls are seven more elaborately costumed characters ( hf 's 13 , 15 , 17 , 26 , 26 , 27 and 28 ) with similar headdresses to those of the brothers above them the upper register of the east wall shows the noble women of bonampak ( hf 's 2 , 5 and 6 ) holding stingray spines to their tongues in a bloodletting ritual of note is the fact that these individuals also seem to appear previously—hf 7 in room 2 on the middle of the east wall ; the others in room 1 on the west wall throne scene

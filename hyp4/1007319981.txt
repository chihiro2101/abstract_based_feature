from 1993 to 1997 , the mexican national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) excavated at bonampak , discovering 27 burials bird jaguar in the early 5th century fought against k'inich tatb ' u skull i in yaxchilan , and lost his freedom 422 giving bonampak some respite ; but after 526 , his successor k'inich tatb ' u skull ii attacked bonampak again and captured more lords bonampak by 600 ce had become a satellite of yaxchilan subsequent ajawob reconstructed the site to orient toward the metropolis 790 ce , yaxchilan 's king shield jaguar iii oversaw the installation of chan muwaan ii , and hired yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it in '' structure i '' 's murals thumbstructure 1 : structure 1 at bonampak , built at the end of the eighth century a.d although there is no evidence to support the claim , some speculate that it may have also had a roofcomb , such as can be seen on structure 33 at nearby yaxchilan the planning and execution of the bonampak murals points to a large team of specialists , and not to one solitary genius this team would have included plasterers , pigment preparers , and possibly calligraphers , in addition to the painters and planners whose artistic conception is most visible on the walls the exterior of structure 1 , although poorly preserved , was once richly painted in bright hues of maya blue , blue-green , red , and yellow essentially , the artists at bonampak framed the lower course of the exterior of structure 1 as if it were a maya vase ; more specifically , this was done in the codex-style vases of the petén , and not mirroring those of the usumacinta region where bonampak is located between these niches there were two larger stucco scenes , only one of which has survived the ravages of time lintel 1 ( room 1 ) depicts yajaw chaan muwan , ruler of bonampak , capturing an enemy on january 12 , a.d 787 ( longcount date : 9.17.16.3.12 , 8 eb 10 k ’ umk ’ u ) ; lintel 2 ( room 2 ) likely shows the overlord from yaxchilan , shield jaguar iv , on january 4 , a.d thus , it is clear that no maya noble in full regalia would have ever entered these rooms without a bow of deferential respect in 1996 , a team from yale university led by professor mary miller began the bonampak documentation project , which included making an even more detailed study , photographic record , and reproductions of the murals there are 77 human figures in this first room fulfilling various functions within the narrative some of the actors that capture immediate attention are the elegantly costumed figures on the lower register of the south wall ( hf 's 62 , 63 , and 64 ) it was at first thought that the central figure ( hf 63 ) was the ruler of bonampak , yajaw chaan muwan however , further readings of the accompanying glyphs show this figure to be the future ruler , chooj , who is in between his two brothers : bird balam and aj balam with heels raised , all three brothers are in the middle of a ritual dance to the viewer 's right of the three ch ’ oks , leading to the west wall , there are eight ( regional governors ) behind him , hf 's 73 and 74 , as well as hf 's 52 and 54 on the east wall work together , holding parasols that frame the initial series text right above them on the middle register on the lower register of the north wall , still more musicians ( hf 's 43 and 44 ) blast their trumpets , while other performers ( hf 's 45–50 ) wear various costumes , including that of a crocodile ( hf 48 ) at first , many thought that this child was the young heir ; however , as noted previously , the central dancing figure below ( hf 63 ) was the heir to the throne at bonampak in fact , he is glancing over his left shoulder into the upper register of the west wall at the figure ( hf 19 ) sitting upon an elevated throne it was not until professor mary miller 's aforementioned bonampak documentation project that scholars finally knew what these bundles contained the south wall , which is the first that is viewed upon entering , along with the east and the west walls , depict warriors in the heat of battle that is , no one intending to win would enter battle wearing costumes related to defeat , nor would all of the warriors of the losing side be left-handed no other work features so many maya engaged in the life of the court and rendered in such great detail , making the bonampak murals an unparalleled resource for understanding ancient society

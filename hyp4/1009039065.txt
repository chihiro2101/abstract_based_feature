his father , hermann kandel , was born in 1898 in olesko , galicia ( then part of austria-hungary ) eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents he attended brooklyn 's erasmus hall high school in the new york city school system kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation so i went instead to erasmus hall high school , a local public high school in brooklyn that was then academically very strong sigmund freud , a pioneer in revealing the importance of unconscious neural processes , was at the root of kandel 's interest in the biology of motivation and unconscious and conscious memory during this time he met his future wife , denise kandel kandel was first exposed to research in harry grundfest 's laboratory at columbia university the researchers kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of intracellular recordings of the electrical activity of the relatively small neurons of the vertebrate brain karl lashley , a well-known american neuropsychologist , had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain the team also noticed the spontaneous pacemaker-like activity of these neurons , as well as a robust recurrent inhibition in the hippocampus but , with respect to memory , there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the synapse connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage this decision was not without risk : many senior biologists and psychologists believed that nothing useful could be learned about human memory by studying invertebrate physiology faculty member at new york university medical school '' kandel 's winning of the 2000 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was a result of his work with aplysia on the biological mechanisms of memory storage in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior thus , short-term memory had been linked to functional changes in existing synapses , while long-term memory was associated with a change in the number of synaptic connections tom carew 1970â€“1983 : professor and dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at new york university , center for neural science nobel prize winner kandel speaks of brain , snails , memory pill , bloomberg april 7 , 2006 interview with kandel june 2006 in german eric kandel 's faculty profile in the department of psychiatry at columbia university eric kandel 's columbia university website finding aid to the eric kandel papers at columbia university

eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation so i went instead to erasmus hall high school , a local public high school in brooklyn that was then academically very strong he wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on '' the attitude toward national socialism of three german writers : carl zuckmayer , hans carossa , and ernst jünger '' the world of neuroscience was opened up to kandel when he met anna kris , whose parents ernst kris and marianne rie were psychoanalysts after starting his neurobiological work in the difficult thicket of the electrophysiology of the cerebral cortex , kandel was impressed by the progress that had been made by stephen kuffler using a much more experimentally accessible system : neurons isolated from marine invertebrates after becoming aware of kuffler 's work in 1955 , kandel graduated from medical school and learned from stanley crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons karl lashley , a well-known american neuropsychologist , had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain when kandel joined the laboratory of neurophysiology at the us national institutes of health in 1957 , william beecher scoville and brenda milner had recently described the patient hm , who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his hippocampus but , with respect to memory , there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior , such as those by konrad lorenz , niko tinbergen , and karl von frisch had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage in 1962 , after completing his residency in psychiatry , kandel went to paris to learn about the marine mollusk aplysia californica from ladislav tauc faculty member at new york university medical school kandel took a position in the departments of physiology and psychiatry at the new york university medical school , eventually forming the division of neurobiology and behavior in particular , the researchers showed that the now famous gill-withdrawal reflex , by which the slug protects its tender gill tissue from danger , was sensitive to both habituation and sensitization in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior it was soon found that the neurotransmitter serotonin , acting to produce the second messenger camp , is involved in the molecular basis of sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex first published in 1981 and now in its fifth edition , principles of neural science is often used as a teaching and reference text in medical schools and undergraduate and graduate programs ( jack ) byrne 1970–1975 : professor and director of the neuroscience research center at ut health science center ( mcgovern medical school ) ; founder and editor of the research journal learning and memory nobel prize winner kandel speaks of brain , snails , memory pill , bloomberg april 7 , 2006 interview with kandel june 2006 in german eric kandel 's faculty profile in the department of psychiatry at columbia university eric kandel 's columbia university website finding aid to the eric kandel papers at columbia university

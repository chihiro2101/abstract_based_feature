eric 's mother , charlotte zimels , was born in 1897 in kolomyia , pokuttya ( modern ukraine ) his father , hermann kandel , was born in 1898 in olesko , galicia ( then part of austria-hungary ) eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna he attended brooklyn 's erasmus hall high school in the new york city school system kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation skinner , kandel became interested in learning and memory however , while skinner championed a strict separation of psychology , as its own level of discourse , from biological considerations such as neurology , kandel 's work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology kandel was first exposed to research in harry grundfest 's laboratory at columbia university after starting his neurobiological work in the difficult thicket of the electrophysiology of the cerebral cortex , kandel was impressed by the progress that had been made by stephen kuffler using a much more experimentally accessible system : neurons isolated from marine invertebrates after becoming aware of kuffler 's work in 1955 , kandel graduated from medical school and learned from stanley crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons karl lashley , a well-known american neuropsychologist , had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain kandel took on the task of performing electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal pyramidal neurons kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage kandel took a position in the departments of physiology and psychiatry at the new york university medical school , eventually forming the division of neurobiology and behavior in particular , the researchers showed that the now famous gill-withdrawal reflex , by which the slug protects its tender gill tissue from danger , was sensitive to both habituation and sensitization by 1971 tom carew had joined the research group and helped extend the work from studies restricted to short-term memory to experiments that included physiological processes required for long-term memory '' kandel 's winning of the 2000 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was a result of his work with aplysia on the biological mechanisms of memory storage in collaboration with david glanzman and craig bailey , kandel identified creb as being a protein involved in long-term memory storage since 1974 , kandel actively contributes to science as a member of the division of neurobiology and behavior at the department of psychiatry at columbia university tom carew 1970–1983 : professor and dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at new york university , center for neural science walters 1974–1980 : professor at the medical school of the university of texas health science center at houston kandel 's 2012 book , the age of insight—as expressed in its subtitle , the quest to understand the unconscious in art , mind , and brain , from vienna 1900 to the present —represents a wide-ranging historical attempt to place vienna at the root of cultural modernism interview with kandel june 2006 in german eric kandel 's faculty profile in the department of psychiatry at columbia university eric kandel 's columbia university website finding aid to the eric kandel papers at columbia university

eric 's mother , charlotte zimels , was born in 1897 in kolomyia , pokuttya ( modern ukraine ) eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents after arriving in the united states and settling in brooklyn , kandel was tutored by his grandfather in judaic studies and was accepted at the yeshiva of flatbush , from which he graduated in 1944 he attended brooklyn 's erasmus hall high school in the new york city school system kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation he wrote an undergraduate honors thesis on '' the attitude toward national socialism of three german writers : carl zuckmayer , hans carossa , and ernst jünger '' however , while skinner championed a strict separation of psychology , as its own level of discourse , from biological considerations such as neurology , kandel 's work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology medical school and early research kandel was first exposed to research in harry grundfest 's laboratory at columbia university after becoming aware of kuffler 's work in 1955 , kandel graduated from medical school and learned from stanley crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons karl lashley , a well-known american neuropsychologist , had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain kandel took on the task of performing electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal pyramidal neurons but , with respect to memory , there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the synapse connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior , such as those by konrad lorenz , niko tinbergen , and karl von frisch had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage faculty member at new york university medical school kandel took a position in the departments of physiology and psychiatry at the new york university medical school , eventually forming the division of neurobiology and behavior by this time it was known that long-term memory , unlike short-term memory , involved the synthesis of new proteins ( jack ) byrne 1970–1975 : professor and director of the neuroscience research center at ut health science center ( mcgovern medical school ) ; founder and editor of the research journal learning and memory walters 1974–1980 : professor at the medical school of the university of texas health science center at houston interview with kandel june 2006 in german eric kandel 's faculty profile in the department of psychiatry at columbia university eric kandel 's columbia university website finding aid to the eric kandel papers at columbia university

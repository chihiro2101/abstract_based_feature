eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents he attended brooklyn 's erasmus hall high school in the new york city school system kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation skinner , kandel became interested in learning and memory however , while skinner championed a strict separation of psychology , as its own level of discourse , from biological considerations such as neurology , kandel 's work is essentially centered on an explanation of the relationships between psychology and neurology grundfest was known for using the oscilloscope to demonstrate that action potential conduction velocity depends on axon diameter the researchers kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of intracellular recordings of the electrical activity of the relatively small neurons of the vertebrate brain after starting his neurobiological work in the difficult thicket of the electrophysiology of the cerebral cortex , kandel was impressed by the progress that had been made by stephen kuffler using a much more experimentally accessible system : neurons isolated from marine invertebrates after becoming aware of kuffler 's work in 1955 , kandel graduated from medical school and learned from stanley crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons when kandel joined the laboratory of neurophysiology at the us national institutes of health in 1957 , william beecher scoville and brenda milner had recently described the patient hm , who had lost the ability to form new memories after removal of his hippocampus they provided the first intracellular records of the electrical activity that underlies the epilepsy spike ( the intracellular paroxysmal depolarizing shift ) and the epileptic runs of spikes ( the intracellular sustained depolarization ) but , with respect to memory , there was nothing in the general electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons that suggested why the hippocampus was special for explicit memory storage kandel began to realize that memory storage must rely on modifications in the synapse connections between neurons and that the complex connectivity of the hippocampus did not provide the best system for study of the detailed function of synapses kandel was aware that comparative studies of behavior , such as those by konrad lorenz , niko tinbergen , and karl von frisch had revealed that simple forms of learning were found even in very simple animals kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage the results from kandel 's laboratory provided solid evidence for the mechanistic basis of learning as '' a change in the functional effectiveness of previously existing excitatory connections in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior since 1974 , kandel actively contributes to science as a member of the division of neurobiology and behavior at the department of psychiatry at columbia university ( jack ) byrne 1970–1975 : professor and director of the neuroscience research center at ut health science center ( mcgovern medical school ) ; founder and editor of the research journal learning and memory kelsey martin 1992-1999 : dean of the david geffen school of medicine at ucla and professor in the departments of biological chemistry , psychiatry , and biobehavioral sciences interview with kandel june 2006 in german eric kandel 's faculty profile in the department of psychiatry at columbia university eric kandel 's columbia university website finding aid to the eric kandel papers at columbia university rare book & manuscript library science friday : october 13 , 2000 npr interview eric kandel – a nobel 's life eric r

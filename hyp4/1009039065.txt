his father , hermann kandel , was born in 1898 in olesko , galicia ( then part of austria-hungary ) at the beginning of world war & nbsp ; i , his parents moved to vienna , austria , where they met and married in 1923 eric kandel was born on november 7 , 1929 , in vienna when eric was 9 , he and his brother ludwig , 14 , boarded the gerolstein at antwerp , belgium , and joined their uncle in brooklyn on may 11 , 1939 , to be followed later by his parents after arriving in the united states and settling in brooklyn , kandel was tutored by his grandfather in judaic studies and was accepted at the yeshiva of flatbush , from which he graduated in 1944 he attended brooklyn 's erasmus hall high school in the new york city school system kandel : the nobel prize in physiology or medicine 2000 , nobel foundation the researchers kandel interacted with were contemplating the technical challenges of intracellular recordings of the electrical activity of the relatively small neurons of the vertebrate brain after starting his neurobiological work in the difficult thicket of the electrophysiology of the cerebral cortex , kandel was impressed by the progress that had been made by stephen kuffler using a much more experimentally accessible system : neurons isolated from marine invertebrates after becoming aware of kuffler 's work in 1955 , kandel graduated from medical school and learned from stanley crain how to make microelectrodes that could be used for intracellular recordings of crayfish giant axons karl lashley , a well-known american neuropsychologist , had tried but failed to identify an anatomical locus for memory storage in the cortex of the brain kandel felt it would be productive to select a simple animal model that would facilitate electrophysiological analysis of the synaptic changes involved in learning and memory storage kandel had realized that simple forms of learning such as habituation , sensitization , classical conditioning , and operant conditioning could readily be studied with ganglia isolated from aplysia kandel took a position in the departments of physiology and psychiatry at the new york university medical school , eventually forming the division of neurobiology and behavior along with the fundamental behavioral studies , other work in the lab traced the neuronal circuits of sensory neurons , interneurons , and motor neurons involved in the learned behaviors '' kandel 's winning of the 2000 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was a result of his work with aplysia on the biological mechanisms of memory storage starting in 1966 james schwartz collaborated with kandel on a biochemical analysis of changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage by this time it was known that long-term memory , unlike short-term memory , involved the synthesis of new proteins in 1974 kandel moved his lab to columbia university and became founding director of the center for neurobiology and behavior in 1983 kandel helped form the howard hughes medical institute at columbia devoted to molecular neural science kandel has been a member of the national academy of sciences since 1974 nobel prize winner kandel speaks of brain , snails , memory pill , bloomberg april 7 , 2006 interview with kandel june 2006 in german eric kandel 's faculty profile in the department of psychiatry at columbia university eric kandel 's columbia university website finding aid to the eric kandel papers at columbia university

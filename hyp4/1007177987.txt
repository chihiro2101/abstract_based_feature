abu al-hasan al-ashʿari was noted for his teachings on atomism , ash'ari - a history of muslim philosophy among the earliest islamic philosophy , and for al-ashʿari this was the basis for propagating the view that god created every moment in time and every particle of matter while al-ashʿari opposed the views of the rival mu'tazili school , he was also opposed to the view which bi-la kaifa , held by certain schools such as the zahiri ( '' literalist '' ) , mujassimite ( '' anthropotheism '' ) and muhaddithin ( '' traditionalist '' ) schools for their over-emphasis on taqlid ( imitation ) in his istihsan al‑khaud : m ashʿarism became the main school of early islamic philosophy whereby it was originally based on the foundations laid down by abu al-hasan al-ashʿari who founded the school in the 10th century based on the methodology taught to him by his teacher abdullah ibn sa'eed ibn kullaab however , the school underwent many changes throughout history resulting in the term ashʿari , in modern usage , being extremely broad , e.g the solution proposed by abu al-hasan al-ashʿari to solve the problems of tashbih and ta'til concedes that the divine being possesses in a real sense the attributes and names mentioned in the quran the inspiration of al-ashʿari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts , and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level — something which mu'tazili thinking had failed to grasp intellectual inquiry is decreed by the qur'an and by muhammad , thus interpretations of the quran ( tafsir ) and the hadith should keep developing with the aid of older interpretations muslims must believe in the five pillars of islam ; abdullah saeed islamic thought : an introduction routledge 2006 chapter 5 in all the prophets in islam from adam to muhammad ; and in angels like other ashʿarites who believed that faith or taqlid should apply only to islam and not to any ancient hellenistic authorities , ibn al-haytham 's view that taqlid should apply only to prophets of islam and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his scientific skepticism and criticism against ptolemy and other ancient authorities in his doubts concerning ptolemy and book of optics who are the ash'arites ? dar al-iftaa al-missriyyah the ash'ari 's school of theology dar al-iftaa al-missriyyah ashariyys - the knights of knowledge and the pioneers of success www.sunna.info

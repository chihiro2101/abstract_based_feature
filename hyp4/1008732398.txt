transcendentalism is closely related to unitarianism , the dominant religious movement in boston in the early nineteenth century it started to develop after unitarianism took hold at harvard university , following the elections of henry ware as the hollis professor of divinity in 1805 and of john thornton kirkland as president in 1810 transcendentalism was not a rejection of unitarianism ; rather , it developed as an organic consequence of the unitarian emphasis on free conscience and the value of intellectual reason thus , transcendentalism was not born as a counter-movement to unitarianism , but as a parallel movement to the very ideas introduced by the unitarians transcendentalism became a coherent movement and a sacred organization with the founding of the transcendental club in cambridge , massachusetts , on september 8 , 1836 , by prominent new england intellectuals , including george putnam ( unitarian minister ) , ralph waldo emerson , and frederic henry hedge female members included sophia ripley , margaret fuller , elizabeth peabody , ellen sturgis hooper , and caroline sturgis tappan by the late 1840s , emerson believed that the movement was dying out , and even more so after the death of margaret fuller in 1850 there was , however , a second wave of transcendentalists , including moncure conway , octavius brooks frothingham , samuel longfellow and franklin benjamin sanborn transcendentalists desire to ground their religion and philosophy in principles based upon the german romanticism of johann gottfried herder and friedrich schleiermacher transcendentalism merged '' english and german romanticism , the biblical criticism of herder and schleiermacher , the skepticism of hume '' , and the transcendental philosophy of immanuel kant ( and of german idealism more generally ) , interpreting kant 's a priori categories as a priori knowledge transcendentalists believe that society and its institutions—particularly organized religion and political parties—corrupt the purity of the individual in his 1842 lecture '' the transcendentalist '' , he suggested that the goal of a purely transcendental outlook on life was impossible to attain in practice : transcendentalists have a deep gratitude and appreciation for nature , not only for aesthetic purposes , but also as a tool to observe and understand the structured inner workings of the natural world transcendentalism is , in many aspects , the first notable american intellectual movement major figures in the transcendentalist movement were ralph waldo emerson , henry david thoreau , margaret fuller , and amos bronson alcott

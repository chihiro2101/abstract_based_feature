saadia was born in dilâẓ , in the district of fayyum , upper egypt , in 892 ( variant 882 ) ce he immigrated to palestine in 915 , at the age of 23 , where he studied in tiberias under the scholar abu kathir yaḥya al-katib , a jewish theologian ( mutakallim ) mentioned also by ibn hazm saadia , in '' sefer ha-galui '' , stresses his jewish lineage , claiming to belong to the noble family of shelah , son of judah , and counting among his ancestors hanina ben dosa , the famous ascetic of the first century expression was given to this claim by saadia in calling his son dosa ( this son , dosa ben saadia later served as gaon of sura from 1012–1018 ) regarding joseph , saadia 's father , a statement of aaron ben meir has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave egypt and died in jaffa , probably during saadia 's prolonged residence in the holy land the usual epithet of '' al-fayyumi '' refers to saadia 's native place , the fayyum in upper egypt ; in hebrew it is often given as '' pitomi , '' derived from a contemporary identification of fayum with the biblical pithom ( an identification found in saadia 's own works ) at a young age of 20 saadia began composing his first great work , the hebrew dictionary which he entitled agron later , one of saadia 's chief disputants was the karaite by the name of abu al-surri ben zuṭa , who is referred to by abraham ibn ezra , in his commentary on the pentateuch ( exo in 922 , six years before saadia was appointed gaon of babylonia , a controversy arose concerning the hebrew calendar , that threatened the entire jewish community a contemporary author , remy landau , suggests that he wanted to optimize the rule and thereby reduce the frequency of this postponement ( the meir-saadia calendar controversy ) saadia addressed a warning to him , and in babylon he placed his knowledge and pen at the disposal of the exilarch david ben zakkai and the scholars of the academy , adding his own letters to those sent by them to the communities of the diaspora ( 922 ) in babylonia he wrote his '' sefer ha-mo'adim , '' or '' book of festivals , '' in which he refuted the assertions of ben meir regarding the calendar , and helped to avert from the jewish community the perils of schism the exilarch david ben zakkai insisted on appointing him as gaon ( head of the academy ) , despite the weight of precedent ( no foreigner had ever served as gaon before ) , and against the advice of the aged nissim nahrwani , a resh kallah at sura , who feared a confrontation between the two strong-willed personalities , david and saadia ( nissim declared , however , that if david was determined to see saadia in the position , then he would be ready to become the first of saadia 's followers when the son of the exilarch threatened saadia with violence to secure his compliance , and was roughly handled by saadia 's servant , open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon zakkai appointed joseph ben jacob as gaon of sura , while saadia conferred the exilarchate on david 's brother hassan ( josiah ; 930 ) saadia 's influence upon the jews of yemen has been exceptionally great , as many of saadia 's extant works were preserved by the community and used extensively by them the yemenite jewish community also adopted thirteen penitential verse written by saadia for yom kippur , as well as the hosh'anah liturgical poems composed by him for the seventh day of sukkot abraham ibn ezra , in his own commentary of the pentateuch , wrote scathing remarks on saadia 's commentary , abraham ibn ezra 's commentary of the pentateuch , on genesis 2:11–12 and on exodus 28:30 , as well as in his critique on rsg 's identification of the bird , ʿozniah ( the steppe eagle ) , in leviticus 11:13 saying : '' he does n't have an oral tradition … perhaps he has a vision in a dream , while he has already erred with respect to certain places … ; therefore , we will not rely on his dreams '' however , saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty odd unclean fowl that are mentioned in the hebrew bible ( leviticus 11:13 & ndash ; 19 ; deuteronomy 14:12 & ndash ; 18 ) , his translation was based on an oral tradition received by him 59 ( hebrew ) ; yosef qafih , rabbi saadia gaon 's commentaries on the pentateuch , mossad harav kook : jerusalem 1984 , p 33:17 , improperly translated as '' unicorn '' in some english translations , is a word that is now used in modern hebrew to represent the '' oryx , '' although saadia understood the same word to mean '' rhinoceros '' , and writes there the judeo-arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature in some instances , saadia 's biblical translations reflect his own rationale of difficult hebrew words based on their lexical root , and he will , at times , reject the earlier aramaic targum for his own understanding using this as genetic proof of the son 's true inheritance , saadia had the servant return the man 's property to his son tehillim ( judeo-arabic translation and commentary , which he called kitāb al-tasbiḥ '' the book of praise '' ) hebrew translation along with original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) daniel hebrew translation along with the original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) saadia translated megillat antiochus into judeo-arabic and wrote an introduction the siddur of saadia gaon ( kitāb jāmiʿ al-ṣalawāt wal-tasābīḥ ) , containing the texts of the prayers , commentary in arabic and original synagogal poetry '' '' kitab al-'ibbur , '' or '' book of the calendar , '' likewise apparently containing polemics against karaite jews ; '' sefer ha-mo'adim , '' or '' book of festivals , '' the hebrew polemic against ben meir which has been mentioned above saadia 's works were the inspiration and basis for later jewish writers , such as berachyah in his encyclopedic philosophical work sefer hahibbur ( the book of compilation ) yosef qafih published works ( hebrew translations of a number of saadia gaon 's works ) jewish philosophy

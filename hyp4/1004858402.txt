saadia was born in dilâẓ , in the district of fayyum , upper egypt , in 892 ( variant 882 ) ce he immigrated to palestine in 915 , at the age of 23 , where he studied in tiberias under the scholar abu kathir yaḥya al-katib , a jewish theologian ( mutakallim ) mentioned also by ibn hazm saadia , in '' sefer ha-galui '' , stresses his jewish lineage , claiming to belong to the noble family of shelah , son of judah , and counting among his ancestors hanina ben dosa , the famous ascetic of the first century expression was given to this claim by saadia in calling his son dosa ( this son , dosa ben saadia later served as gaon of sura from 1012–1018 ) regarding joseph , saadia 's father , a statement of aaron ben meir has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave egypt and died in jaffa , probably during saadia 's prolonged residence in the holy land the usual epithet of '' al-fayyumi '' refers to saadia 's native place , the fayyum in upper egypt ; in hebrew it is often given as '' pitomi , '' derived from a contemporary identification of fayum with the biblical pithom ( an identification found in saadia 's own works ) at a young age of 20 saadia began composing his first great work , the hebrew dictionary which he entitled agron abraham firkovich , hebrew newspaper hamelitz - 1868 , issue 26–27 at 23 he composed a polemic against the followers of anan ben david , particularly solomon ben yeruham , thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to karaism , in defense of rabbinic judaism later , one of saadia 's chief disputants was the karaite by the name of abu al-surri ben zuṭa , who is referred to by abraham ibn ezra , in his commentary on the pentateuch ( exo dispute with ben meir in 922 , six years before saadia was appointed gaon of babylonia , a controversy arose concerning the hebrew calendar , that threatened the entire jewish community since hillel ii ( around 359 ce ) , the calendar had been based on a series of rules ( described more fully in maimonides ' code laws of the sanctification of the moon , chs in that particular year , this change would result in a two-day schism with the major jewish communities in babylonia : according to ben meir the first day of passover would be on a sunday , while according to the generally accepted rule it would be on tuesday saadia was in aleppo , on his way from the east , when he learned of ben meir 's regulation of the jewish calendar ( nissim declared , however , that if david was determined to see saadia in the position , then he would be ready to become the first of saadia 's followers in a probate case saadia refused to sign a verdict of the exilarch which he thought unjust , although the gaon of pumbedita had subscribed to it when the son of the exilarch threatened saadia with violence to secure his compliance , and was roughly handled by saadia 's servant , open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon zakkai appointed joseph ben jacob as gaon of sura , while saadia conferred the exilarchate on david 's brother hassan ( josiah ; 930 ) saadia was attacked by the exilarch and by his chief adherent , the young but learned aaron ibn sargado ( later gaon of pumbedita , 943-960 ) , in hebrew pamphlets , fragments of which show a hatred on the part of the exilarch and his partisans that did not shrink from scandal saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch ( tafsir ) was copied by them in nearly all their handwritten codices , and they originally studied saadia 's major work of philosophy , beliefs and opinions , in its original judeo-arabic , although by the early 20th-century , only fragments had survived as much as saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the torah ( tafsīr ) has brought relief and succor to jews living in arabic-speaking countries , his identification of places , fauna and flora , and the stones of the breastplate , has found him at variance with some scholars saying : '' he does n't have an oral tradition … perhaps he has a vision in a dream , while he has already erred with respect to certain places … ; therefore , we will not rely on his dreams 58 ( hebrew ) ; yosef qafih , rabbi saadia gaon 's commentaries on the pentateuch , mossad harav kook : jerusalem 1984 , p '' zohar amar , flora of the bible , rubin mass ltd 59 ( hebrew ) ;

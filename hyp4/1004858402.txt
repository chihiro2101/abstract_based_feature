saadia was born in dilâẓ , in the district of fayyum , upper egypt , in 892 ( variant 882 ) ce he immigrated to palestine in 915 , at the age of 23 , where he studied in tiberias under the scholar abu kathir yaḥya al-katib , a jewish theologian ( mutakallim ) mentioned also by ibn hazm saadia , in '' sefer ha-galui '' , stresses his jewish lineage , claiming to belong to the noble family of shelah , son of judah , and counting among his ancestors hanina ben dosa , the famous ascetic of the first century expression was given to this claim by saadia in calling his son dosa ( this son , dosa ben saadia later served as gaon of sura from 1012–1018 ) regarding joseph , saadia 's father , a statement of aaron ben meir has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave egypt and died in jaffa , probably during saadia 's prolonged residence in the holy land at a young age of 20 saadia began composing his first great work , the hebrew dictionary which he entitled agron abraham firkovich , hebrew newspaper hamelitz - 1868 , issue 26–27 at 23 he composed a polemic against the followers of anan ben david , particularly solomon ben yeruham , thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to karaism , in defense of rabbinic judaism later , one of saadia 's chief disputants was the karaite by the name of abu al-surri ben zuṭa , who is referred to by abraham ibn ezra , in his commentary on the pentateuch ( exo saadia was reconciled with the exilarch and returned to serve in his former position , although r dispute with ben meir in 922 , six years before saadia was appointed gaon of babylonia , a controversy arose concerning the hebrew calendar , that threatened the entire jewish community since hillel ii ( around 359 ce ) , the calendar had been based on a series of rules ( described more fully in maimonides ' code laws of the sanctification of the moon , chs rabbi aaron ben meir , the gaon of the leading yeshiva in israel ( then located in ramle ) , claimed a tradition according to which the cutoff point was 642/1080 of an hour ( approximately 35 minutes ) after noon in that particular year , this change would result in a two-day schism with the major jewish communities in babylonia : according to ben meir the first day of passover would be on a sunday , while according to the generally accepted rule it would be on tuesday saadia was in aleppo , on his way from the east , when he learned of ben meir 's regulation of the jewish calendar saadia addressed a warning to him , and in babylon he placed his knowledge and pen at the disposal of the exilarch david ben zakkai and the scholars of the academy , adding his own letters to those sent by them to the communities of the diaspora ( 922 ) ( nissim declared , however , that if david was determined to see saadia in the position , then he would be ready to become the first of saadia 's followers in a probate case saadia refused to sign a verdict of the exilarch which he thought unjust , although the gaon of pumbedita had subscribed to it when the son of the exilarch threatened saadia with violence to secure his compliance , and was roughly handled by saadia 's servant , open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon zakkai appointed joseph ben jacob as gaon of sura , while saadia conferred the exilarchate on david 's brother hassan ( josiah ; 930 ) saadia was attacked by the exilarch and by his chief adherent , the young but learned aaron ibn sargado ( later gaon of pumbedita , 943-960 ) , in hebrew pamphlets , fragments of which show a hatred on the part of the exilarch and his partisans that did not shrink from scandal saadia 's influence upon the jews of yemen has been exceptionally great , as many of saadia 's extant works were preserved by the community and used extensively by them the yemenite jewish community also adopted thirteen penitential verse written by saadia for yom kippur , as well as the hosh'anah liturgical poems composed by him for the seventh day of sukkot saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch ( tafsir ) was copied by them in nearly all their handwritten codices , and they originally studied saadia 's major work of philosophy , beliefs and opinions , in its original judeo-arabic , although by the early 20th-century , only fragments had survived '' however , saadia assures his readers elsewhere that when he rendered translations for the twenty odd unclean fowl that are mentioned in the hebrew bible ( leviticus 11:13 & ndash ; 19 ; deuteronomy 14:12 & ndash ; 18 ) , his translation was based on an oral tradition received by him 125 ( note 7 ) ( hebrew ) the question often asked by scholars now is whether saadia applied this principle in his other translations story of abraham and sarah , the selling of joseph , etc in some instances , saadia 's biblical translations reflect his own rationale of difficult hebrew words based on their lexical root , and he will , at times , reject the earlier aramaic targum for his own understanding his principal philosophical work was completed in 933 ; and four years later , through ibn sargado 's father-in-law , bishr ben aaron , the two enemies were reconciled as a means of popular religious enlightenment , saadia 's translation presented the scriptures even to the unlearned in a rational form which aimed at the greatest possible degree of clarity and consistency yosef qafih published works ( hebrew translations of a number of saadia gaon 's works ) jewish philosophy baron , '' saadia 's communal activities '' , saadia anniversary volume ( 1943 ) 9-74

saadia was born in dilâẓ , in the district of fayyum , upper egypt , in 892 ( variant 882 ) ce he immigrated to palestine in 915 , at the age of 23 , where he studied in tiberias under the scholar abu kathir yaḥya al-katib , a jewish theologian ( mutakallim ) mentioned also by ibn hazm saadia , in '' sefer ha-galui '' , stresses his jewish lineage , claiming to belong to the noble family of shelah , son of judah , and counting among his ancestors hanina ben dosa , the famous ascetic of the first century expression was given to this claim by saadia in calling his son dosa ( this son , dosa ben saadia later served as gaon of sura from 1012–1018 ) regarding joseph , saadia 's father , a statement of aaron ben meir has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave egypt and died in jaffa , probably during saadia 's prolonged residence in the holy land the usual epithet of '' al-fayyumi '' refers to saadia 's native place , the fayyum in upper egypt ; in hebrew it is often given as '' pitomi , '' derived from a contemporary identification of fayum with the biblical pithom ( an identification found in saadia 's own works ) at a young age of 20 saadia began composing his first great work , the hebrew dictionary which he entitled agron later , one of saadia 's chief disputants was the karaite by the name of abu al-surri ben zuṭa , who is referred to by abraham ibn ezra , in his commentary on the pentateuch ( exo in 922 , six years before saadia was appointed gaon of babylonia , a controversy arose concerning the hebrew calendar , that threatened the entire jewish community one of these rules required the date of rosh hashanah to be postponed if the calculated lunar conjunction occurred at noon or later a contemporary author , remy landau , suggests that he wanted to optimize the rule and thereby reduce the frequency of this postponement ( the meir-saadia calendar controversy ) saadia was in aleppo , on his way from the east , when he learned of ben meir 's regulation of the jewish calendar his dispute with ben meir was an important factor in the call to sura which he received in 928 the exilarch david ben zakkai insisted on appointing him as gaon ( head of the academy ) , despite the weight of precedent ( no foreigner had ever served as gaon before ) , and against the advice of the aged nissim nahrwani , a resh kallah at sura , who feared a confrontation between the two strong-willed personalities , david and saadia ( nissim declared , however , that if david was determined to see saadia in the position , then he would be ready to become the first of saadia 's followers when the son of the exilarch threatened saadia with violence to secure his compliance , and was roughly handled by saadia 's servant , open war broke out between the exilarch and the gaon saadia 's influence upon the jews of yemen has been exceptionally great , as many of saadia 's extant works were preserved by the community and used extensively by them saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch ( tafsir ) was copied by them in nearly all their handwritten codices , and they originally studied saadia 's major work of philosophy , beliefs and opinions , in its original judeo-arabic , although by the early 20th-century , only fragments had survived as much as saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the torah ( tafsīr ) has brought relief and succor to jews living in arabic-speaking countries , his identification of places , fauna and flora , and the stones of the breastplate , has found him at variance with some scholars 58 ( hebrew ) ; yosef qafih , rabbi saadia gaon 's commentaries on the pentateuch , mossad harav kook : jerusalem 1984 , p 125 ( note 7 ) ( hebrew ) the question often asked by scholars now is whether saadia applied this principle in his other translations 33:17 , improperly translated as '' unicorn '' in some english translations , is a word that is now used in modern hebrew to represent the '' oryx , '' although saadia understood the same word to mean '' rhinoceros '' , and writes there the judeo-arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature 30:34 ( explained in taanit 7a as meaning '' each spice pounded separately '' ) , saadia sometimes deviates from the rabbinic tradition in his judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch , in this case explaining its sense as '' having them made of equal portions 940 ) , being followed a few months later by the exilarch 's son judah , while david 's young grandson was nobly protected by saadia as by a father according to a statement made by abraham ibn daud and doubtless derived from saadia 's son dosa , saadia himself died in babylonia at sura in 942 , at the age of sixty , of '' black gall '' ( melancholia ) , repeated illnesses having undermined his health megillot hebrew translation along with original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( available online at but missing pages רמד-רמה pages ק-קא were scanned twice ) tehillim ( judeo-arabic translation and commentary , which he called kitāb al-tasbiḥ '' the book of praise '' ) hebrew translation along with original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) sefer yetzirah hashalem ( with rabbi saadia gaon 's commentary ) , yosef qafih ( editor ) , jerusalem 1972 , p there was perhaps a special polemic of saadia against ben zuta , though the data regarding this controversy between is known only from the gaon 's gloss on the torah the position assigned to saadia in the oldest list of hebrew grammarians , which is contained in the introduction to abraham ibn ezra 's '' moznayim , '' has not been challenged even by the latest historical investigations in his commentary on the '' sefer yetzirah '' , saadia sought to render lucid and intelligible the content of this esoteric work by the light of philosophy and scientific knowledge , especially by a system of hebrew phonology which he himself had founded . henry malter , saadia gaon : his life and works ( morris loeb series , philadelphia : jewish publication society of america , 1921 , several later reprints )

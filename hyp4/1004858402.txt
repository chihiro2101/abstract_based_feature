saadia was born in dilâẓ , in the district of fayyum , upper egypt , in 892 ( variant 882 ) ce he immigrated to palestine in 915 , at the age of 23 , where he studied in tiberias under the scholar abu kathir yaḥya al-katib , a jewish theologian ( mutakallim ) mentioned also by ibn hazm saadia , in '' sefer ha-galui '' , stresses his jewish lineage , claiming to belong to the noble family of shelah , son of judah , and counting among his ancestors hanina ben dosa , the famous ascetic of the first century expression was given to this claim by saadia in calling his son dosa ( this son , dosa ben saadia later served as gaon of sura from 1012–1018 ) regarding joseph , saadia 's father , a statement of aaron ben meir has been preserved saying that he was compelled to leave egypt and died in jaffa , probably during saadia 's prolonged residence in the holy land the usual epithet of '' al-fayyumi '' refers to saadia 's native place , the fayyum in upper egypt ; in hebrew it is often given as '' pitomi , '' derived from a contemporary identification of fayum with the biblical pithom ( an identification found in saadia 's own works ) at a young age of 20 saadia began composing his first great work , the hebrew dictionary which he entitled agron abraham firkovich , hebrew newspaper hamelitz - 1868 , issue 26–27 at 23 he composed a polemic against the followers of anan ben david , particularly solomon ben yeruham , thus beginning the activity which was to prove important in opposition to karaism , in defense of rabbinic judaism later , one of saadia 's chief disputants was the karaite by the name of abu al-surri ben zuṭa , who is referred to by abraham ibn ezra , in his commentary on the pentateuch ( exo saadia recused himself from teaching , because of a dispute that had fallen out between him and the exilarch in 922 , six years before saadia was appointed gaon of babylonia , a controversy arose concerning the hebrew calendar , that threatened the entire jewish community rabbi aaron ben meir , the gaon of the leading yeshiva in israel ( then located in ramle ) , claimed a tradition according to which the cutoff point was 642/1080 of an hour ( approximately 35 minutes ) after noon saadia was in aleppo , on his way from the east , when he learned of ben meir 's regulation of the jewish calendar saadia addressed a warning to him , and in babylon he placed his knowledge and pen at the disposal of the exilarch david ben zakkai and the scholars of the academy , adding his own letters to those sent by them to the communities of the diaspora ( 922 ) ( nissim declared , however , that if david was determined to see saadia in the position , then he would be ready to become the first of saadia 's followers in a probate case saadia refused to sign a verdict of the exilarch which he thought unjust , although the gaon of pumbedita had subscribed to it zakkai appointed joseph ben jacob as gaon of sura , while saadia conferred the exilarchate on david 's brother hassan ( josiah ; 930 ) saadia 's influence upon the jews of yemen has been exceptionally great , as many of saadia 's extant works were preserved by the community and used extensively by them as much as saadia 's judeo-arabic translation of the torah ( tafsīr ) has brought relief and succor to jews living in arabic-speaking countries , his identification of places , fauna and flora , and the stones of the breastplate , has found him at variance with some scholars 59 ( hebrew ) ; yosef qafih , rabbi saadia gaon 's commentaries on the pentateuch , mossad harav kook : jerusalem 1984 , p 33:17 , improperly translated as '' unicorn '' in some english translations , is a word that is now used in modern hebrew to represent the '' oryx , '' although saadia understood the same word to mean '' rhinoceros '' , and writes there the judeo-arabic word אלכרכדאן for the creature ; saadia adopts in principle the method of the sages that even the episodic-like parts of the bible ( e.g in some instances , saadia 's biblical translations reflect his own rationale of difficult hebrew words based on their lexical root , and he will , at times , reject the earlier aramaic targum for his own understanding 30:34 ( explained in taanit 7a as meaning '' each spice pounded separately '' ) , saadia sometimes deviates from the rabbinic tradition in his judeo-arabic translation of the pentateuch , in this case explaining its sense as '' having them made of equal portions the fourteen years which saadia spent in babylonia did not interrupt his literary activity his principal philosophical work was completed in 933 ; and four years later , through ibn sargado 's father-in-law , bishr ben aaron , the two enemies were reconciled iyyov ( book of job ) hebrew translation along with the original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) and mishlei hebrew translation along with the original judeo-arabic by rabbi yosef qafih ( first 40 pages viewable for free ) the siddur of saadia gaon ( kitāb jāmiʿ al-ṣalawāt wal-tasābīḥ ) , containing the texts of the prayers , commentary in arabic and original synagogal poetry '' sefer ha-galui , '' also composed in hebrew and in the same flowery biblical style as the '' sefer ha-mo'adim , '' being an autobiographical and apologetic work directed against the exilarch ( rosh galuth ) , david b in his commentary on the '' sefer yetzirah '' , saadia sought to render lucid and intelligible the content of this esoteric work by the light of philosophy and scientific knowledge , especially by a system of hebrew phonology which he himself had founded . henry malter , saadia gaon : his life and works ( morris loeb series , philadelphia : jewish publication society of america , 1921 , several later reprints )

prussian blue pigment is significant since it was the first stable and relatively lightfast blue pigment to be widely used following the loss of knowledge regarding the synthesis of egyptian blue european painters had previously used a number of pigments such as indigo dye , smalt , and tyrian purple , and the extremely expensive ultramarine made from lapis lazuli japanese painting and woodblock print artists , likewise , did not have access to a long-lasting blue pigment until they began to import prussian blue from europe prussian blue ( also · x was probably synthesized for the first time by the paint maker diesbach in berlin around 1706 most historical sources do not mention a first name of diesbach the pigment is believed to have been accidentally created when diesbach used potash tainted with blood to create some red cochineal dye instead , the blood , potash , and iron sulfate reacted to create a compound known as iron ferrocyanide , which , unlike the desired red pigment , has a very distinct blue hue to date , the entombment of christ , dated 1709 by pieter van der werff ( picture gallery , sanssouci , potsdam ) is the oldest known painting where prussian blue was used at around the same time , prussian blue arrived in paris , where antoine watteau and later his successors nicolas lancret and jean-baptiste pater used it in their paintings in 1731 , georg ernst stahl published an account of the first synthesis of prussian blue diesbach was attempting to create a red lake pigment from cochineal , but obtained the blue instead as a result of the contaminated potash he was using lowengard , sarah ( 2008 ) chapter 23 : prussian blue in the creation of color in eighteenth-century europe macquer made the important step of showing prussian blue could be reduced to a salt of iron and a new acid , which could be used to reconstitute the dye macquer , pierre-joseph ( 1752 ) '' éxamen chymique de bleu de prusse , '' mémoires de l'académie royale des sciences année 1752 was eventually given the name ( literally '' blue acid '' ) because of its derivation from prussian blue , and in english became known popularly as prussic acid cyanide , a colorless anion that forms in the process of making prussian blue , derives its name from the greek word for dark blue from the beginning of the 18th century , prussian blue was the predominant uniform coat color worn by the infantry and artillery regiments of the prussian army prussian blue is produced by oxidation of ferrous ferrocyanide salts '' insoluble '' prussian blue is produced if , in the reactions above , an excess of is added : :4 + 3 → & nbsp ; egon wiberg , nils wiberg , arnold frederick holleman : inorganic chemistry , p.1444 academic press , 2001 ; google books despite the fact that it is prepared from cyanide salts , prussian blue is not toxic because the cyanide groups are tightly bound to iron in former times , the addition of iron ( ii ) salts to a solution of ferricyanide was thought to afford a material different from prussian blue prussian blue is strongly colored and tends towards black and dark blue when mixed into oil paints the intense blue color of prussian blue is associated with the energy of the transfer of electrons from fe ( ii ) to fe ( iii ) engineer 's blue , prussian blue in an oily base , is the traditional material used for spotting metal surfaces such as surface plates and bearings for hand scraper the ferric chloride and ferrocyanide react to form prussian blue

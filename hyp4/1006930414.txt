prussian blue pigment is significant since it was the first stable and relatively lightfast blue pigment to be widely used following the loss of knowledge regarding the synthesis of egyptian blue european painters had previously used a number of pigments such as indigo dye , smalt , and tyrian purple , and the extremely expensive ultramarine made from lapis lazuli japanese painting and woodblock print artists , likewise , did not have access to a long-lasting blue pigment until they began to import prussian blue from europe prussian blue ( also · x was probably synthesized for the first time by the paint maker diesbach in berlin around 1706 the pigment is believed to have been accidentally created when diesbach used potash tainted with blood to create some red cochineal dye instead , the blood , potash , and iron sulfate reacted to create a compound known as iron ferrocyanide , which , unlike the desired red pigment , has a very distinct blue hue frisch himself is the author of the first known publication of prussian blue in the paper in 1710 , as can be deduced from his letters to date , the entombment of christ , dated 1709 by pieter van der werff ( picture gallery , sanssouci , potsdam ) is the oldest known painting where prussian blue was used around 1710 , painters at the prussian court were already using the pigment in 1731 , georg ernst stahl published an account of the first synthesis of prussian blue diesbach was attempting to create a red lake pigment from cochineal , but obtained the blue instead as a result of the contaminated potash he was using the new acid , hydrogen cyanide , first isolated from prussian blue in pure form and characterized in 1782 by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele , scheele , carl w was eventually given the name ( literally '' blue acid '' ) because of its derivation from prussian blue , and in english became known popularly as prussic acid cyanide , a colorless anion that forms in the process of making prussian blue , derives its name from the greek word for dark blue as ( dark blue ) , this shade achieved a symbolic importance and continued to be worn by german soldiers for ceremonial and off-duty occasions until the outbreak of world war i , when it was superseded by greenish-gray field gray academic press , 2001 ; google books despite the fact that it is prepared from cyanide salts , prussian blue is not toxic because the cyanide groups are tightly bound to iron in former times , the addition of iron ( ii ) salts to a solution of ferricyanide was thought to afford a material different from prussian blue despite being one of the oldest known synthetic compounds , the composition of prussian blue remained uncertain for many years the chemical formula of insoluble prussian blue is & nbsp ; · & nbsp ; x , where x & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 14–16 one-fourth of the sites of subunits are vacant ( empty ) , leaving three such groups prussian blue is strongly colored and tends towards black and dark blue when mixed into oil paints certain crayons were once colored with prussian blue ( later relabeled midnight blue ) pharmaceutical-grade prussian blue in particular is used for people who have ingested thallium ( tl + ) or radioactive caesium ( 134 cs + , 137 cs + ) prussian blue is a common histopathology stain used by pathologists to detect the presence of iron in biopsy specimens , such as in bone marrow samples prussian blue is formed in the prussian blue assay for total phenols

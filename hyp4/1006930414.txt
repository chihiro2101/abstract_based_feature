prussian blue pigment is significant since it was the first stable and relatively lightfast blue pigment to be widely used following the loss of knowledge regarding the synthesis of egyptian blue european painters had previously used a number of pigments such as indigo dye , smalt , and tyrian purple , and the extremely expensive ultramarine made from lapis lazuli japanese painting and woodblock print artists , likewise , did not have access to a long-lasting blue pigment until they began to import prussian blue from europe prussian blue ( also · x was probably synthesized for the first time by the paint maker diesbach in berlin around 1706 the pigment is believed to have been accidentally created when diesbach used potash tainted with blood to create some red cochineal dye instead , the blood , potash , and iron sulfate reacted to create a compound known as iron ferrocyanide , which , unlike the desired red pigment , has a very distinct blue hue it was named and in 1709 by its first trader not later than 1708 , frisch began to promote and sell the pigment across europe frisch himself is the author of the first known publication of prussian blue in the paper in 1710 , as can be deduced from his letters to date , the entombment of christ , dated 1709 by pieter van der werff ( picture gallery , sanssouci , potsdam ) is the oldest known painting where prussian blue was used in 1731 , georg ernst stahl published an account of the first synthesis of prussian blue diesbach was attempting to create a red lake pigment from cochineal , but obtained the blue instead as a result of the contaminated potash he was using lowengard , sarah ( 2008 ) chapter 23 : prussian blue in the creation of color in eighteenth-century europe macquer made the important step of showing prussian blue could be reduced to a salt of iron and a new acid , which could be used to reconstitute the dye the new acid , hydrogen cyanide , first isolated from prussian blue in pure form and characterized in 1782 by swedish chemist carl wilhelm scheele , scheele , carl w was eventually given the name ( literally '' blue acid '' ) because of its derivation from prussian blue , and in english became known popularly as prussic acid haythornthwaite , philip ( 1991 ) frederick the great 's army – infantry oxidation of this white solid with hydrogen peroxide or sodium chlorate produces ferricyanide and affords prussian blue '' insoluble '' prussian blue is produced if , in the reactions above , an excess of is added : :4 + 3 → & nbsp ; egon wiberg , nils wiberg , arnold frederick holleman : inorganic chemistry , p.1444 journal of toxicology , suicide attempt by ingestion of potassium ferricyanide other polymeric cyanometalates are similarly stable with low toxicity prussian blue is a microcrystalline blue powder the variability of prussian blue 's composition is attributable to its low solubility , which leads to its rapid precipitation without the time to achieve full equilibrium between solid and liquid this change is caused by reduction of the fe ( iii ) to fe ( ii ) , eliminating the intervalence charge transfer that causes prussian blue 's color iron deposits in tissue then form the purple prussian blue dye in place , and are visualized as blue or purple deposits prussian blue is formed in the prussian blue assay for total phenols

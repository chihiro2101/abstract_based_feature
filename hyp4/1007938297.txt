the traditional view has been that perpetua , felicity and the others were martyred owing to a decree of roman emperor septimius severus ( 193–211 ) this is based on a reference to a decree severus is said to have issued forbidding conversions to judaism and christianity , but this decree is known only from one source , the augustan history , an unreliable mix of fact and fiction a brief introduction by the editor ( chapters i–ii ) is followed by the narrative and visions of perpetua ( iii–ix ) , and the vision of saturus ( xi–xiii ) at the encouragement of her brother , perpetua asks for and receives a vision , in which she climbs a dangerous ladder to which various weapons are attached ( iv ) at the foot of a ladder is a serpent , which is faced first by saturus and later by perpetua ( iv ) at the conclusion of her dream , perpetua realizes that the martyrs will suffer ( iv ) perpetua 's father visits her in prison and pleads with her , but perpetua remains steadfast in her faith ( v ) she is brought to a hearing before the governor hilarianus and the martyrs confess their christian faith ( vi ) in a second vision , perpetua sees her brother dinocrates , who had died unbaptized from cancer at the early age of seven ( vii ) perpetua 's father again visits the prison , and pudens ( the warden ) shows the martyrs ' honor ( ix ) the day before her martyrdom , perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts but with the devil himself ( x ) saturus , who is also said to have recorded his own vision , sees himself and perpetua transported eastward by four angels to a beautiful garden , where they meet jocundus , saturninus , artaxius , and quintus , four other christians who are burnt alive during the same persecution ( xi–xii ) the text describes perpetua 's death as follows ; '' but perpetua , that she might have some taste of pain , was pierced between the bones and shrieked out ; and when the swordsman 's hand wandered still ( for he was a novice ) , herself set it upon her own neck scholars generally believe that the passio ss perpetuae et felicitatis narrative was in fact , written by perpetua the personal account of a female martyr is also rare , as the stories of other female martyrs were recorded collectively perpetua 's style is described as '' emotional '' , '' personal '' , '' fragmented '' and '' colloquial '' , which is fitting with the circumstances under which she would have been writing brent shaw argues that the editor of the story rewrites perpetua 's experience in such a way that affirms the technical value of her martyrdom while simultaneously presenting her actions as unnatural others argue that felicity may have been the initial source for the dream , an attribution changed by the editor in order to circumvent the problematic implications of a female slave who can receive visions the acta notes that the martyrdom occurred in the year when minucius timinianus was proconsul in the africa ( province ) , but timinianus is not otherwise attested in history werner eck notes that the greek version of the acta calls the proconsul μινούκιος ὀππιανός , or minicius opimianus , who is recorded as proconsul for 202/203 in the text , perpetua 's relationship with her father is the most prominently featured of all her familial ties , and she directly interacts with him four times ( iii , v , vi , and ix ) perpetua herself may have deemed this relationship to be her most important , given what is known about its importance within roman society perpetua and felicity also defer their roles as mothers to remain loyal to christ , leaving behind young children at the time of their death although the narrator does describe perpetua as '' honorably married '' , no husband appears in the text heffernan , the passion of perpetua and felicity “ the passion of perpetua , ” past and present 139 , ( may 1993 ) , jstor 30 early christian writings : acts of perpetua medieval sourcebook : the passion of saints perpetua and felicity & nbsp ; 223 of saint perpetua martyrdom of perpetua and felicitas 2012 translation and audio version saints perpetua and felicity at the christian iconography web site perpetua and felicity section of caxton 's translation of the golden legend no

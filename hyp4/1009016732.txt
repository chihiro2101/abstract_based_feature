later , during the peak time of chera-chola-pandya , this region became a part of the chera kingdom ( except for the ay kingdom which always remained independent ) the chera empire had dissolved by around 1100 and thereafter the territory comprised numerous small kingdoms until the time of marthanda varma who , as king of venad from 1729 , employed brutal methods to unify them travancore 1871.jpg map of travancore in 1871 the kingdom of travancore was located at the extreme southern tip of the indian subcontinent till the end of the 11th century ad , it was a small principality in the ay kingdom the ays were the earliest ruling dynasty in southern kerala , who , at their zenith , ruled over a region from nagercoil in the south to trivandrum in the north though a series of attacks by the resurgent pandyas between the 7th and 8th centuries caused the decline of the ays , the dynasty was powerful till the beginning of the 10th century when the ay power diminished , venad became the southernmost principality of the second chera kingdom however , the chera capital , mahodayapuram , also fell in the subsequent chola attack , which compelled the chera king , rama varma kulasekara , to shift his capital to kollam thus , rama varma kulasekara , the last emperor of the chera dynasty , is probably the founder of the venad royal house , and the title of the chera kings , kulasekara , was thenceforth kept by the rulers of venad in the second half of the 12th century , two branches of the ay dynasty , thrippappur and chirava , merged in the venad family , which set up the tradition of designating the ruler of venad as chirava moopan and the heir-apparent as thrippappur moopan the history of travancore began with marthanda varma , who inherited the kingdom of venad ( thrippappur ) , and expanded it into travancore during his reign ( 1729–1758 ) this rule also included travancore-dutch war ( 1739–1753 ) between the dutch east india company who had been allied to some of these kingdoms and travancore travancore became the most dominant state in the kerala region by defeating the powerful zamorin of kozhikode in the battle of purakkad in 1755 ramayyan dalawa , the prime minister ( 1737–1756 ) of marthanda varma , also played an important role in this consolidation and expansion marthanda varma 's successor karthika thirunal rama varma ( 1758–1798 ) , who was popularly known as dharma raja , shifted the capital in 1795 from padmanabhapuram to thiruvananthapuram travancore often allied with the english east india company in military conflicts the mysore

sankaran nampoothiri ( 1798–1799 ) when a section of the travancore army mutinied in 1805 against velu thampi dalawa , he sought refuge with the british resident and later used english east india company troops to crush the mutiny velu thampi also played a key role in renegotiating a new treaty between travancore and the english east india company however , the demands by the east india company for the payment of compensation for their involvement in the travancore-mysore war ( 1791 ) on behalf of travancore , led to tension between the diwan and the east india company resident the east india company army defeated paliath achan 's army in cochin on 27 february 1809 paliath achan surrendered to the east india company and was exiled to madras and later to benaras the allied east india company army and the travancore soldiers camped in pappanamcode , just outside trivandrum velu thampi dalawa now organised a guerrilla struggle against the company , but committed suicide to avoid capture by the travancore army after the mutiny of 1805 against velu thampi dalawa , most of the nair army battalions of travancore had been disbanded , and after velu thampi dalawa 's uprising , almost all of the remaining travancore forces were also disbanded , with the east india company undertaking to serve the king in cases of external and internal aggression file : chithira thirunal

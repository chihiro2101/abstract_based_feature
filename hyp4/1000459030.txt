floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour , the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye , or between the vitreous and the retina the vitreous humour , or vitreous body , is a jelly-like , transparent substance that fills the majority of the eye it lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens , and is one of the four optical components of the eye thus , floaters follow the saccade of the eye , while drifting slowly within the pocket of liquid however , attempting to shift one 's gaze toward them can be difficult because floaters follow the motion of the eye , remaining to the side of the direction of gaze floaters are , in fact , visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye floaters present at birth usually remain lifelong , while those that appear later may disappear within weeks or months however , floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases , especially if the spots seem constantly to drift through the field of vision the shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour or between the vitreous and retina floaters can occur when eyes age ; in rare cases , floaters may be a sign of retinal detachment or a retinal tear the cause of a vitreous floater is due to vitreous syneresis ( liquefaction ) and contraction with age additionally , trauma or injury to the globe can cause vitreous floaters posterior vitreous detachment is more common in people who : are nearsighted ; have undergone cataract surgery ; have had nd : yag laser surgery of the eye ; have had inflammation inside the eye however , if the floater is near the retina , it may not be visible to the observer even if it appears large to the patient the head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement laser vitreolysis is a possible treatment option for the removal of vitreous strands and opacities ( floaters )

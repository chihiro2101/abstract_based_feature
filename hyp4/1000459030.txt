floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour , the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye , or between the vitreous and the retina the vitreous humour , or vitreous body , is a jelly-like , transparent substance that fills the majority of the eye it lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens , and is one of the four optical components of the eye thus , floaters follow the saccade of the eye , while drifting slowly within the pocket of liquid however , attempting to shift one 's gaze toward them can be difficult because floaters follow the motion of the eye , remaining to the side of the direction of gaze floaters are , in fact , visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye the shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour or between the vitreous and retina often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out of the corner of their eye that really is not there floaters can occur when eyes age ; in rare cases , floaters may be a sign of retinal detachment or a retinal tear the cause of a vitreous floater is due to vitreous syneresis ( liquefaction ) and contraction with age this leads to posterior vitreous detachment , in which the vitreous membrane is released from the sensory retina as a complication , part of the retina might be torn off by the departing vitreous membrane , in a process known as retinal detachment the head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye acute-onset floaters and flashes : is this patient at risk for retinal detachment ? jama looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement laser vitreolysis is a possible treatment option for the removal of vitreous strands and opacities ( floaters ) individuals who are myopic or nearsighted have an increased risk of vitreous floaters

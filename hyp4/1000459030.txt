floaters are from objects in pockets of liquid within the vitreous humour , the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye , or between the vitreous and the retina the vitreous humour , or vitreous body , is a jelly-like , transparent substance that fills the majority of the eye it lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens , and is one of the four optical components of the eye thus , floaters follow the saccade of the eye , while drifting slowly within the pocket of liquid however , attempting to shift one 's gaze toward them can be difficult because floaters follow the motion of the eye , remaining to the side of the direction of gaze floaters are , in fact , visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye floaters present at birth usually remain lifelong , while those that appear later may disappear within weeks or months however , floaters are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases , especially if the spots seem constantly to drift through the field of vision floaters can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days , when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see something out of the corner of their eye that really is not there floaters can occur when eyes age ; in rare cases , floaters may be a sign of retinal detachment or a retinal tear this leads to posterior vitreous detachment , in which the vitreous membrane is released from the sensory retina during this detachment , the shrinking vitreous can phosphene , causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field , sometimes referred to as '' flashers '' , a symptom more formally referred to as photopsia posterior vitreous detachment is more common in people who : are nearsighted ; have undergone cataract surgery ; have had nd : yag laser surgery of the eye ; have had inflammation inside the eye the head may be tilted in such a way that one of the floaters drifts towards the central axis of the eye if floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision , then one of the below treatments may be necessary as a result , they often provide a limited view of the vitreous , which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes

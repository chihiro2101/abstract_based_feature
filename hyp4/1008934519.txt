tone mapping reduces the dynamic range , or contrast ratio , of an entire image while retaining localized contrast several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images notable titles include : adobe photoshop affinity photo aurora hdr dynamic photo hdr easyhdr gimp hdr photostudio luminance hdr nik collection hdr efex pro oloneo photoengine ptgui sns-hdr information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of luminance or radiance that can be observed in the real world the values stored for hdr images are often gamma correction ( power law ) or logarithmically encoded , or floating point linear values , since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range le gray used one negative for the sky , and another one with a longer exposure for the sea , and combined the two into one picture in positive this was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner the image took five days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene , which ranges from a bright lamp ( relative to the scene ) to a dark shadow with the advent of color photography , tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film georges cornuéjols and licensees of his patents ( brdi , hymatom ) introduced the principle of hdr video image , in 1986 , by interposing a matricial lcd screen in front of the camera 's image sensor , increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops ) , into an hdr image modern cmos image sensor can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure the wide dynamic range of the captured image is non-linearly compressed into a smaller dynamic range electronic representation

tone mapping reduces the dynamic range , or contrast ratio , of an entire image while retaining localized contrast several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images notable titles include : adobe photoshop affinity photo aurora hdr dynamic photo hdr easyhdr gimp hdr photostudio luminance hdr nik collection hdr efex pro oloneo photoengine ptgui sns-hdr therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred the values stored for hdr images are often gamma correction ( power law ) or logarithmically encoded , or floating point linear values , since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range common are 16-bit ( half precision ) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent hdr pixels such rendering was impossible at the time using standard methods , as the luminosity range was too extreme with the advent of color photography , tone mapping in the darkroom was no longer possible due to the specific timing needed during the developing process of color film the concept of neighborhood tone mapping was applied to video cameras in 1988 by a group from the technion in israel , led by oliver hilsenrath and yehoshua y in 1991 , the first commercial video camera was introduced that performed real-time capturing of multiple images with different exposures , and producing an hdr video image , by hymatom , licensee of georges cornuéjols the image array generated by the first step of mann 's process is called a lightspace image , lightspace picture , or radiance map modern cmos image sensor can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure in security cameras the term used instead of hdr is '' wide dynamic range ''

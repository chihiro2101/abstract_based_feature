tone mapping reduces the dynamic range , or contrast ratio , of an entire image while retaining localized contrast several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred the values stored for hdr images are often gamma correction ( power law ) or logarithmically encoded , or floating point linear values , since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range the idea of using several exposures to adequately reproduce a too-extreme range of luminance was pioneered as early as the 1850s by gustave le gray to render seascapes showing both the sky and the sea le gray used one negative for the sky , and another one with a longer exposure for the sea , and combined the two into one picture in positive in february and april 1990 , georges cornuéjols introduced the first real-time hdr camera that combined two images captured by a sensor or simultaneously by two sensors of the camera in 1993 , another commercial medical camera producing an hdr video image , by the technion the advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for hdr imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors , which had a much smaller dynamic range than film the wide dynamic range of the captured image is non-linearly compressed into a smaller dynamic range electronic representation such hdr imaging is used in extreme dynamic range applications like welding or automotive work in security cameras the term used instead of hdr is '' wide dynamic range '' some of the sensors on modern phones and cameras may even combine the two images on-chip so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing .

although it is a distinct operation , tone mapping is often applied to hdri files by the same software package several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of luminance or radiance that can be observed in the real world this is different from traditional digital images , which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range the image took five days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene , which ranges from a bright lamp ( relative to the scene ) to a dark shadow in february and april 1990 , georges cornuéjols introduced the first real-time hdr camera that combined two images captured by a sensor or simultaneously by two sensors of the camera in 1991 , the first commercial video camera was introduced that performed real-time capturing of multiple images with different exposures , and producing an hdr video image , by hymatom , licensee of georges cornuéjols ) , into an hdr image modern cmos image sensor can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure the wide dynamic range of the captured image is non-linearly compressed into a smaller dynamic range electronic representation such hdr imaging is used in extreme dynamic range applications like welding or automotive work in security cameras the term used instead of hdr is '' wide dynamic range ''

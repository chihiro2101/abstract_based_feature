tone mapping reduces the dynamic range , or contrast ratio , of an entire image while retaining localized contrast several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images notable titles include : adobe photoshop affinity photo aurora hdr dynamic photo hdr easyhdr gimp hdr photostudio luminance hdr nik collection hdr efex pro oloneo photoengine ptgui sns-hdr therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred the values stored for hdr images are often gamma correction ( power law ) or logarithmically encoded , or floating point linear values , since fixed-point linear encodings are increasingly inefficient over higher dynamic ranges hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range however , when the appropriate transfer function is used , hdr pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12 & nbsp ; bits for luminance and 8 & nbsp ; bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts le gray used one negative for the sky , and another one with a longer exposure for the sea , and combined the two into one picture in positive manual tone mapping was accomplished by dodging and burning & nbsp ; – selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction in feb 2001 , the dynamic ranger technique was demonstrated , using multiple photos with different exposure levels to accomplish high dynamic range similar to the naked eye in 2005 , adobe systems introduced several new features in photoshop cs2 including merge to hdr , 32 bit floating point image support , and hdr tone mapping modern cmos image sensor can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure in security cameras the term used instead of hdr is '' wide dynamic range '' some other cameras designed for use in security applications can automatically provide two or more images for each frame , with changing exposure

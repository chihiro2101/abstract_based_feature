tone mapping reduces the dynamic range , or contrast ratio , of an entire image while retaining localized contrast several software applications are available on the pc , mac and linux platforms for producing hdr files and tone mapped images notable titles include : adobe photoshop affinity photo aurora hdr dynamic photo hdr easyhdr gimp hdr photostudio luminance hdr nik collection hdr efex pro oloneo photoengine ptgui sns-hdr therefore , hdr image formats are often called scene-referred , in contrast to traditional digital images , which are device-referred or output-referred hdr images often do n't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range however , when the appropriate transfer function is used , hdr pixels for some applications can be represented with a color depth that has as few as 10–12 & nbsp ; bits for luminance and 8 & nbsp ; bits for chrominance without introducing any visible quantization artifacts le gray used one negative for the sky , and another one with a longer exposure for the sea , and combined the two into one picture in positive georges cornuéjols and licensees of his patents ( brdi , hymatom ) introduced the principle of hdr video image , in 1986 , by interposing a matricial lcd screen in front of the camera 's image sensor , increasing the sensors dynamic by five stops in february and april 1990 , georges cornuéjols introduced the first real-time hdr camera that combined two images captured by a sensor or simultaneously by two sensors of the camera also in 1991 , georges cornuéjols introduced the hdr+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images to increase the sensitivity of the camera : for low-light environments , several successive images are accumulated , thus increasing the signal to noise ratio modern hdr imaging uses a completely different approach , based on making a high-dynamic-range luminance or light map using only global image operations ( across the entire image ) , and then tone mapping the result the advent of consumer digital cameras produced a new demand for hdr imaging to improve the light response of digital camera sensors , which had a much smaller dynamic range than film modern cmos image sensor can often capture a high dynamic range from a single exposure in security cameras the term used instead of hdr is '' wide dynamic range ''

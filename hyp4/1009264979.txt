one view is that the word etna is from the greek αἴθω ( aithō ) , meaning '' i burn '' , through an iotacism pronunciation another view is that the name is derived from the phoenician word meaning '' furnace '' or '' chimney '' according to adrian room 's book place-names of the world , the name '' etna '' originated from the phoenician word meaning '' furnace '' or '' chimney '' in classical greek , it is called ( aítnē ) , a name given also to catania and the city originally known as inessa it is also known as muncibeḍḍu in sicilian and mongibello or montebello in italian ( the italian word literally means '' beautiful mountain '' ) another theory is that mongibello came from the italian word monte plus the arabic word jabal , both meaning '' mountain '' today , the name mongibello is used for the area of mount etna containing the two central craters , and the craters located southeast and northeast of the volcanic cone caesarius employs in his account the latin phrase in monte gyber ( '' within etna '' ) to describe the location of arthur 's kingdom loomis , roger sherman wales and the arthurian legend , pub , a spring ) – a circumstance more in keeping with morgan 's original watery , rather than fiery , associations , before her incorporation into the folklore of sicily most occur at the summit , where there are five distinct craters – the northeast crater , the voragine , the bocca nuova , and the southeast crater complex ( 2 ) since the year ad & nbsp ; 1600 , at least 60 flank eruptions and countless summit eruptions have occurred ; nearly half of these have happened since the start of the 20th century since 2000 , etna has had four flank eruptions – in 2001 , 2002–2003 , 2004–2005 , and 2008–2009 summit eruptions occurred in 2006 , 2007–2008 , january–april 2012 , in july–october 2012 , december 2018 and again in february 2021 volcanic activity first took place at etna about 500,000 years ago , with eruptions occurring beneath the sea off the ancient coastline of sicily about 300,000 & nbsp ; years ago , volcanism began occurring to the southwest of the summit ( centre top of the volcano ) , then activity moved towards the present centre 170,000 & nbsp ; years ago eruptions at this time built up the first major volcanic edifice , forming a stratovolcano in alternating explosive and effusive eruptions the growth of the mountain was occasionally interrupted by major eruptions , leading to the collapse of the summit to form calderas from about 35,000 to 15,000 & nbsp ; years ago , etna experienced some highly explosive eruptions , generating large pyroclastic flows , which left extensive ignimbrite deposits thousands of years ago , the eastern flank of the mountain experienced a catastrophic collapse , generating an enormous landslide in an event similar to that seen in the 1980 eruption of mount st research published in 2006 suggested this occurred around 8,000 years ago , and caused a huge tsunami , which left its mark in several places in the eastern mediterranean contrary to widespread reports of up to 15,000 ( or even 20,000 ) human fatalities caused by the lava , '' mount etna ( volcano , italy ) '' one possibility is confusion between this eruption and an earthquake that devastated southeast sicily ( including catania ) 24 years later in 1693 following six years ( 1995–2001 ) of unusually intense activity at the four summit craters of etna , the volcano produced its first flank eruption since 1991–1993 in july–august 2001 the eruption also completely destroyed the tourist station piano provenzana , on the northeastern flank of the volcano , and part of the tourist station '' etna sud '' around the rifugio sapienza on the south flank following a slow and non-destructive lava outflow on the upper southeastern flank between september 2004 and march 2005 , intense eruptions occurred at the southeast crater in july–december 2006 in 2014 , a flank eruption started involving lava flows and strombolian eruptions the activity continued on the following days , with an ash plume that reached in height that forced catania airport to shut down for a few hours in the 1970s etna erupted smoke rings , one of the first captured events of this type , which are extremely rare it runs around the volcano in a 110-km long semi-circle starting in catania and ending in riposto 28 & nbsp ; km north of catania

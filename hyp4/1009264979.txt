one view is that the word etna is from the greek αἴθω ( aithō ) , meaning '' i burn '' , through an iotacism pronunciation another view is that the name is derived from the phoenician word meaning '' furnace '' or '' chimney '' according to adrian room 's book place-names of the world , the name '' etna '' originated from the phoenician word meaning '' furnace '' or '' chimney '' he dismisses the hypothesis that 'etna ' has a greek derivation in classical greek , it is called ( aítnē ) , a name given also to catania and the city originally known as inessa it is also known as muncibeḍḍu in sicilian and mongibello or montebello in italian ( the italian word literally means '' beautiful mountain '' ) another theory is that mongibello came from the italian word monte plus the arabic word jabal , both meaning '' mountain '' today , the name mongibello is used for the area of mount etna containing the two central craters , and the craters located southeast and northeast of the volcanic cone caesarius quotes as his authority for the story a certain canon gottschalk of bonn , who considered it a matter of historical fact of the time of emperor henry 's conquest of sicily circa 1194 other eruptions occur on the flanks , which have more than 300 vents ranging in size from small holes in the ground to large craters hundreds of metres across in contrast , flank eruptions can occur down to a few hundred metres altitude , close to or even well within the inhabited areas since the year ad & nbsp ; 1600 , at least 60 flank eruptions and countless summit eruptions have occurred ; nearly half of these have happened since the start of the 20th century since 2000 , etna has had four flank eruptions – in 2001 , 2002–2003 , 2004–2005 , and 2008–2009 volcanic activity first took place at etna about 500,000 years ago , with eruptions occurring beneath the sea off the ancient coastline of sicily about 300,000 & nbsp ; years ago , volcanism began occurring to the southwest of the summit ( centre top of the volcano ) , then activity moved towards the present centre 170,000 & nbsp ; years ago research published in 2006 suggested this occurred around 8,000 years ago , and caused a huge tsunami , which left its mark in several places in the eastern mediterranean it has been suggested that this was the reason why the settlement of atlit yam ( israel ) , now below sea level , was suddenly abandoned around that time ( 2020 ) israel : submerged prehistoric sites and settlements on the mediterranean coastline—the current state of the art the most recent collapse event at the summit of etna is thought to have occurred about 2,000 & nbsp ; years ago , forming what is known as the piano caldera this caldera has been almost entirely filled by subsequent lava eruptions but is still visible as a distinct break in the slope of the mountain near the base of the present-day summit cone mount etna is moving towards the mediterranean sea at an average rate of per year , the massif sliding on an unconsolidated layer above the older sloping terrain gravitational collapse of mount etna ’ s southeastern flank in 396 & nbsp ; bc , an eruption of etna reportedly thwarted the carthaginians in their attempt to advance on syracuse during the second sicilian war to help with reconstruction after the devastating effects of the eruption , the roman government exempted the population of catania from paying taxes for ten years one possibility is confusion between this eruption and an earthquake that devastated southeast sicily ( including catania ) 24 years later in 1693 the eruption continued at a slowly diminishing rate for 417 days , until 6 july 2009 , making this the longest flank eruption of etna since the 1991–1993 eruption that lasted 473 days this was the first flank eruption since 2008–09 on 3 december 2015 , an eruption occurred which climaxed between 03:20 and 04:10 local time the activity continued on the following days , with an ash plume that reached in height that forced catania airport to shut down for a few hours an eruption on 24 december 2018 , following a dyke intrusion at shallow depth , spewed ash into the air , forcing the closure of airspace around mount etna list of volcanoes in italy genista aetnensis , the mount etna broom list of italian regions by highest point mount vesuvius sacred mountains volcanic seven summits

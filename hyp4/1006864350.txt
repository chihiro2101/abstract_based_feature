gottfried wilhelm leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) was both a philosopher and a mathematician who wrote primarily in latin and french leibniz , along with rené descartes and baruch spinoza , was one of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism the work of leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy , but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition , in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence it must be the best possible and most balanced world , because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing god , who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist in effect , apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world , because otherwise god would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws the monads are '' substantial forms of being '' with the following properties : they are eternal , indecomposable , individual , subject to their own laws , un-interacting , and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony ( a historically important example of panpsychism ) wolff was one of the first to use german as a language of scholarly instruction and research , although he also wrote in latin , so that an international audience could , and did , read him a founding father of , among other fields , economics and public administration as academic disciplines , he concentrated especially in these fields , giving advice on practical matters to people in government , and stressing the professional nature of university education in 1781 , immanuel kant ( 1724–1804 ) published his critique of pure reason , in which he attempted to determine what we can and can not know through the use of reason independent of all experience it follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience , but nothing else , but we can never know the world from the “ standpoint of nowhere ” and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety , neither via reason nor experience since the publication of his critique , immanuel kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy in the late 18th and early 19th century , one direct line of influence from kant is german idealism german idealism was a philosophical movement that emerged in germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the most prominent german idealists in the movement , besides kant , were johann gottlieb fichte ( 1762–1814 ) , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling ( 1775–1854 ) and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel ( 1770–1831 ) who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century german philosophy , and the proponents of jena romanticism ;

right hegelians among those influenced by hegel immediately after his death in 1831 two distinct groups can be roughly divided into the politically and religiously radical 'left ' , or 'young ' , hegelians and the more conservative 'right ' , or 'old ' , hegelians warren breckman , marx , the young hegelians , and the origins of radical social theory : dethroning the self , cambridge university press , 1999 , p ; young hegelians the young hegelians drew on hegel 's idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason ; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques , first of religion and then of the prussian political system they rejected anti-utopian aspects of his thought that '' old hegelians '' have interpreted to mean that the world has already essentially reached perfection they included ludwig feuerbach ( 1804–72 ) , david strauss ( 1808–74 ) , bruno bauer ( 1809–82 ) and max stirner ( 1806–56 ) among their ranks ) file : ludwig andreas feuerbach.jpg ludwig feuerbach ( 1804–72 ) file:1908 david-friedrich-strauss.jpg david strauss ( 1808–74 ) file : bruno bauer.jpg bruno bauer ( 1809–82 ) file : maxstirner1.svg max stirner ( 1806–56 ) file : karl marx 001.jpg karl marx ( 1818–83 ) 48 ( dover page 616 ) , '' the ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in early christianity , as it was developed in the writings of the desert fathers from the kernel of the new testament ; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards in the early part of the 20th century , a group of german and austrian philosophers and scientists formed the vienna circle to promote scientific thought over hegelian system-building , which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought it was then transformed by martin heidegger ( 1889–1976 ) , whose famous book being and time ( 1927 ) applied phenomenology to ontology , and who , along with ludwig wittgenstein , is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century in 1923 , carl grünberg founded the institute for social research , drawing from marxism , freud 's psychoanalysis and weberian philosophy , which came to be known as the '' frankfurt school '' goethe-institut list of german-language philosophers critical theory culture of germany german literature history of philosophy list of austrian intellectual traditions logical empiricism modern philosophy phenomenology postmodernism prussian virtues

gottfried wilhelm leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) was both a philosopher and a mathematician who wrote primarily in latin and french leibniz , along with rené descartes and baruch spinoza , was one of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism the work of leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy , but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition , in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence it must be the best possible and most balanced world , because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing god , who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist in effect , apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world , because otherwise god would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws the monads are '' substantial forms of being '' with the following properties : they are eternal , indecomposable , individual , subject to their own laws , un-interacting , and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony ( a historically important example of panpsychism ) christian wolff ( 1679–1754 ) was the most eminent german philosopher between leibniz and kant his main achievement was a complete oeuvre on almost every scholarly subject of his time , displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive , mathematical method , which perhaps represents the peak of enlightenment rationality in germany wolff was one of the first to use german as a language of scholarly instruction and research , although he also wrote in latin , so that an international audience could , and did , read him in 1781 , immanuel kant ( 1724–1804 ) published his critique of pure reason , in which he attempted to determine what we can and can not know through the use of reason independent of all experience since the publication of his critique , immanuel kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy in the late 18th and early 19th century , one direct line of influence from kant is german idealism german idealism was a philosophical movement that emerged in germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries beiser , german idealism : the struggle against subjectivism , 1781-1801 , harvard university press , 2002 , part i beiser , german idealism : the struggle against subjectivism , 1781-1801 , harvard university press , 2002 , p viii : '' the young romantics—hölderlin , schlegel , novalis—were crucial figures in the development of german idealism '' august ludwig hülsen , friedrich heinrich jacobi , gottlob ernst schulze , karl leonhard reinhold , salomon maimon , friedrich schleiermacher , and arthur schopenhauer also made major contributions file : johann gottlieb fichte.jpg johann gottlieb fichte ( 1762-1814 ) file : nb pinacoteca stieler friedrich wilhelm joseph von schelling.jpg friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling ( 1775-1854 ) file : hegel by schlesinger.jpg g karl marx and the young hegelians his influence has continued in contemporary philosophy but mainly in continental philosophy its proponents ( immanuel hermann fichte ( 1796–1879 ) , christian hermann weisse ( 1801–1866 ) , and hermann ulrici ( 1806–1884 ) kelly parker , krzysztof skowronski ( eds ) , josiah royce for the twenty-first century : historical , ethical , and religious interpretations , lexington books , 2012 , p they included ludwig feuerbach ( 1804–72 ) , david strauss ( 1808–74 ) , bruno bauer ( 1809–82 ) and max stirner ( 1806–56 ) among their ranks an idiosyncratic opponent of german idealism , particularly hegel 's thought , was arthur schopenhauer ( 1788 & nbsp ; –1860 ) beiser , weltschmerz : pessimism in german philosophy , 1860–1900 , oxford : oxford university press , 2016 , p however , he soon came to disavow schopenhauer 's pessimistic outlook on life and sought to provide a positive philosophy it was then transformed by martin heidegger ( 1889–1976 ) , whose famous book being and time ( 1927 ) applied phenomenology to ontology , and who , along with ludwig wittgenstein , is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century goethe-institut list of german-language philosophers critical theory culture of germany german literature history of philosophy list of austrian intellectual traditions logical empiricism modern philosophy phenomenology postmodernism prussian virtues

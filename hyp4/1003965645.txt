according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan thus , the ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the ainu from the ainu viewpoint , whereas it is exactly the opposite from the ryukyuans ' viewpoint who are closest to the yamato japanese according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) it is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions , with the divergence dated to the holocene , and without major genetic contribution of the pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day southern islanders an autosomal dna analysis from okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other japanese and east asian contemporary populations , sharing on average 80 % admixture with mainland japanese and 19 % admixture with chinese population , and that have isolate characteristics the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa the research on the contemporary okinawan male y chromosome showed , in 2006 ; 55.6 % of haplogroup d-p-m55 , 22.2 % o-p31 , 15.6 % o-m122 , 4.4 % c-m8 , and 2.2 % others the haplogroup o began its expansion circa 4,000-3,810 years ago , and thus the haplogroups d-m55 and c-m8 belong to the jomon 's male lineage , and haplogroup o belongs to the yayoi 's male lineage this rare haplogroup was detected only in yamato japanese , koreans , and tibetans , with the highest frequency and diversity in tibet the comparative studies on the dental diversity also showed long-term gene flow from outside source ( main-island honshu and from the southern part of east asia ) , long-term isolation , and genetic drift which produced the morphological diversification of the modern ryukyuans , ainu ) and the ryukyuans , although several genetic , cranial , dental analyses , and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship , while according to anthropological data are consistently between the yamato japanese and ainu people a recent craniometric study shows that the ryukyuan people are closely related to the yamato people and their common main ancestors , the yayoi people the ryukyuans differ strongly from jōmon and ainu people , which , according to the authors , is a strong evidence for the replacement of jōmon-related groups by the ancestors of the ryukyuans during the jōmon period ( i.e the southern ryukyus culture was isolated from the northern , and its shimotabaru period ( 4,500–3,000 ybp ) was characterized by a specific style of pottery , and the aceramic period ( 2,500–800 ybp ) , during which no pottery was produced in this region their prehistoric yaeyama culture showed some intermingled affinities with southern indonesian and melanesian cultures , broadly , that the sakishima islands have some traces similar to the southeast asian and south pacific cultures the finding of ancient chinese knife money near naha in okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient chinese state yan as early as the 3rd century bce according to the shan hai jing , the yan had relations with the wa ( dwarf , short ) people living southeast of korea , who could be related to both the mainland japanese or ryukyuan people the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century emperor yang of sui , due to previous tradition , between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the '' land of happy immortals '' as the chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other , and the islanders did not want to accept the sui rule and suzerainty , the chinese envoy took many captives back to the court nihongi recorded that the hayato people in southern kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century in 699 are mentioned islands amami and tokara , in 714 shingaki and kume , in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the japanese capital nara , and at last okinawa in 753 the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa during the rule of eiso 's great-grandson , tamagusuku ( 1314–1336 ) , okinawa became divided into three polities and began the so-called sanzan period ( 1314–1429 ) in the next two decades chūzan made nine official missions to the chinese capital , and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 ( see imperial chinese missions to ryukyu kingdom ) despite significant chinese economical , cultural and political influence , the polities continued to maintain strong autonomy as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china in 1392 , 36 chinese families from fujian were invited by the chieftain of okinawa island 's central polity ( chūzan ) to settle near the port of naha and to serve as diplomats , interpreters , and government officials some consider that many ryukyuan officials were descended from these chinese immigrants , being born in china or having chinese grandfathers they assisted the ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations the period of shō shin 's ( 1477–1526 ) rule , descendant from the second shō dynasty , is notable for peace and relative prosperity , peak in overseas trade , as well as expansion of the kingdom 's firm control to kikaijima , miyako-jima and yaeyama islands ( 1465–1524 ) , while during shō sei ( 1526-1555 ) to amami ōshima ( 1537 ) after the kyūshū campaign ( 1586–1587 ) by toyotomi hideyoshi , his assistant kamei korenori , who was interested in southern trade , wanted to be rewarded with the ryukyu islands a paper fan found during the japanese invasions of korea ( 1592–98 ) mentioning a title '' kamei , lord of ryukyu '' , reveals that hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands in 1591 , kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands , but the shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the ryukyu kingdom the amami islands became part of shimazu 's territory , taxes were imposed , making them subordinate in the relations between japan and china sessei shō shōken ( 1666–1673 ) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation , and affairs like sugarcane production , and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production the relations with qing dynasty improved after their second mission when the first ryukyuan official students were sent to china in 1688 during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan in 1875 , the ryukyuan people were forced to terminate their tributary relations with china , against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both china and japan , something a then-weakened china was unable to stop grant for a sovereign okinawa and the division of the other islands between china and japan was rejected , with a last-minute decision by the chinese government not to ratify the agreement rendering it null ryukyuans often faced prejudice , humiliation in the workplace and ethnic discrimination , with the ryukyuan elite divided into factions either in support of or in opposition to assimilation between 1920 and 1921 , a fall in sugar prices , as well as the transfer of japan 's sugar production to taiwan , led to ryukyu being the poorest prefecture , despite having the heaviest taxation burden ; the drop in sugar prices would continue into 1931 , further worsening the situation the ryukyuan language is divided into two main groups , northern ryukyuan languages and southern ryukyuan languages , and generally are considered the existence of five ryukyuan languages ; amami , okinawa , miyako , yaeyama and yonaguni , while the sixth kunigami is added due to diversity from 1907 , the children were prohibited to speak ryukyuan languages in school , and since the mid-1930s there existed dialect cards , a system of punishment for the students who spoke in a non-standard language in the 1920s was ordered building of shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with shinto architectural symbols , paid by local tax money , which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated okinawa 's economy most famous to tourists is the momordica charantia , gōya ( bitter melon ) , which is often mixed into a representative okinawan stir fry dish known as chanpuru ( goya champuru )

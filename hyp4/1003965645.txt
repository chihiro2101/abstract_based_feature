their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) within the japanese population the ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island honshu the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) it is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions , with the divergence dated to the holocene , and without major genetic contribution of the pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day southern islanders an autosomal dna analysis from okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other japanese and east asian contemporary populations , sharing on average 80 % admixture with mainland japanese and 19 % admixture with chinese population , and that have isolate characteristics the haplogroups d and c are considered of paleolithic origin , with coalescence time of c 14,500 ybp and 10,820 ybp respectively , and were isolated for thousands of years once land bridges between japan and continental asia disappeared at the end of the last glacial maximum c , ainu ) and the ryukyuans , although several genetic , cranial , dental analyses , and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship , while according to anthropological data are consistently between the yamato japanese and ainu people a recent craniometric study shows that the ryukyuan people are closely related to the yamato people and their common main ancestors , the yayoi people the ryukyu islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago , but their fate and relation with contemporary ryukyuan people is uncertain , kaizuka ) or so-called shell midden period ( 6,700-1,000 ybp ) of the northern ryukyus , the population lived in a hunter-gatherer society , with similar mainland jōmon pottery some scholars consider that the language and cultural influence was more far-reaching than blending of race and physical types the southern ryukyus culture was isolated from the northern , and its shimotabaru period ( 4,500–3,000 ybp ) was characterized by a specific style of pottery , and the aceramic period ( 2,500–800 ybp ) , during which no pottery was produced in this region the amami islands seem to be the islands with the most mainland japanese influence however , both north and south ryukyus were culturally unified in the 10th century according to the shan hai jing , the yan had relations with the wa ( dwarf , short ) people living southeast of korea , who could be related to both the mainland japanese or ryukyuan people the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century as the chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other , and the islanders did not want to accept the sui rule and suzerainty , the chinese envoy took many captives back to the court the islands , by the chinese named liuqiu , would be pronounced by the japanese as ryukyu in 616 the japanese annals for the first time mention the '' southern islands people '' , and for the half-century were noted some intruders from yaku and tanu nihongi recorded that the hayato people in southern kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century image : nakijinjyousi2.jpg thumb right the gusuku fortification are on the gusuku sites and related properties of the kingdom of ryukyu unesco 's list the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa however , the 24th throne was usurped from one of tenson 's descendants by a man named riyu , who was defeated in revolt led by shunten ( 1187 – 1237 ) , lord of urasoe after the years of famine and epidemic during the gihon 's rule , eiso introduced regular taxation system ( of weapons , grains and cloth ) in 1264 and as the government gained strength , the control extended from okinawa toward the islands of kume , kerama , iheya , and amami ōshima ( 1266 ) to eiso 's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of buddhism into okinawa during the rule of eiso 's great-grandson , tamagusuku ( 1314–1336 ) , okinawa became divided into three polities and began the so-called sanzan period ( 1314–1429 ) in this period another rapid economical , social and cultural development of ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with japan , korea and china during the satto 's reign , chūzan made tributary relations with china 's ming dynasty in 1374 as the hongwu emperor sent envoys in 1372 to okinawa as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china in 1392 , 36 chinese families from fujian were invited by the chieftain of okinawa island 's central polity ( chūzan ) to settle near the port of naha and to serve as diplomats , interpreters , and government officials the tributary relationship with china later became a basis of the 19th century sino-japanese disputes about the claims of okinawa in 1591 , kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands , but the shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the ryukyu kingdom in the early 17th century during the tokugawa shogunate ( 1603–1867 ) , the first shōgun tokugawa ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with china , and in 1603 ordered the ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate as the king did not react , with the instruction of the shōgun , the satsuma domain of the shimazu clan in kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom 's territory during the 1609 invasion of ryukyu the amami islands became part of shimazu 's territory , taxes were imposed , making them subordinate in the relations between japan and china until the invasion , the shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the '' lords of the twelve southern islands '' or '' southern islands '' , although initially meaning the near kyushu islands , then covering all the ryukyu islands from 1609 the ryukyuan missions to edo started which lasted until 1850 during the rule of kings shō shitsu ( 1648–1668 ) and shō tei ( 1669–1709 ) i.e the production was encouraged because satsuma 's annual tax deprived ryukyu 's internal resources the agricultural reforms especially continued under king shō kei ( 1713–1752 ) and his sanshikan advisor sai on ( 1728–1752 ) whose nomucho ( directory of agricultural affairs ) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century in the first half of the 19th century , french politicians like jean-baptiste cécille unsuccessfully tried to conclude a french trade treaty with ryukyu , with only a promise by shuri government about the admission of christian missionaries maintained control even after the 1951 treaty of san francisco , which went into effect on april 28 , 1952 , as the usmmgr was replaced by the united states civil administration of the ryukyu islands ( 1950–1972 ) negative feelings toward the mainland government , emperor ( especially hirohito due to his

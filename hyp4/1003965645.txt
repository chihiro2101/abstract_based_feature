their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) within the japanese population the ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island honshu the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan thus , the ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the ainu from the ainu viewpoint , whereas it is exactly the opposite from the ryukyuans ' viewpoint who are closest to the yamato japanese according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) it is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions , with the divergence dated to the holocene , and without major genetic contribution of the pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day southern islanders the amami islanders are also slightly more similar to the mainland population than the okinawa islanders an autosomal dna analysis from okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other japanese and east asian contemporary populations , sharing on average 80 % admixture with mainland japanese and 19 % admixture with chinese population , and that have isolate characteristics the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa the haplogroups d and c are considered of paleolithic origin , with coalescence time of c however , the analysis contradicts the idea of direct genetic continuity and affinity between the jomon ( i.e , ainu ) and the ryukyuans , although several genetic , cranial , dental analyses , and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship , while according to anthropological data are consistently between the yamato japanese and ainu people the ryukyu islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago , but their fate and relation with contemporary ryukyuan people is uncertain the southern ryukyus culture was isolated from the northern , and its shimotabaru period ( 4,500–3,000 ybp ) was characterized by a specific style of pottery , and the aceramic period ( 2,500–800 ybp ) , during which no pottery was produced in this region their prehistoric yaeyama culture showed some intermingled affinities with southern indonesian and melanesian cultures , broadly , that the sakishima islands have some traces similar to the southeast asian and south pacific cultures the amami islands seem to be the islands with the most mainland japanese influence the finding of ancient chinese knife money near naha in okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient chinese state yan as early as the 3rd century bce it is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress pimeku , her death and successive conflict , is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient matriarchy the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century according to shoku nihongi , in 698 a small force dispatched by japanese government successfully claimed the tane-jima , yakushima , amami , tokunoshima and other islands nihongi recorded that the hayato people in southern kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century in 699 are mentioned islands amami and tokara , in 714 shingaki and kume , in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the japanese capital nara , and at last okinawa in 753 image : nakijinjyousi2.jpg thumb right the gusuku fortification are on the gusuku sites and related properties of the kingdom of ryukyu unesco 's list shunten dynasty made two additional chieftains , shunbajunki ( 1237-1248 ) and gihon ( 1248–1259 ) as the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland , the period is named after many gusuku , castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places between 1272 and 1274 , as the mongol invasions of japan began , okinawa on two occasions rejected the mongols ' authority demands during the satto 's reign , chūzan made tributary relations with china 's ming dynasty in 1374 as the hongwu emperor sent envoys in 1372 to okinawa in 1392 , all three polities began to send extensive missions to the korean joseon kingdom in 1403 , chūzan made formal relations with the japanese ashikaga shogunate , and an embassy was sent to thailand in 1409 as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china some consider that many ryukyuan officials were descended from these chinese immigrants , being born in china or having chinese grandfathers in 1591 , kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands , but the shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the ryukyu kingdom as the ming 's influence weakened due to disorder in china , japanese established posts in southeast asia , and the europeans ( spanish and portuguese ) arrived , the kingdom 's overseas trade began to decline in the early 17th century during the tokugawa shogunate ( 1603–1867 ) , the first shōgun tokugawa ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with china , and in 1603 ordered the ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate as the king did not react , with the instruction of the shōgun , the satsuma domain of the shimazu clan in kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom 's territory during the 1609 invasion of ryukyu the amami islands became part of shimazu 's territory , taxes were imposed , making them subordinate in the relations between japan and china in the sakishima islands great part of the tax was paid in textiles made of ramie during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan in 1875 , the ryukyuan people were forced to terminate their tributary relations with china , against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both china and japan , something a then-weakened china was unable to stop members of the ryukyuan aristocratic classes such as kōchi chōjō and rin seikō continued to resist annexation for almost two decades ; however , following the first sino-japanese war ( 1894-1895 ) , both chinese and ryukyuan interest in sovereignty faded as china renounced its claims to the island ryukyuans often faced prejudice , humiliation in the workplace and ethnic discrimination , with the ryukyuan elite divided into factions either in support of or in opposition to assimilation as a result of the ensuing economic crisis , many people were forced to either find work in japan ( often osaka and kobe ) or abroad in taiwan during world war ii and battles like the battle of okinawa ( 1945 ) , approximately 150,000 civilians ( 1/3 of the population ) were killed in okinawa alone after the war , the ryukyu islands were occupied by the united states military government of the ryukyu islands ( 1945–1950 ) , but the u.s military rape incident , and by 110,000 people in 2007 due to the japanese ministry of education 's textbook revisions ( see mext controversy ) which critics say downplays the involvement of the japanese military in the forced mass suicide of the civilians during the battle of okinawa 1000 bce ) represents the formative period of the contemporary japanese people , it is argued that the japonic languages are related to the yayoi migrants additionally , since being under japanese control , shinto and buddhism are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs

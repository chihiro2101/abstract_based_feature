their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) within the japanese population the ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island honshu the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan thus , the ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the ainu from the ainu viewpoint , whereas it is exactly the opposite from the ryukyuans ' viewpoint who are closest to the yamato japanese according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) the amami islanders are also slightly more similar to the mainland population than the okinawa islanders an autosomal dna analysis from okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other japanese and east asian contemporary populations , sharing on average 80 % admixture with mainland japanese and 19 % admixture with chinese population , and that have isolate characteristics the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa the research on the contemporary okinawan male y chromosome showed , in 2006 ; 55.6 % of haplogroup d-p-m55 , 22.2 % o-p31 , 15.6 % o-m122 , 4.4 % c-m8 , and 2.2 % others the haplogroup o began its expansion circa 4,000-3,810 years ago , and thus the haplogroups d-m55 and c-m8 belong to the jomon 's male lineage , and haplogroup o belongs to the yayoi 's male lineage , ainu ) and the ryukyuans , although several genetic , cranial , dental analyses , and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship , while according to anthropological data are consistently between the yamato japanese and ainu people a recent craniometric study shows that the ryukyuan people are closely related to the yamato people and their common main ancestors , the yayoi people the ryukyuans differ strongly from jōmon and ainu people , which , according to the authors , is a strong evidence for the replacement of jōmon-related groups by the ancestors of the ryukyuans the ryukyu islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago , but their fate and relation with contemporary ryukyuan people is uncertain in the latter part of jōmon period , archaeological sites moved near the seashore , suggesting the engagement of people in fishery it is considered that from the latter half of jōmon period , the ryukyu islands developed their own culture their prehistoric yaeyama culture showed some intermingled affinities with southern indonesian and melanesian cultures , broadly , that the sakishima islands have some traces similar to the southeast asian and south pacific cultures the amami islands seem to be the islands with the most mainland japanese influence the finding of ancient chinese knife money near naha in okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient chinese state yan as early as the 3rd century bce the futile search for the elixir of immortality by qin shi huang , the founder of qin dynasty ( 221 bc–206 bc ) , in which the emperor tried to cooperate with '' happy immortals '' who dwelt on the islands , could be related to both japan and ryukyu islands the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century the islands , by the chinese named liuqiu , would be pronounced by the japanese as ryukyu in 616 the japanese annals for the first time mention the '' southern islands people '' , and for the half-century were noted some intruders from yaku and tanu during the rule of eiso 's great-grandson , tamagusuku ( 1314–1336 ) , okinawa became divided into three polities and began the so-called sanzan period ( 1314–1429 ) in this period another rapid economical , social and cultural development of ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with japan , korea and china during the satto 's reign , chūzan made tributary relations with china 's ming dynasty in 1374 as the hongwu emperor sent envoys in 1372 to okinawa in 1392 , all three polities began to send extensive missions to the korean joseon kingdom in 1403 , chūzan made formal relations with the japanese ashikaga shogunate , and an embassy was sent to thailand in 1409 as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china in 1392 , 36 chinese families from fujian were invited by the chieftain of okinawa island 's central polity ( chūzan ) to settle near the port of naha and to serve as diplomats , interpreters , and government officials some consider that many ryukyuan officials were descended from these chinese immigrants , being born in china or having chinese grandfathers the tributary relationship with china later became a basis of the 19th century sino-japanese disputes about the claims of okinawa after the kyūshū campaign ( 1586–1587 ) by toyotomi hideyoshi , his assistant kamei korenori , who was interested in southern trade , wanted to be rewarded with the ryukyu islands in 1591 , kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands , but the shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the ryukyu kingdom as the king did not react , with the instruction of the shōgun , the satsuma domain of the shimazu clan in kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom 's territory during the 1609 invasion of ryukyu they nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to ming 's prohibition of trade with the shogunate , but forbade them trade with other countries except china until the invasion , the shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the '' lords of the twelve southern islands '' or '' southern islands '' , although initially meaning the near kyushu islands , then covering all the ryukyu islands during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan this method of gradual integration was designed to avoid both ryukyuan and chinese protests , with the ruling shuri castle unaware of the significance of these developments , including japan 's decision to grant political representation to the ryukyuan islanders involved in the japanese invasion of taiwan ( 1874 ) in 1875 , the ryukyuan people were forced to terminate their tributary relations with china , against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both china and japan , something a then-weakened china was unable to stop grant for a sovereign okinawa and the division of the other islands between china and japan was rejected , with a last-minute decision by the chinese government not to ratify the agreement rendering it null on three occasions between 1875 and 1879 , the last ryukyuan king , shō tai , refused to submit to the demands placed upon his people , and in 1879 , his domain was formally abolished and established as okinawa prefecture , forcing his move to tokyo with the reduced status of viscount ryukyuans often faced prejudice , humiliation in the workplace and ethnic discrimination , with the ryukyuan elite divided into factions either in support of or in opposition to assimilation as a result of the ensuing economic crisis , many people were forced to either find work in japan ( often osaka and kobe ) or abroad in taiwan 250–538 ) , while mainland proto-ryukyuan was in contact with early middle japanese until 13th century thus , the ryukyuan languages constitute a cluster of local dialects termed as unroofed abstand languages , '' unroofed '' meaning without written standard the foremost account , which claimed common origin between the japanese and ryukyuan people , was made-up by shō shōken in the 17th century , to end up the pilgrimage of the ryukyu king and chief priestess to the kudaka island history of the ryukyu islands ryukyu independence movement ryukyuan culture ethnic issues in japan okinawa prefecture ryukyuan diaspora okinawans in hawaii ryukyuans in brazil ryukyuan americans

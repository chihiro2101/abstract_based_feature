their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan thus , the ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the ainu from the ainu viewpoint , whereas it is exactly the opposite from the ryukyuans ' viewpoint who are closest to the yamato japanese according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) it is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions , with the divergence dated to the holocene , and without major genetic contribution of the pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day southern islanders an autosomal dna analysis from okinawan samples concluded that they are most closely related to other japanese and east asian contemporary populations , sharing on average 80 % admixture with mainland japanese and 19 % admixture with chinese population , and that have isolate characteristics the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa the ryukyuans differ strongly from jōmon and ainu people , which , according to the authors , is a strong evidence for the replacement of jōmon-related groups by the ancestors of the ryukyuans in the latter part of jōmon period , archaeological sites moved near the seashore , suggesting the engagement of people in fishery it is considered that from the latter half of jōmon period , the ryukyu islands developed their own culture according to the shan hai jing , the yan had relations with the wa ( dwarf , short ) people living southeast of korea , who could be related to both the mainland japanese or ryukyuan people however , when the japanese diplomat ono no imoko arrived at the chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of yaku south of kyushu in 616 the japanese annals for the first time mention the '' southern islands people '' , and for the half-century were noted some intruders from yaku and tanu according to shoku nihongi , in 698 a small force dispatched by japanese government successfully claimed the tane-jima , yakushima , amami , tokunoshima and other islands in 699 are mentioned islands amami and tokara , in 714 shingaki and kume , in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the japanese capital nara , and at last okinawa in 753 the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa however , the 24th throne was usurped from one of tenson 's descendants by a man named riyu , who was defeated in revolt led by shunten ( 1187 – 1237 ) , lord of urasoe 900-950 ce , okinawans made significant political , social and economical growth as the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland , the period is named after many gusuku , castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places this period is also notable , compared to mainland japan , for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice , wheat , millet and the overseas trading of these goods , as well during shubanjunki 's rule the introduction of japanese kana writing system in its older and simple phonetic form after the years of famine and epidemic during the gihon 's rule , eiso introduced regular taxation system ( of weapons , grains and cloth ) in 1264 and as the government gained strength , the control extended from okinawa toward the islands of kume , kerama , iheya , and amami ōshima ( 1266 ) between 1272 and 1274 , as the mongol invasions of japan began , okinawa on two occasions rejected the mongols ' authority demands during the satto 's reign , chūzan made tributary relations with china 's ming dynasty in 1374 as the hongwu emperor sent envoys in 1372 to okinawa the contacts with siam continued even in 1425 , and were newly made with places like palembang in 1428 , java in 1430 , malacca and sumatra in 1463 as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china some consider that many ryukyuan officials were descended from these chinese immigrants , being born in china or having chinese grandfathers the tributary relationship with china later became a basis of the 19th century sino-japanese disputes about the claims of okinawa after the kyūshū campaign ( 1586–1587 ) by toyotomi hideyoshi , his assistant kamei korenori , who was interested in southern trade , wanted to be rewarded with the ryukyu islands in 1591 , kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands , but the shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the ryukyu kingdom hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of korea was more important in his mind as the ming 's influence weakened due to disorder in china , japanese established posts in southeast asia , and the europeans ( spanish and portuguese ) arrived , the kingdom 's overseas trade began to decline in the early 17th century during the tokugawa shogunate ( 1603–1867 ) , the first shōgun tokugawa ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with china , and in 1603 ordered the ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate as the king did not react , with the instruction of the shōgun , the satsuma domain of the shimazu clan in kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom 's territory during the 1609 invasion of ryukyu until the invasion , the shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the '' lords of the twelve southern islands '' or '' southern islands '' , although initially meaning the near kyushu islands , then covering all the ryukyu islands sessei shō shōken ( 1666–1673 ) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation , and affairs like sugarcane production , and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production the agricultural reforms especially continued under king shō kei ( 1713–1752 ) and his sanshikan advisor sai on ( 1728–1752 ) whose nomucho ( directory of agricultural affairs ) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century in the first half of the 19th century , french politicians like jean-baptiste cécille unsuccessfully tried to conclude a french trade treaty with ryukyu , with only a promise by shuri government about the admission of christian missionaries during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan this method of gradual integration was designed to avoid both ryukyuan and chinese protests , with the ruling shuri castle unaware of the significance of these developments , including japan 's decision to grant political representation to the ryukyuan islanders involved in the japanese invasion of taiwan ( 1874 ) in 1875 , the ryukyuan people were forced to terminate their tributary relations with china , against their preference for a state of dual allegiance to both china and japan , something a then-weakened china was unable to stop grant for a sovereign okinawa and the division of the other islands between china and japan was rejected , with a last-minute decision by the chinese government not to ratify the agreement rendering it null many historians criticise meiji-era japan 's characterisation of the process as being considered a relatively simple administrative change , rather than the creation of japan 's first colony and the beginning of its 'inner colonialism ' around and especially after the japanese annexation of taiwan in 1895 , japan 's developmental focus shifted away from okinawa , resulting in a period of famine known as ( '' cycad hell '' ) as a result of the ensuing economic crisis , many people were forced to either find work in japan ( often osaka and kobe ) or abroad in taiwan previously ideologically considered by the japanese scholars as a dialect and descendant from the old japanese language , the ryukyuan languages are a sister and mutually unintelligible branch of japanese and sometime hachijō language , and a branch of japonic languages it is considered that contemporary people older than 85 exclusively use ryukyuan , between 45 and 85 use ryukyuan and standard japanese depending on family or working environment , younger than 45 are able to understand ryukyuan , while younger than 30 mainly are not able to understand nor speak ryukyuan languages from the chinese traditional instrument sanxian in the 16th century developed the okinawan instrument sanshin from which ultimately derives kankara sanshin and

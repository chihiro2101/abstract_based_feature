their usual ethnic name derives from the chinese name for the islands , '' liuqiu '' ( also spelled as loo choo , lew chew , luchu , and more ) , which in the japanese language is pronounced '' ryuukyuu '' according to the recent genetic studies , the ryukyuan people share more alleles with the jōmon period ( 16,000–3,000 years ago ) hunter-gatherers and ainu people than the yamato people , have smaller genetic contributions from asian continental populations , which supports the dual-structure model of k hanihara ( 1991 ) , a widely accepted theory which suggests that the yamato japanese are more admixed with asian agricultural continental people ( from the korean peninsula ) than the ainu and the ryukyuans , with major admixture occurring in and after the yayoi period ( 3,000-1,700 years ago ) the admixture event which formed the admixed ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago , which corresponds to the gusuku period , and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from japan thus , the ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the ainu from the ainu viewpoint , whereas it is exactly the opposite from the ryukyuans ' viewpoint who are closest to the yamato japanese according to archaeological evidence , there 's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the northern ryukyu islands ( amami islands and okinawa islands ) and the southern ryukyu islands ( miyako islands and yaeyama islands ) it is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions , with the divergence dated to the holocene , and without major genetic contribution of the pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day southern islanders the amami islanders are also slightly more similar to the mainland population than the okinawa islanders the research on the skeletal remains from the neolithic shell midden period ( also known as kaizuka period ) in okinawa , as well from the gusuku period , showed predominance of female haplogroups d4 and m7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of okinawa the haplogroup o began its expansion circa 4,000-3,810 years ago , and thus the haplogroups d-m55 and c-m8 belong to the jomon 's male lineage , and haplogroup o belongs to the yayoi 's male lineage the comparative studies on the dental diversity also showed long-term gene flow from outside source ( main-island honshu and from the southern part of east asia ) , long-term isolation , and genetic drift which produced the morphological diversification of the modern ryukyuans , ainu ) and the ryukyuans , although several genetic , cranial , dental analyses , and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship , while according to anthropological data are consistently between the yamato japanese and ainu people a recent craniometric study shows that the ryukyuan people are closely related to the yamato people and their common main ancestors , the yayoi people the ryukyu islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago , but their fate and relation with contemporary ryukyuan people is uncertain during the jōmon period ( i.e it is considered that from the latter half of jōmon period , the ryukyu islands developed their own culture the amami islands seem to be the islands with the most mainland japanese influence the finding of ancient chinese knife money near naha in okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient chinese state yan as early as the 3rd century bce the first certain mention of the islands and its people by the chinese and japanese is dated in the 7th century according to shoku nihongi , in 698 a small force dispatched by japanese government successfully claimed the tane-jima , yakushima , amami , tokunoshima and other islands nihongi recorded that the hayato people in southern kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century nevertheless the mention or authority , over the centuries the japanese influence spread slowly among the communities image : nakijinjyousi2.jpg thumb right the gusuku fortification are on the gusuku sites and related properties of the kingdom of ryukyu unesco 's list the lack of written record resulted with later , 17th century royal tales both under chinese and japanese influence , which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the '' divine right '' of their royal authority , as well the then-political interests of tokugawa shōguns from minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize japanese domination over okinawa after the years of famine and epidemic during the gihon 's rule , eiso introduced regular taxation system ( of weapons , grains and cloth ) in 1264 and as the government gained strength , the control extended from okinawa toward the islands of kume , kerama , iheya , and amami ōshima ( 1266 ) the central chūzan polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle towns and harbor facilities in 1392 , all three polities began to send extensive missions to the korean joseon kingdom the contacts with siam continued even in 1425 , and were newly made with places like palembang in 1428 , java in 1430 , malacca and sumatra in 1463 as in 1371 , china initiated its maritime prohibition policy ( haijin ) to japan , ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between japan and china they shipped horses , sulphur and seashells to china , from china brought ceramics , copper , and iron , from southeast asian countries bought tin , ivory , spices ( pepper ) , wood ( sappanwood ) , which they sold to japan , korea or china , as well as transporting chinese goods to hakata bay from where swords , silver and gold were brought the tributary relationship with china later became a basis of the 19th century sino-japanese disputes about the claims of okinawa after the kyūshū campaign ( 1586–1587 ) by toyotomi hideyoshi , his assistant kamei korenori , who was interested in southern trade , wanted to be rewarded with the ryukyu islands a paper fan found during the japanese invasions of korea ( 1592–98 ) mentioning a title '' kamei , lord of ryukyu '' , reveals that hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had no legitimate claim upon the islands as the ming 's influence weakened due to disorder in china , japanese established posts in southeast asia , and the europeans ( spanish and portuguese ) arrived , the kingdom 's overseas trade began to decline they nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to ming 's prohibition of trade with the shogunate , but forbade them trade with other countries except china until the invasion , the shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the '' lords of the twelve southern islands '' or '' southern islands '' , although initially meaning the near kyushu islands , then covering all the ryukyu islands sessei shō shōken ( 1666–1673 ) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation , and affairs like sugarcane production , and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production the relations with qing dynasty improved after their second mission when the first ryukyuan official students were sent to china in 1688 however , due to extreme measures in teaching , bernard jean bettelheim 's propagation of protestantism between 1846–1854 was obscured by the government during the meiji period ( 1868–1912 ) the process began , according to which the ryukyuan kingdom came under the jurisdiction of kagoshima prefecture in 1871 , encompassing the southern tip of kyushu and the ryukyuan islands to its south ; this created the ryukyu domain ( 1872–1879 ) of meiji-era japan this method of gradual integration was designed to avoid both ryukyuan and chinese protests , with the ruling shuri castle unaware of the significance of these developments , including japan 's decision to grant political representation to the ryukyuan islanders involved in the japanese invasion of taiwan ( 1874 ) grant for a sovereign okinawa and the division of the other islands between china and japan was rejected , with a last-minute decision by the chinese government not to ratify the agreement rendering it null during the meiji period , as with the ainu people of hokkaido , the ryukyuan people had their own culture , religion , traditions and language suppressed by the meiji government in the face of forced assimilation from the 1880s onwards , schools forbade the display of ryukyuan styles of dress , hairstyles and other visual aspects , considering them to be backwards and inferior , with students forced to wear japanese clothing and to assimilate into japanese culture indoctrination into a militaristic and emperor-centred ideology for children began from the age of beginning elementary school onwards ; the ultimate goal of this education was a total unification of the ryukyuan people into the yamato people , embodying the ideal of ethnic purity , with contemporary literature for the time ignoring japan 's minorities ryukyuans often faced prejudice , humiliation in the workplace and ethnic discrimination , with the ryukyuan elite divided into factions either in support of or in opposition to assimilation between 1920 and 1921 , a fall in sugar prices , as well as the transfer of japan 's sugar production to taiwan , led to ryukyu being the poorest prefecture , despite having the heaviest taxation burden ; the drop in sugar prices would continue into 1931 , further worsening the situation as a result of the ensuing economic crisis , many people were forced to either find work in japan ( often osaka and kobe ) or abroad in taiwan the foremost account , which claimed common origin between the japanese and ryukyuan people , was made-up by shō shōken in the 17th century , to end up the pilgrimage of the ryukyu king and chief priestess to the kudaka island

alfvén received his phd from the university of uppsala in 1934 in 1934 , alfvén taught physics at both the university of uppsala and the nobel institute for physics ( later renamed the manne siegbahn institute of physics ) in stockholm , sweden in 1940 , he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the royal institute of technology in stockholm from 1954 to 1955 , alfvén was a fulbright scholar at the university of maryland , college park in 1967 , after leaving sweden and spending time in the soviet union , he moved to the united states alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the university of california , san diego and the university of southern california in 1991 , alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the university of california , san diego and professor of plasma physics at the royal institute of technology in stockholm in 1937 , alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe , it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field hannes alfvén , 1937 '' cosmic radiation as an intra-galactic phenomenon '' , ark space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances his theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora ( based on earlier work by kristian birkeland ) was confirmed in 1967 , these currents now being known as birkeland currents alfvén 's disagreements with chapman stemmed in large part from trouble with the peer review system alfvén recalled : when i describe plasma phenomena according to this formalism most referees do not understand what i say and turn down my papers with the referee system which rules us science today , this means that my papers are rarely accepted by the leading us journals hannes alfvén , '' double layers and circuits in astrophysics '' ( 1986 ) ieee transactions on plasma science ( issn 0093-3813 ) , vol the relationships between hans-jürgen treder , hannes alfvén and wilfried schröder were discussed in detail by schröder in his publications the composer hugo alfvén was hannes alfvén 's uncle cosmic plasma , astrophysics and space science library , vol

in 1934 , alfvén taught physics at both the university of uppsala and the nobel institute for physics ( later renamed the manne siegbahn institute of physics ) in stockholm , sweden in 1940 , he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the royal institute of technology in stockholm alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the university of california , san diego and the university of southern california in 1991 , alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the university of california , san diego and professor of plasma physics at the royal institute of technology in stockholm alfvén spent his later adult life alternating between california and sweden in 1937 , alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe , it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field hannes alfvén , 1937 '' cosmic radiation as an intra-galactic phenomenon '' , ark the currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents his theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora ( based on earlier work by kristian birkeland ) was confirmed in 1967 , these currents now being known as birkeland currents alfvén 's work was disputed for many years by the senior scientist in space physics , the british mathematician and geophysics sydney chapman alfvén 's disagreements with chapman stemmed in large part from trouble with the peer review system hannes alfvén , '' double layers and circuits in astrophysics '' ( 1986 ) ieee transactions on plasma science ( issn 0093-3813 ) , vol alfvén believed the problem with the big bang was that astrophysicists tried to extrapolate the origin of the universe from mathematical theory developed on the blackboard , rather than starting from known observable phenomena alfvén and colleagues proposed the alfvén–klein model as an alternative cosmological theory to both the big bang and steady state theory cosmologies alfvén had a good sense of humor , and he participated in a variety of social issues and worldwide disarmament movements '' nuclear power is uniquely unforgiving : as swedish nobel physicist hannes alfvén said , '' no acts of god can be permitted '' alfvén was also interested in problems in cosmology and all aspects of auroral physics , and used schröder 's well known book on aurora , das phänomen des polarlichts the hannes alfvén prize , awarded annually by the european physical society for outstanding contributions in plasma physics , is named after him

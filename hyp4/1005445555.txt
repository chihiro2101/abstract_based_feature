in 1934 , alfvén taught physics at both the university of uppsala and the nobel institute for physics ( later renamed the manne siegbahn institute of physics ) in stockholm , sweden in 1940 , he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the royal institute of technology in stockholm his title was changed to chair of plasma physics in 1963 from 1954 to 1955 , alfvén was a fulbright scholar at the university of maryland , college park alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the university of california , san diego and the university of southern california in 1991 , alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the university of california , san diego and professor of plasma physics at the royal institute of technology in stockholm alfvén spent his later adult life alternating between california and sweden in 1937 , alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe , it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field hannes alfvén , 1937 '' cosmic radiation as an intra-galactic phenomenon '' , ark after winning the nobel prize for his works in magnetohydrodynamics , he emphasized that : in order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region , it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents his theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora ( based on earlier work by kristian birkeland ) was confirmed in 1967 , these currents now being known as birkeland currents alfvén 's work was disputed for many years by the senior scientist in space physics , the british mathematician and geophysics sydney chapman he remained an embittered outsider , winning little respect from other scientists even after he received the nobel prize alfvén recalled : when i describe plasma phenomena according to this formalism most referees do not understand what i say and turn down my papers hannes alfvén , '' double layers and circuits in astrophysics '' ( 1986 ) ieee transactions on plasma science ( issn 0093-3813 ) , vol '' nuclear power is uniquely unforgiving : as swedish nobel physicist hannes alfvén said , '' no acts of god can be permitted the hannes alfvén prize , awarded annually by the european physical society for outstanding contributions in plasma physics , is named after him qjras obituary 37 ( 1996 ) 259 hannes alfvén birth centennial 30 may 2008 ( 2008 )

meters per second ( m/s ) is the si unit for velocity and the unit recommended by the world meteorological organization for reporting wind speeds , and is amongst others used in weather forecasts in the nordic countries other nordic meteorological institutes have used this system for years with satisfactory results '' since 2010 the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) also recommends meters per second for reporting wind speed when approaching runways , replacing their former recommendation of using kilometers per hour ( km/h ) historically , wind speeds have also been classified using the beaufort scale , which is based on visual observations of specifically defined wind effects at sea or on land wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations , operating on varying scales ( from micro to macro scales ) the rossby waves are themselves a different wind speed from what we experience in the lower troposphere local weather conditions play a key role in influencing wind speed , as the formation of hurricanes , monsoons and cyclones as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind during the cyclone , several extreme gusts of greater than were recorded , with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27â€“2.75 times the mean wind speed unlike traditional cup and vane anemometers , ultrasonic wind sensors have no moving parts and are therefore used to measure wind speed in applications that require maintenance-free performance , such as on the top of wind turbines as the name suggests , ultrasonic wind sensors measure the wind speed using high-frequency sound kapartis , savvas ( 1999 ) '' anemometer employing standing wave normal to fluid flow and travelling wave normal to standing wave '' another tool used to measure wind velocity includes a gps combined with pitot tube in canada , reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the '' mean hourly '' wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50

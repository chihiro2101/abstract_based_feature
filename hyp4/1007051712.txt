meters per second ( m/s ) is the si unit for velocity and the unit recommended by the world meteorological organization for reporting wind speeds , and is amongst others used in weather forecasts in the nordic countries other nordic meteorological institutes have used this system for years with satisfactory results '' since 2010 the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) also recommends meters per second for reporting wind speed when approaching runways , replacing their former recommendation of using kilometers per hour ( km/h ) historically , wind speeds have also been classified using the beaufort scale , which is based on visual observations of specifically defined wind effects at sea or on land wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations , operating on varying scales ( from micro to macro scales ) there are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction , notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions it is vital to wind speed , because the greater the difference in pressure , the faster the wind flows ( from the high to low pressure ) to balance out the variation local weather conditions play a key role in influencing wind speed , as the formation of hurricanes , monsoons and cyclones as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind the fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of tropical cyclone olivia on 10 april 1996 : an automatic weather station on barrow island , australia , registered a maximum wind gust of the wind gust was evaluated by the wmo evaluation panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010 during the cyclone , several extreme gusts of greater than were recorded , with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27â€“2.75 times the mean wind speed in canada , reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the '' mean hourly '' wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 to convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another , the durst curve was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds , v t , and mean wind speed over one hour v 3600

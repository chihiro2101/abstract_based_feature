meters per second ( m/s ) is the si unit for velocity and the unit recommended by the world meteorological organization for reporting wind speeds , and is amongst others used in weather forecasts in the nordic countries historically , wind speeds have also been classified using the beaufort scale , which is based on visual observations of specifically defined wind effects at sea or on land wind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations , operating on varying scales ( from micro to macro scales ) there are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction , notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions it is vital to wind speed , because the greater the difference in pressure , the faster the wind flows ( from the high to low pressure ) to balance out the variation during the cyclone , several extreme gusts of greater than were recorded , with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27â€“2.75 times the mean wind speed the fastest wind speed observed on an exoplanet was hd 189733b , by scientists at the university of warwick in 2015 , measured at 5,400 mph , or 2.414 kilometres per second an anemometer is one of the tools used to measure wind speed by measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer , and then by mathematically processing the data , the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction wind speed is a common factor in the design of structures and buildings around the world to convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another , the durst curve was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds , v t , and mean wind speed over one hour v 3600

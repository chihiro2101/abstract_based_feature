meters per second ( m/s ) is the si unit for velocity and the unit recommended by the world meteorological organization for reporting wind speeds , and is amongst others used in weather forecasts in the nordic countries windspeed icelandic meteorological office '' the icelandic meteorological office now uses the si ( systeme internationale d'unites ) measurement metres per second ( m/s ) historically , wind speeds have also been classified using the beaufort scale , which is based on visual observations of specifically defined wind effects at sea or on land there are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction , notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions it is vital to wind speed , because the greater the difference in pressure , the faster the wind flows ( from the high to low pressure ) to balance out the variation during the cyclone , several extreme gusts of greater than were recorded , with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27â€“2.75 times the mean wind speed currently , the second-highest surface wind speed ever officially recorded is at the mount washington ( new hampshire ) observatory above sea level in the us on 12 april 1934 , using a heated anemometer an anemometer is one of the tools used to measure wind speed as the name suggests , ultrasonic wind sensors measure the wind speed using high-frequency sound in canada , reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the '' mean hourly '' wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 to convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another , the durst curve was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds , v t , and mean wind speed over one hour v 3600

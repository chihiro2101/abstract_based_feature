every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid many elements are essential to humans ' survival , such as calcium being what forms bones progressing towards increase of atomic number , the aufbau principle causes elements of the period to put electrons onto 4s , 3d , and 4p subshells , in that order the first twelve elements—k , ca , d-block elements—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively , which are placed on 4s and 3d after this element , the filled 3d subshell effectively withdraws from chemistry and the subsequent trend looks much like trends in the periods 2 and 3 p-block elements of period & nbsp ; 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth shell and obey the octet rule the period 's s-block metals put their differentiating electron onto 4s having vacancies among nominally lower states & nbsp ; – a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements contrary , six elements from gallium to krypton are the heaviest where all electron shells below the valence shell are filled completely potassium ( k ) is an alkali metal , placed under sodium and over rubidium , and is the first element of period 4 it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds it is soft enough to be cut with a knife and it is the second least dense element it has one of the most widely known and acknowledged biological roles in all animals and some plants , making up bones and teeth , and used in some applications in cells , such as signals for cellular processeses scandium ( sc ) is the third element in the period , and is the first transition metal in the periodic table titanium ( ti ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 4 titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron chromium is , like titanium and vanadium before it , extremely resistant to corrosion , and is indeed one of the main components of stainless steel cobalt ( co ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 9 being a noble gas , krypton rarely interacts with itself or other elements ; although compounds have been detected , they are all unstable and decay rapidly , and as such , krypton is often used in fluorescent lights period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors

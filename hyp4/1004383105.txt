every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid many elements are essential to humans ' survival , such as calcium being what forms bones progressing towards increase of atomic number , the aufbau principle causes elements of the period to put electrons onto 4s , 3d , and 4p subshells , in that order the first twelve elements—k , ca , d-block elements—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively , which are placed on 4s and 3d p-block elements of period & nbsp ; 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth shell and obey the octet rule it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds scandium ( sc ) is the third element in the period , and is the first transition metal in the periodic table titanium ( ti ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 4 titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron vanadium ( v ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 5 vanadium is similar to titanium in many ways , such as being very corrosion-resistant , however , unlike titanium , it oxidizes in air even at room temperature chromium ( cr ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 6 manganese , like chromium before it , is an important component in stainless steel , preventing the iron from rusting iron ( fe ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 8 iron also has some applications in the human body ; hemoglobin is partly iron cobalt ( co ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 9 however , nickel is very abundant in the earth 's core ; along with iron it is one of the two main components many period 4 elements find roles in controlling protein function as secondary messengers , structural components , or enzyme cofactors period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors

every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid many elements are essential to humans ' survival , such as calcium being what forms bones the first twelve elements—k , ca , d-block elements—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively , which are placed on 4s and 3d after this element , the filled 3d subshell effectively withdraws from chemistry and the subsequent trend looks much like trends in the periods 2 and 3 p-block elements of period & nbsp ; 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth shell and obey the octet rule the period 's s-block metals put their differentiating electron onto 4s having vacancies among nominally lower states & nbsp ; – a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements contrary , six elements from gallium to krypton are the heaviest where all electron shells below the valence shell are filled completely it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds scandium ( sc ) is the third element in the period , and is the first transition metal in the periodic table titanium ( ti ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 4 titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron vanadium is never found in pure form in nature , but is commonly found in compounds chromium ( cr ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 6 manganese ( mn ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 7 manganese , like chromium before it , is an important component in stainless steel , preventing the iron from rusting iron is the most common on earth among elements of the period , and probably the most well-known of them however , nickel is very abundant in the earth 's core ; along with iron it is one of the two main components many period 4 elements find roles in controlling protein function as secondary messengers , structural components , or enzyme cofactors period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors

every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid many elements are essential to humans ' survival , such as calcium being what forms bones progressing towards increase of atomic number , the aufbau principle causes elements of the period to put electrons onto 4s , 3d , and 4p subshells , in that order the first twelve elements—k , ca , d-block elements—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively , which are placed on 4s and 3d p-block elements of period & nbsp ; 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth shell and obey the octet rule the period 's s-block metals put their differentiating electron onto 4s having vacancies among nominally lower states & nbsp ; – a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements potassium ( k ) is an alkali metal , placed under sodium and over rubidium , and is the first element of period 4 it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds scandium ( sc ) is the third element in the period , and is the first transition metal in the periodic table titanium ( ti ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 4 titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron vanadium is never found in pure form in nature , but is commonly found in compounds vanadium is similar to titanium in many ways , such as being very corrosion-resistant , however , unlike titanium , it oxidizes in air even at room temperature chromium also has many colorful compounds , and as such is very commonly used in pigments , such as chrome green iron is the most common on earth among elements of the period , and probably the most well-known of them however , nickel is very abundant in the earth 's core ; along with iron it is one of the two main components selenium is the first nonmetal in period & nbsp ; 4 , with properties similar to sulfur bromine is also quite toxic and corrosive , but bromide ions , which are relatively inert , can be found in halite , or table salt period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors

every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid many elements are essential to humans ' survival , such as calcium being what forms bones the first twelve elements—k , ca , d-block elements—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively , which are placed on 4s and 3d contrary , six elements from gallium to krypton are the heaviest where all electron shells below the valence shell are filled completely potassium ( k ) is an alkali metal , placed under sodium and over rubidium , and is the first element of period 4 an alkali earth metal , calcium is almost never found in nature due to its high reactivity with water titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant , and as such has many applications , especially in alloys with other elements , such as iron vanadium is similar to titanium in many ways , such as being very corrosion-resistant , however , unlike titanium , it oxidizes in air even at room temperature all vanadium compounds have at least some level of toxicity , with some of them being extremely toxic chromium also has many colorful compounds , and as such is very commonly used in pigments , such as chrome green manganese ( mn ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 7 manganese , like chromium before it , is an important component in stainless steel , preventing the iron from rusting iron ( fe ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 8 iron is the most common on earth among elements of the period , and probably the most well-known of them nickel is an important component of stainless steel , and in many superalloys copper is also commonly used as a wood preservative or fungicides zinc is one of the main components of brass , being used since the 10th century bce zinc is also incredibly important to humans ; almost 2 billion people in the world suffer from zinc deficiency period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors

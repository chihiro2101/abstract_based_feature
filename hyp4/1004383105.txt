every single one of these elements is stable , and many are extremely common in the earth 's crust and/or core ; it is the last period with no unstable elements at all many of the transition metals in period 4 are very strong , and therefore commonly used in industry , especially iron three adjacent elements are known to be toxic , with arsenic one of the most well-known poisons , selenium being toxic to humans in large quantities , and bromine , a toxic liquid many elements are essential to humans ' survival , such as calcium being what forms bones progressing towards increase of atomic number , the aufbau principle causes elements of the period to put electrons onto 4s , 3d , and 4p subshells , in that order the first twelve elements—k , ca , d-block elements—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively , which are placed on 4s and 3d after this element , the filled 3d subshell effectively withdraws from chemistry and the subsequent trend looks much like trends in the periods 2 and 3 p-block elements of period & nbsp ; 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth shell and obey the octet rule contrary , six elements from gallium to krypton are the heaviest where all electron shells below the valence shell are filled completely it is one of the most reactive elements in the periodic table , therefore usually only found in compounds calcium ( ca ) is the second element in the period scandium ( sc ) is the third element in the period , and is the first transition metal in the periodic table vanadium is never found in pure form in nature , but is commonly found in compounds vanadium is similar to titanium in many ways , such as being very corrosion-resistant , however , unlike titanium , it oxidizes in air even at room temperature chromium is , like titanium and vanadium before it , extremely resistant to corrosion , and is indeed one of the main components of stainless steel manganese , like chromium before it , is an important component in stainless steel , preventing the iron from rusting manganese is also often used in pigments , again like chromium iron is the most common on earth among elements of the period , and probably the most well-known of them cobalt ( co ) is an element in group & nbsp ; 9 selenium is the first nonmetal in period & nbsp ; 4 , with properties similar to sulfur period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecule to form cofactors

while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks 430 & nbsp ; bc ) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems this method reached its high point with euclid 's elements ( 300 & nbsp ; bc ) , a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor : euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms ( though they do not always conform strictly to aristotelian templates ) aristotle 's syllogistic logic , together with the axiomatic method exemplified by euclid 's elements , are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient greece starting from the end of the 19th century , a platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians the concepts or , as platonists would have it , the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience : geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects , and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects indeed , many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans in the meno plato 's teacher socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval platonism - the philosophy of working mathematicians in this view , the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status , and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable for over 2,000 years , euclid 's elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics , as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians , philosophers , and scientists well into the 19th century isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) in england and leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) in germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient , but direly lacking rigorous justifications leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers ( close to zero ) may we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities ? '' then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications , but with little attention to logical foundations it gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers , arguably resolving the zeno paradoxes and berkeley 's arguments in 1858 , dedekind proposed a definition of the real numbers as cuts of rational numbers niels henrik abel ( 1802–1829 ) , a norwegian , and évariste galois , ( 1811–1832 ) a frenchman , investigated the solutions of various polynomial equations , and proved that there is no general algebraic solution to equations of degree greater than four ( abel–ruffini theorem ) mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient greeks then the russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky ( 1792–1856 ) established in 1826 ( and published in 1829 ) the coherence of this geometry ( thus the independence of the parallel postulate ) , in parallel with the hungarian mathematician jános bolyai ( 1802–1860 ) in 1832 , and with gauss it was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere systematic mathematical treatments of logic came with the british mathematician george boole ( 1847 ) who devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called boolean algebra , in which the only numbers were 0 and 1 and logical combinations ( conjunction , disjunction , implication and negation ) are operations similar to the addition and multiplication of integers logic thus became a branch of mathematics charles sanders peirce built upon the work of boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers , which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885 he exposed deficiencies in aristotle 's logic , and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory consistency : impossibility of proving contradictory statements he then showed in grundgesetze der arithmetik ( basic laws of arithmetic ) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic popular notations were ( x ) for universal and ( ∃x ) for existential quantifiers , coming from giuseppe peano and william ernest johnson until the ∀ symbol was introduced by gerhard gentzen in 1935 and became canonical in the 1960s this work summarized and extended the work of boole , de morgan , and peirce , and was a comprehensive reference to symbolic logic as it was understood at the end of the 19th century this was still a second-order axiomatization ( expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets , thus with an implicit use of set theory ) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood the foundational crisis of mathematics ( in german grundlagenkrise der mathematik ) was the early 20th century 's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) the leading school was that of the formalist approach , of which david hilbert was the foremost proponent , culminating in what is known as hilbert 's program , which thought to ground mathematics on a small basis of a logical system proved sound by metamathematics finitism means in 1920 hilbert succeeded in having brouwer , whom he considered a threat to mathematics , removed from the editorial board of mathematische annalen , the leading mathematical journal of the time some modern theory in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense more precisely , it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality ( an actual infinity ) suffices to imply the existence of a model ( a world of objects ) of any consistent theory starting in 1935 , the bourbaki group of french mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory thus the only thing we do n't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer , such as zf

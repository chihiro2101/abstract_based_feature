while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks early greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic , arithmetic or geometry 430 & nbsp ; bc ) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems aristotle 's syllogistic logic , together with the axiomatic method exemplified by euclid 's elements , are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient greece platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics starting from the end of the 19th century , a platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges : how do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation ? are they located in their representation , or in our minds , or somewhere else ? how can we know them ? the ancient greek philosophers took such questions very seriously plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans he believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind , but is discovered by humans in the meno plato 's teacher socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval this philosophy of platonism ( mathematics ) is shared by many mathematicians platonism - the philosophy of working mathematicians in this view , the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status , and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable not our axioms , but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation for over 2,000 years , euclid 's elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics , as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians , philosophers , and scientists well into the 19th century leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers ( close to zero ) may we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities ? '' then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications , but with little attention to logical foundations in the 19th century , mathematics became increasingly abstract previous conceptions of a function as a rule for computation , or a smooth graph , were no longer adequate mathematicians had attempted to solve all of these problems in vain since the time of the ancient greeks abel and galois 's works opened the way for the developments of group theory ( which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields ) , and abstract algebra at that time , the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it one of the traps in a deductive system is circular reasoning , a problem that seemed to befall projective geometry until it was resolved by karl von staudt however , cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry , features not admitted by purists for instance , in 1961 coxeter wrote introduction to geometry without mention of cross-ratio logic thus became a branch of mathematics the german mathematician gottlob frege ( 1848–1925 ) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his begriffsschrift ( formula language ) published in 1879 , a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic he then showed in grundgesetze der arithmetik ( basic laws of arithmetic ) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic the formalization of arithmetic ( the theory of natural numbers ) as an axiomatic theory started with peirce in 1881 and continued with richard dedekind and giuseppe peano in 1888 the foundational crisis of mathematics ( in german grundlagenkrise der mathematik ) was the early 20th century 's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics it has been claimed that formalists , such as david hilbert ( 1862 & ndash ; 1943 ) , hold that mathematics is only a language and a series of games virtually all mathematical theorems today can be formulated as theorems of set theory many researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic platonism , exemplified by kurt gödel precisely , for any consistent first-order theory it gives an '' explicit construction '' of a model described by the theory ; this model will be countable if the language of the theory is countable hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions : the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory starting in 1935 , the bourbaki group of french mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory one goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of '' core mathematics '' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis .

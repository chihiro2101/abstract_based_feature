while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted the discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by eudoxus of cnidus ( 408–355 & nbsp ; bc ) , a student of plato , who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples ( rational ratios ) , thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by richard dedekind ( 1831 & ndash ; 1916 ) in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems aristotle 's syllogistic logic , together with the axiomatic method exemplified by euclid 's elements , are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient greece starting from the end of the 19th century , a platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians the concepts or , as platonists would have it , the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience : geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects , and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges : how do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation ? are they located in their representation , or in our minds , or somewhere else ? how can we know them ? the ancient greek philosophers took such questions very seriously in the meno plato 's teacher socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval platonism - the philosophy of working mathematicians in this view , the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status , and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) in england and leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) in germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient , but direly lacking rigorous justifications leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers ( close to zero ) cauchy ( 1789–1857 ) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal calculus in a rigorous manner , rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors in his 1821 work cours d'analyse he defines infinitesimal in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0 , which he then used to define continuity it gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers , arguably resolving the zeno paradoxes and berkeley 's arguments weierstrass began to advocate the arithmetization of analysis , to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers this reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers , and thus of natural numbers , was later integrated by cantor in his set theory , and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by hilbert and bernays with these concepts , pierre wantzel ( 1837 ) proved that straightedge and compass alone can not trisect an arbitrary angle nor double a cube abel and galois 's works opened the way for the developments of group theory ( which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields ) , and abstract algebra concepts of vector spaces emerged from the conception of barycentric coordinates by möbius in 1827 , to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by peano in 1888 geometry was no more limited to three dimensions then the russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky ( 1792–1856 ) established in 1826 ( and published in 1829 ) the coherence of this geometry ( thus the independence of the parallel postulate ) , in parallel with the hungarian mathematician jános bolyai ( 1802–1860 ) in 1832 , and with gauss later in the 19th century , the german mathematician bernhard riemann developed elliptic geometry , another non-euclidean geometry where no parallel can be found and the sum of angles in a triangle is more than 180° rozenfel 'd ( 1996 ) mathematics of the 19th century : geometry , page 40 , birkhäuser the purely geometric approach of von staudt was based on the complete quadrilateral to express the relation of projective harmonic conjugates then he created a means of expressing the familiar numeric properties with his algebra of throws stillwell writes on page 120 the algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon numbers without worry about their basis however , cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry , features not admitted by purists attempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with leibniz and lambert ( 1728–1777 ) , and continued with works by algebraists such as george peacock ( 1791–1858 ) the german mathematician gottlob frege ( 1848–1925 ) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his begriffsschrift ( formula language ) published in 1879 , a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic he exposed deficiencies in aristotle 's logic , and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory consistency : impossibility of proving contradictory statements this was still a second-order axiomatization ( expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets , thus with an implicit use of set theory ) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood in dedekind 's work , this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction gödel 's incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency what hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system s was consistent , based on principles p that only made up a small part of s many researchers in axiomatic set theory have subscribed to what is known as set-theoretic platonism , exemplified by kurt gödel hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions : the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory thus the only thing we do n't have is a formal proof of consistency of whatever version of set theory we may prefer , such as zf one goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of '' core mathematics '' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis .

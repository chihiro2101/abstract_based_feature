while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks early greek philosophers disputed as to which is more basic , arithmetic or geometry 430 & nbsp ; bc ) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems this method reached its high point with euclid 's elements ( 300 & nbsp ; bc ) , a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor : euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms ( though they do not always conform strictly to aristotelian templates ) starting from the end of the 19th century , a platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians the concepts or , as platonists would have it , the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience : geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects , and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects their existence and nature present special philosophical challenges : how do mathematical objects differ from their concrete representation ? are they located in their representation , or in our minds , or somewhere else ? how can we know them ? the ancient greek philosophers took such questions very seriously plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans above the gateway to plato 's academy appeared a famous inscription : '' let no one who is ignorant of geometry enter here '' this philosophy of platonism ( mathematics ) is shared by many mathematicians it can be argued that platonism somehow comes as a necessary assumption underlying any mathematical work karlis podnieks , platonism , intuition and the nature of mathematics : 1 platonism - the philosophy of working mathematicians in this view , the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status , and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable not our axioms , but the very real world of mathematical objects forms the foundation for over 2,000 years , euclid 's elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics , as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians , philosophers , and scientists well into the 19th century isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) in england and leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) in germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient , but direly lacking rigorous justifications leibniz even went on to explicitly describe infinitesimals as actual infinitely small numbers ( close to zero ) may we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities ? '' then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications , but with little attention to logical foundations it gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers , arguably resolving the zeno paradoxes and berkeley 's arguments in 1882 , lindemann building on the work of hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle ( construction of a square equal in area to a given circle ) was also impossible by proving that is a transcendental number these concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized , breaking away from familiar mathematical objects then the russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky ( 1792–1856 ) established in 1826 ( and published in 1829 ) the coherence of this geometry ( thus the independence of the parallel postulate ) , in parallel with the hungarian mathematician jános bolyai ( 1802–1860 ) in 1832 , and with gauss it was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere rozenfel 'd ( 1996 ) mathematics of the 19th century : geometry , page 40 , birkhäuser the purely geometric approach of von staudt was based on the complete quadrilateral to express the relation of projective harmonic conjugates boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science he exposed deficiencies in aristotle 's logic , and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory consistency : impossibility of proving contradictory statements he then showed in grundgesetze der arithmetik ( basic laws of arithmetic ) how arithmetic could be formalised in his new logic frege 's work was popularized by bertrand russell near the turn of the century the formalization of arithmetic ( the theory of natural numbers ) as an axiomatic theory started with peirce in 1881 and continued with richard dedekind and giuseppe peano in 1888 the foundational crisis of mathematics ( in german grundlagenkrise der mathematik ) was the early 20th century 's term for the search for proper foundations of mathematics several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) more precisely , it shows that the mere assumption of the existence of the set of natural numbers as a totality ( an actual infinity ) suffices to imply the existence of a model ( a world of objects ) of any consistent theory for example , with theories that include arithmetic , such constructions generally give models that include non-standard numbers , unless the construction method was specifically designed to avoid them it thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in hilbert 's program 1964 : inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics , gregory chaitin starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory ( measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics ) one goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of '' core mathematics '' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis .

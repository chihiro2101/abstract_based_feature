while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted the discrepancy between rationals and reals was finally resolved by eudoxus of cnidus ( 408–355 & nbsp ; bc ) , a student of plato , who reduced the comparison of irrational ratios to comparisons of multiples ( rational ratios ) , thus anticipating the definition of real numbers by richard dedekind ( 1831 & ndash ; 1916 ) in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems this method reached its high point with euclid 's elements ( 300 & nbsp ; bc ) , a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor : euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms ( though they do not always conform strictly to aristotelian templates ) aristotle 's syllogistic logic , together with the axiomatic method exemplified by euclid 's elements , are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient greece the concepts or , as platonists would have it , the objects of mathematics are abstract and remote from everyday perceptual experience : geometrical figures are conceived as idealities to be distinguished from effective drawings and shapes of objects , and numbers are not confused with the counting of concrete objects indeed , many of their general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic plato ( 424/423 & nbsp ; bc 348/347 & nbsp ; bc ) insisted that mathematical objects , like other platonic ideas ( forms or essences ) , must be perfectly abstract and have a separate , non-material kind of existence , in a world of mathematical objects independent of humans karlis podnieks , platonism , intuition and the nature of mathematics : 1 platonism - the philosophy of working mathematicians in this view , the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status , and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable for over 2,000 years , euclid 's elements stood as a perfectly solid foundation for mathematics , as its methodology of rational exploration guided mathematicians , philosophers , and scientists well into the 19th century rené descartes published la géométrie ( 1637 ) , aimed at reducing geometry to algebra by means of coordinate systems , giving algebra a more foundational role ( while the greeks embedded arithmetic into geometry by identifying whole numbers with evenly spaced points on a line ) isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) in england and leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) in germany independently developed the infinitesimal calculus based on heuristic methods greatly efficient , but direly lacking rigorous justifications may we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities ? '' then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications , but with little attention to logical foundations concerns about logical gaps and inconsistencies in different fields led to the development of axiomatic systems cauchy ( 1789–1857 ) started the project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal calculus in a rigorous manner , rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors in his 1821 work cours d'analyse he defines infinitesimal in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0 , which he then used to define continuity the modern ( ε , δ ) -definition of limit and continuous functions was first developed by bolzano in 1817 , but remained relatively unknown it gives a rigorous foundation of infinitesimal calculus based on the set of real numbers , arguably resolving the zeno paradoxes and berkeley 's arguments weierstrass began to advocate the arithmetization of analysis , to axiomatize analysis using properties of the natural numbers in 1882 , lindemann building on the work of hermite showed that a straightedge and compass quadrature of the circle ( construction of a square equal in area to a given circle ) was also impossible by proving that is a transcendental number concepts of vector spaces emerged from the conception of barycentric coordinates by möbius in 1827 , to the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps by peano in 1888 these concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized , breaking away from familiar mathematical objects then the russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky ( 1792–1856 ) established in 1826 ( and published in 1829 ) the coherence of this geometry ( thus the independence of the parallel postulate ) , in parallel with the hungarian mathematician jános bolyai ( 1802–1860 ) in 1832 , and with gauss it was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere stillwell writes on page 120 the algebra of throws is commonly seen as a feature of cross-ratios since students ordinarily rely upon numbers without worry about their basis attempts of formal treatment of mathematics had started with leibniz and lambert ( 1728–1777 ) , and continued with works by algebraists such as george peacock ( 1791–1858 ) this was still a second-order axiomatization ( expressing induction in terms of arbitrary subsets , thus with an implicit use of set theory ) as concerns for expressing theories in first-order logic were not yet understood in dedekind 's work , this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) a contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory ( such as , showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected brouwer 's criticisms : thus hilbert is insisting that mathematics is not an arbitrary game with arbitrary rules ; rather it must agree with how our thinking , and then our speaking and writing , proceeds some modern theory in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense logicism is a school of thought , and research programme , in the philosophy of mathematics , based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical ' in nature gödel 's completeness theorem establishes an equivalence in first-order logic between the formal provability of a formula and its truth in all possible models it thus became clear that the notion of mathematical truth can not be completely determined and reduced to a purely formal system as envisaged in hilbert 's program starting in 1935 , the bourbaki group of french mathematicians started publishing a series of books to formalize many areas of mathematics on the new foundation of set theory

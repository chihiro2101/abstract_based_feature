while the practice of mathematics had previously developed in other civilizations , special interest in its theoretical and foundational aspects was clearly evident in the work of the ancient greeks 430 & nbsp ; bc ) produced four paradoxes that seem to show the impossibility of change the discovery of the irrationality of , the ratio of the diagonal of a square to its side ( around 5th century & nbsp ; bc ) , was a shock to them which they only reluctantly accepted in the posterior analytics , aristotle ( 384–322 & nbsp ; bc ) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts , axioms , postulates , definitions , and theorems aristotle 's syllogistic logic , together with the axiomatic method exemplified by euclid 's elements , are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient greece platonism as a traditional philosophy of mathematics starting from the end of the 19th century , a platonist view of mathematics became common among practicing mathematicians he believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind , but is discovered by humans in the meno plato 's teacher socrates asserts that it is possible to come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval this philosophy of platonism ( mathematics ) is shared by many mathematicians platonism - the philosophy of working mathematicians in this view , the laws of nature and the laws of mathematics have a similar status , and the effectiveness ceases to be unreasonable descartes ' book became famous after 1649 and paved the way to infinitesimal calculus may we not call them the ghosts of departed quantities ? '' then mathematics developed very rapidly and successfully in physical applications , but with little attention to logical foundations in the 19th century , mathematics became increasingly abstract in his 1821 work cours d'analyse he defines infinitesimal in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0 , which he then used to define continuity the modern ( ε , δ ) -definition of limit and continuous functions was first developed by bolzano in 1817 , but remained relatively unknown this reduction of real numbers and continuous functions in terms of rational numbers , and thus of natural numbers , was later integrated by cantor in his set theory , and axiomatized in terms of second order arithmetic by hilbert and bernays abel and galois 's works opened the way for the developments of group theory ( which would later be used to study symmetry in physics and other fields ) , and abstract algebra these concepts did not generalize numbers but combined notions of functions and sets which were not yet formalized , breaking away from familiar mathematical objects then the russian mathematician nikolai lobachevsky ( 1792–1856 ) established in 1826 ( and published in 1829 ) the coherence of this geometry ( thus the independence of the parallel postulate ) , in parallel with the hungarian mathematician jános bolyai ( 1802–1860 ) in 1832 , and with gauss it was proved consistent by defining point to mean a pair of antipodal points on a fixed sphere and line to mean a great circle on the sphere at that time , the main method for proving the consistency of a set of axioms was to provide a model for it one of the traps in a deductive system is circular reasoning , a problem that seemed to befall projective geometry until it was resolved by karl von staudt rozenfel 'd ( 1996 ) mathematics of the 19th century : geometry , page 40 , birkhäuser the purely geometric approach of von staudt was based on the complete quadrilateral to express the relation of projective harmonic conjugates however , cross-ratio calculations use metric features of geometry , features not admitted by purists boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science charles sanders peirce built upon the work of boole to develop a logical system for relations and quantifiers , which he published in several papers from 1870 to 1885 the german mathematician gottlob frege ( 1848–1925 ) presented an independent development of logic with quantifiers in his begriffsschrift ( formula language ) published in 1879 , a work generally considered as marking a turning point in the history of logic he exposed deficiencies in aristotle 's logic , and pointed out the three expected properties of a mathematical theory consistency : impossibility of proving contradictory statements in dedekind 's work , this approach appears as completely characterizing natural numbers and providing recursive definitions of addition and multiplication from the successor function and mathematical induction several schools of the philosophy of mathematics ran into difficulties one after the other in the 20th century , as the assumption that mathematics had any foundation that could be consistently stated within mathematics itself was heavily challenged by the discovery of various paradoxes ( such as russell 's paradox ) a contradiction in a formal theory is a formal proof of an absurdity inside the theory ( such as , showing that this theory is inconsistent and must be rejected at the beginning of the 20th century , three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other : formalism , intuitionism and logicism the foundational philosophy of intuitionism or constructivism , as exemplified in the extreme by brouwer and stephen kleene , requires proofs to be '' constructive '' in nature the existence of an object must be demonstrated rather than inferred from a demonstration of the impossibility of its non-existence logicism is a school of thought , and research programme , in the philosophy of mathematics , based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical ' in nature hence the existence of models as given by the completeness theorem needs in fact two philosophical assumptions : the actual infinity of natural numbers and the consistency of the theory 1964 : inspired by the fundamental randomness in physics , gregory chaitin starts publishing results on algorithmic information theory ( measuring incompleteness and randomness in mathematics ) one goal of the reverse mathematics program is to identify whether there are areas of '' core mathematics '' in which foundational issues may again provoke a crisis .

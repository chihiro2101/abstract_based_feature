thirlwall was born at stepney , london , to thomas and susannah thirlwall he went to charterhouse school , where george grote and julius hare were among his schoolfellows thirlwall now joined hare in translating niebuhr 's history of rome ; the first volume appeared in 1828 on hare 's departure from cambridge in 1832 , thirlwall became assistant college tutor , which led him to join in the great controversy upon the admission of dissenters which arose in 1834 thomas turton , the regius professor of divinity ( afterwards dean of westminster and bishop of ely ) , had written a pamphlet objecting to the admission thirlwall replied by pointing out that no provision for theological instruction was made by the colleges except compulsory attendance at chapel compared with grote 's history it lacks enthusiasm for a definite political ideal and is written entirely from the standpoint of a scholar in 1837 , thirlwall was proposed as bishop of norwich but his appointment was opposed y both king william iv and the archbishop of canterbury due to his liberal views the promotion was entirely the act of prime minister lord melbourne , an amateur in theology , who had read thirlwall 's introduction to schleiermacher , and satisfied himself of the propriety of the appointment he was one of four prelates who refused to prevent bishop colenso from preaching in their dioceses , and the only one who withheld his signature from the addresses calling upon colenso to resign his see he would have made an admirable successor to howley in the primacy , but such was the complexion of ecclesiastical politics that the elevation of the most impartial prelate of his day would have been resented as a piece of party spirit

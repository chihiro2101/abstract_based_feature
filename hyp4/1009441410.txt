he had made a 5,000 payoff to the lead new york police department homicide detective louis eppolito to ensure that the investigation yielded no leads gravano attempted to lie low for nearly three weeks afterwards , during which time he called his crew together and made the decision to kill castellano if necessary gravano and milito were then summoned to a meeting with castellano at a manhattan restaurant gravano , however , was spared execution when he convinced castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit the high publicity generated by the incident triggered an irs investigation into gravano and fiala 's deal for the sale of the plaza suite and gravano was subsequently charged with tax evasion in the aftermath of the fiala murder , gravano continued to focus on his construction business , branching out into the lucrative concrete paving industry '' gravano eventually became embroiled in a dispute with business partner louie dibono , a member of another gambino crew a sit-down with castellano was held , at which an irate gravano accused dibono of withholding 200,000 in payments for subcontracts and threatened to kill dibono dellacroce , however , was rising star john gotti 's mentor , and when word got back to him that dellacroce had supported gravano , gotti was impressed eventually , one of the reasons for gotti 's killing castellano was to save his brother and ruggiero gravano 's second choice to become boss after castellano 's murder was frank decicco , but decicco felt john gotti 's ego was too big to take a subservient role decicco argued that gotti 's boldness , intelligence , and charisma made him well-suited to be '' a good boss '' and he convinced gravano to give gotti a chance decicco and gravano , however , also made a secret pact to kill gotti and take over the family as boss and underboss , respectively , if they were unhappy with gotti 's leadership after one year they also recruited longtime capo joseph armone into the conspiracy armone 's support was critical ; he was a respected old-timer in the family , and it was believed he could help win over castellano supporters to the new regime it has long been a hard and fast rule in the mafia that killing a boss is forbidden without the support of a majority of the commission indeed , gotti 's planned hit would have been the first off-the-record hit on a boss since frank costello was nearly killed in 1957 not suspecting the plot against him , castellano invited decicco to a meeting on december 16 , 1985 , with fellow capos thomas gambino , james failla , and danny marino at sparks steak house in manhattan the conspirators considered the restaurant a prime location for the hit because the area would be packed with bustling crowds of holiday shoppers , making it easier for the assassins to blend in and escape around 5:30 , gravano spotted castellano 's lincoln town car stopped at a nearby intersection and , via walkie talkie , alerted the team of hitman stationed outside the restaurant of castellano 's approach however , it was an open secret that gotti was acting boss in all but name , and nearly all of the family 's capos knew he had been the one behind the hit gotti was formally acclaimed as the new boss of the gambino family at a meeting of 20 capos held on january 15 , 1986 gotti , in turn , selected decicco as his underboss and elevated gravano to capo after toddo aurello announced his desire to step down gravano arranged to have mormando murdered on his way to a meeting at gravano 's bensonhurst restaurant , tali's gravano later claimed that he did n't want the republic to publish the story , but relented after the paper allegedly threatened to reveal that his family was living with him in phoenix in february 2000 , gravano and nearly 40 other ring members—including his ex-wife debra , daughter karen , and gerard—were arrested on federal and state drug charges on september 7 , 2002 , after numerous delays , gravano was sentenced in new york to 20 years in prison

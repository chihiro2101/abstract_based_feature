was brought to the u.s as a child , while his father had been on the crew of a freighter when he jumped ship in canada and entered the u.s gravano 's father ran a small dress factory and maintained a good standard of living for the family early on , one of gravano 's relatives remarked that he looked like his uncle sammy gravano was sent to a school for '' incorrigibles '' ; however , just before he reached the age of 16 , the school refused to keep him any longer gravano 's father tried to redirect and discipline his son , including forcing him to attend mass , but had little success while an enlisted man , gravano mainly worked as a mess hall cook he rose to the rank of corporal and was granted an honorable discharge after two years his daughter karen gravano appeared on the vh1 reality series , mob wives beginning in 2011 , and released a book in 2013 titled mob daughter : the mafia , sammy '' the bull '' gravano , and me ! later in his mob career , gravano was ordered to help arrange the murder of his brother-in-law , nicholas scibetta gravano was a childhood friend of colombo crime family associate , gerard pappa the mafia had a longstanding presence in bensonhurst via the profaci family , which evolved into the colombo family he first became associated with the cosa nostra in 1968 through anthony spero , whose uncle shorty was an associate of the colombo family under future boss , carmine persico gravano was initially involved in crimes such as larceny , hijacking , and armed robbery gravano became a particular favorite of family boss joe colombo , who used gravano to picket the fbi manhattan headquarters as part of his italian-american civil rights league initiative gravano 's rise was so precipitous that it was generally understood that he would be among the first to made man when the cosa nostra 's membership books were reopened ( they had been closed since 1957 ) i felt like i was a million miles away , like this was all a dream the colucci murder won respect and approval from persico for gravano while shorty spero believed gravano rather than ralph , he and the colombo hierarchy decided that to avoid conflict , it was best for gravano to leave the colombo family and join the gambino crime family now with the gambinos , gravano became an associate of capo salvatore '' toddo '' aurello a former associate , however , falsely claimed to the new york county district attorney that gravano and another associate were responsible for a double murder from 1969 after gravano was indicted , he desperately needed money to pay his legal bills he quit his construction job and went on a self-described '' robbing rampage '' for a year and a half gravano 's robbery spree impressed aurello , who proposed him for membership in the gambino family soon after the membership books were reopened in 1978 , boss paul castellano allegedly ordered the murder of gambino associate nicholas scibetta since scibetta was gravano 's brother-in-law , castellano asked frank decicco to first notify gravano of the impending hit castellano was flabbergasted when he learned the crutch-ridden gravano personally took part in the hit gravano began to change his boss ' cowboy image of him when he entered into the plumbing and drywall business with his brother-in-law , edward garafola flush with cash , gravano also invested in trotting horses to race at the meadowlands racetrack in east rutherford , new jersey gravano also became the operator of a popular discotheque , the plaza suite , in the gravesend section of brooklyn gravano reportedly made 4,000 a week from the plaza suite alone gravano also used the club as his construction racket headquarters gravano further ingratiated himself to castellano when he interceded in a civil war that had erupted within the philadelphia crime family gravano and milito were then summoned to a meeting with castellano at a manhattan restaurant d'angelo was later killed by a colombo family associate celebrating his having been proposed for membership in the aftermath of the fiala murder , gravano continued to focus on his construction business , branching out into the lucrative concrete paving industry gambino underboss neil dellacroce intervened on gravano 's behalf and castellano told the two men to end their business partnership , though gravano 's standing with the boss slipped as a result of the incident during this time , the fbi had intensified its efforts against the gambino family and in august 1983 , three members of gotti 's crew – angelo ruggiero , john carneglia , and gene gotti – were indicted for heroin trafficking castellano was against anyone in the family dealing narcotics eventually , one of the reasons for gotti 's killing castellano was to save his brother and ruggiero when castellano was indicted for both his connection to roy demeo 's stolen car ring and as part of the mafia commission trial , he learned his own house had been bugged on the basis of evidence from the ruggiero tapes and he became livid ruggiero informed gravano that he and gotti were planning to murder castellano and asked for gravano 's support gravano was initially noncommittal , wanting to confer first with frank decicco gravano 's second choice to become boss after castellano 's murder was frank decicco , but decicco felt john gotti 's ego was too big to take a subservient role decicco argued that gotti 's boldness , intelligence , and charisma made him well-suited to be '' a good boss '' and he convinced gravano to give gotti a chance the conspirators ' first order of business was meeting with other gambino members , most of whom were disaffected under castellano , and gaining their support for the hit armone 's support was critical ; he was a respected old-timer in the family , and it was believed he could help win over castellano supporters to the new regime indeed , gotti 's planned hit would have been the first off-the-record hit on a boss since frank costello was nearly killed in 1957 gotti and ruggiero then sought and obtained the approval of key figures from the colombos and bonannos , while decicco secured the backing of top mobsters aligned with the luccheses gotti , enraged that castellano chose not to attend his mentor 's wake , wasted little time in striking gotti and gravano arrived at the restaurant shortly before 5 o'clock and , after circling the block , parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance however , it was an open secret that gotti was acting boss in all but name , and nearly all of the family 's capos knew he had been the one behind the hit gotti was formally acclaimed as the new boss of the gambino family at a meeting of 20 capos held on january 15 , 1986 gotti , in turn , selected decicco as his underboss and elevated gravano to capo after toddo aurello announced his desire to step down the first person on gravano 's hit list after castellano 's murder was nicholas mormando , a former member of his crew however , in 1995 , gravano left witness protection and relocated to scottsdale , arizona the fbi alleged that peter gotti ordered two gambino soldiers , thomas '' huck '' carbonaro and eddie garafola , to murder gravano in arizona in 1999 gravano was implicated by informants in his own drug ring , as well as by recorded conversations in which he discussed drug profits

the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one many cultured fishes ( tilapia , carp , catfish , many others ) require no meat or fish products in their diets top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc vegetable-derived proteins have successfully replaced fish meal in feeds for carnivorous fishes , but vegetable-derived oils have not successfully been incorporated into the diets of carnivores the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway in choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could , potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments , which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms results demonstrated a significant difference in the immune and inflammatory responses and pathology in heart tissue as the fish were infected with pmcv however , fish tend also to be animals that aggregate into large schools at high density most successful aquaculture species are schooling species , which do not have social problems at high density sea lice and salmon : elevating the dialogue on the farmed-wild salmon story watershed watch salmon society , 2004 sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus , blood , and skin , and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming , planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages , which can persist for several days in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 there , juvenile wild salmon must '' run a gauntlet '' of large fish farms located off-shore near river outlets before making their way to sea use of antibiotics in food production is thought to increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in human diseases at some facilities , the use of antibiotic drugs in aquaculture has decreased considerably due to vaccinations and other techniques the lice and pathogen problems of the 1990s facilitated the development of current treatment methods for sea lice and pathogens , which reduced the stress from parasite/pathogen problems however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk the large number of fish kept long-term in a single location contributes to habitat destruction of the nearby areas the interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized the gmo fish crowded out the wild fish in spawning beds , but the offspring were less likely to survive the colorant used to make pen-raised salmon appear rosy like the wild fish has been linked with retinal problems in humans through this system , many of the environmental drawbacks of aquaculture are minimized including escaped fish , water usage , and the introduction of pollutants coâ‚‚ narcosis exsanguination without stunning is a process in which fish are taken up from water , held still , and cut so as to cause bleeding electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water ( dry stunning ) or while the fish is still in the water

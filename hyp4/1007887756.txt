the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one many cultured fishes ( tilapia , carp , catfish , many others ) require no meat or fish products in their diets top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc vegetable-derived proteins have successfully replaced fish meal in feeds for carnivorous fishes , but vegetable-derived oils have not successfully been incorporated into the diets of carnivores research is underway to try to change this , such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , examined three infectious diseases in norwegian salmon fish farms—heart and skeletal muscle inflammation , pancreas disease , and infectious salmon anemia fish fed with functional feeds with low lipid content demonstrated milder and delayed inflammatory response and therefore , less severe heart lesions at earlier and later stages after have pmcv infection sea lice and salmon : elevating the dialogue on the farmed-wild salmon story watershed watch salmon society , 2004 sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus , blood , and skin , and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming , planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages , which can persist for several days a 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations there , juvenile wild salmon must '' run a gauntlet '' of large fish farms located off-shore near river outlets before making their way to sea the farms allegedly cause such severe sea lice infestations that one study predicted in 2007 a 99 % collapse in the wild salmon population by 2011 however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk aquaculture not only impact the fish on the farm , but it also involves environmental interactions with other species , which in return are attracted or repelled by the farms not only does this help with the pollution problem , but water with a stronger current also aids in overall fish growth in regards to genetically modified , farmed salmon , concern has been raised over their proven reproductive advantage and how it could potentially decimate local fish populations , if released into the wild the concerns and critiques of cultivating this gmo fish in aquaculture are that the fish will escape and interact with other fish ultimately leading to the reproduction with other fishes another method of preventing aqua advantage fish from impacting the ecosystems in the case they escape suggested by the fda was to create sterile triploid females the gmo fish crowded out the wild fish in spawning beds , but the offspring were less likely to survive in 2008 , the us national organic standards board allowed farmed fish to be labeled as organic provided less than 25 % of their feed came from wild fish through this system , many of the environmental drawbacks of aquaculture are minimized including escaped fish , water usage , and the introduction of pollutants co₂ narcosis exsanguination without stunning is a process in which fish are taken up from water , held still , and cut so as to cause bleeding electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water ( dry stunning ) or while the fish is still in the water

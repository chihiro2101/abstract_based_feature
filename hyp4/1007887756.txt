the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one many cultured fishes ( tilapia , carp , catfish , many others ) require no meat or fish products in their diets top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc research is underway to try to change this , such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , examined three infectious diseases in norwegian salmon fish farms—heart and skeletal muscle inflammation , pancreas disease , and infectious salmon anemia functional feeds are defined as high-quality feeds that beyond purposes of nutrition , they are formulated with health promoting features that could be beneficial in supporting disease resistance , such as cms in choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could , potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments , which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms in this investigation three fishmeal-based diets were served—one made of 31 % lipid and the other two made of 18 % lipid ( one contained fishmeal and the other krill meal secondly , farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild ( e.g in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 a 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations there , juvenile wild salmon must '' run a gauntlet '' of large fish farms located off-shore near river outlets before making their way to sea this claim , however , has been criticized by numerous scientists who question the correlation between increased fish farming and increases in sea lice infestation among wild salmon because of parasite problems , some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive , but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to 30 % ciwf trust report , '' in too deep – the welfare of intensively farmed fish '' ( 2002 ) additionally , other common drugs used in salmonid fish farms in north america and europe include anesthetic , chemotherapeutic , and anthelmintic agents however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk the high concentrations of fish produce a significant amount of condensed faeces , often contaminated with drugs , which again affects local waterways the gmo fish crowded out the wild fish in spawning beds , but the offspring were less likely to survive in 2008 , the us national organic standards board allowed farmed fish to be labeled as organic provided less than 25 % of their feed came from wild fish shore , randy ( 17 november 2012 ) salmon farming comes ashore in land-based aquaculture the vancouver sun , retrieved 21 february 2013 '' following are some of the less humane ways of killing fish proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process ( e.g electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water ( dry stunning ) or while the fish is still in the water

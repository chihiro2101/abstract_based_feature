the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one many cultured fishes ( tilapia , carp , catfish , many others ) require no meat or fish products in their diets top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc research is underway to try to change this , such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , examined three infectious diseases in norwegian salmon fish farmsâ€”heart and skeletal muscle inflammation , pancreas disease , and infectious salmon anemia fish fed with functional feeds with low lipid content demonstrated milder and delayed inflammatory response and therefore , less severe heart lesions at earlier and later stages after have pmcv infection 50,000 fish in a area sea lice and salmon : elevating the dialogue on the farmed-wild salmon story watershed watch salmon society , 2004 adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice , but small , thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 such parasites have been shown to have an effect on nearby wild fish there , juvenile wild salmon must '' run a gauntlet '' of large fish farms located off-shore near river outlets before making their way to sea the farms allegedly cause such severe sea lice infestations that one study predicted in 2007 a 99 % collapse in the wild salmon population by 2011 because of parasite problems , some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive , but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to 30 % the high concentrations of fish produce a significant amount of condensed faeces , often contaminated with drugs , which again affects local waterways aquaculture not only impact the fish on the farm , but it also involves environmental interactions with other species , which in return are attracted or repelled by the farms the interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized once an area has been so contaminated , the fish farms are moved to new , uncontaminated areas another method of preventing aqua advantage fish from impacting the ecosystems in the case they escape suggested by the fda was to create sterile triploid females the colorant used to make pen-raised salmon appear rosy like the wild fish has been linked with retinal problems in humans from 2011 , a team from the university of waterloo led by tahbit chowdhury and gordon graff examined vertical ras aquaculture designs aimed at producing protein-rich fish species ice baths or chilling of farmed fish on ice or submerged in near-freezing water is used to dampen muscle movements by the fish and to delay the onset of post-death decay proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process ( e.g

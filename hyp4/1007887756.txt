the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one many cultured fishes ( tilapia , carp , catfish , many others ) require no meat or fish products in their diets top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc vegetable-derived proteins have successfully replaced fish meal in feeds for carnivorous fishes , but vegetable-derived oils have not successfully been incorporated into the diets of carnivores research is underway to try to change this , such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , examined three infectious diseases in norwegian salmon fish farms—heart and skeletal muscle inflammation , pancreas disease , and infectious salmon anemia in choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could , potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments , which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms fish fed with functional feeds with low lipid content demonstrated milder and delayed inflammatory response and therefore , less severe heart lesions at earlier and later stages after have pmcv infection secondly , farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild ( e.g however , fish tend also to be animals that aggregate into large schools at high density in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 a 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations this claim , however , has been criticized by numerous scientists who question the correlation between increased fish farming and increases in sea lice infestation among wild salmon ciwf trust report , '' in too deep – the welfare of intensively farmed fish '' ( 2002 ) additionally , other common drugs used in salmonid fish farms in north america and europe include anesthetic , chemotherapeutic , and anthelmintic agents however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk the large number of fish kept long-term in a single location contributes to habitat destruction of the nearby areas aquaculture not only impact the fish on the farm , but it also involves environmental interactions with other species , which in return are attracted or repelled by the farms not only does this help with the pollution problem , but water with a stronger current also aids in overall fish growth the concerns and critiques of cultivating this gmo fish in aquaculture are that the fish will escape and interact with other fish ultimately leading to the reproduction with other fishes in 2008 , the us national organic standards board allowed farmed fish to be labeled as organic provided less than 25 % of their feed came from wild fish ice baths or chilling of farmed fish on ice or submerged in near-freezing water is used to dampen muscle movements by the fish and to delay the onset of post-death decay electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water ( dry stunning ) or while the fish is still in the water however , improper stunning may not induce insensibility long enough to prevent the fish from enduring exsanguination while conscious

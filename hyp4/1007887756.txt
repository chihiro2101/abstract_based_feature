the issue of feeds in fish farming has been a controversial one many cultured fishes ( tilapia , carp , catfish , many others ) require no meat or fish products in their diets top-level carnivores ( most salmon species ) depend on fish feed of which a portion is usually derived from wild-caught fish ( anchovies , menhaden , etc vegetable-derived proteins have successfully replaced fish meal in feeds for carnivorous fishes , but vegetable-derived oils have not successfully been incorporated into the diets of carnivores research is underway to try to change this , such that even salmon and other carnivores could be successfully fed with vegetable products the f3 challenge ( fish-free feed challenge ) , as explained by a report from wired in february 2017 , '' is a race to sell 100,000 metric tons of fish food , without the fish '' not only do the feeds for carnivorous fish , like certain salmon species , remain controversial due to the containment of wild caught fish like anchovies , but they are not helping the health of the fish , as is the case in norway , examined three infectious diseases in norwegian salmon fish farmsâ€”heart and skeletal muscle inflammation , pancreas disease , and infectious salmon anemia in choosing a clinical nutrition approach using functional feeds could , potentially move away from chemotherapeutic and antibiotic treatments , which could lower the costs of disease treatment and management in fish farms fish fed with functional feeds with low lipid content demonstrated milder and delayed inflammatory response and therefore , less severe heart lesions at earlier and later stages after have pmcv infection secondly , farmed fish are kept in concentrations never seen in the wild ( e.g 50,000 fish in a area sea lice and salmon : elevating the dialogue on the farmed-wild salmon story watershed watch salmon society , 2004 in scotland , official figures show that more than nine million fish were lost to disease , parasites , botched treatment attempts and other problems on fish farms between 2016 and 2019 a 2008 meta-analysis of available data shows that salmon farming reduces the survival of associated wild salmon populations there , juvenile wild salmon must '' run a gauntlet '' of large fish farms located off-shore near river outlets before making their way to sea because of parasite problems , some aquaculture operators frequently use strong antibiotic drugs to keep the fish alive , but many fish still die prematurely at rates up to 30 % however , being in an ocean environment , the transfer of disease organisms from the wild fish to the aquaculture fish is an ever-present risk the interactions that wild organisms have with aquaculture may have implications on the management of fisheries species and the ecosystem in relation to how the fish farms are structured and organized not only does this help with the pollution problem , but water with a stronger current also aids in overall fish growth concern remains that resultant bacterial growth strips the water of oxygen , reducing or killing off the local marine life biologist rick howard did a controlled laboratory study where wild fish and gmo fish were allowed to breed the concerns and critiques of cultivating this gmo fish in aquaculture are that the fish will escape and interact with other fish ultimately leading to the reproduction with other fishes proper stunning renders the fish unconscious immediately and for a sufficient period of time such that the fish is killed in the slaughter process ( e.g electric stunning can be applied after the fish has been taken out of the water ( dry stunning ) or while the fish is still in the water

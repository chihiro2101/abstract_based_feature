boeing had worked on a number of small-scale supersonic transport ( sst ) studies since 1952 most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) kennedy tasked the federal aviation administration with preparing a report on '' national aviation goals for the period between now and 1970 '' the study was prompted in the wake of several accidents , which led to the belief that the industry was becoming moribund two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments halaby argued that a failure to enter this market would be a '' stunning setback '' kennedy had put lyndon johnson on the sst file , and he turned to robert mcnamara for guidance mcnamara was highly skeptical of the sst project and savaged halaby 's predictions ; he was also afraid the project might be turned over to the dod and was careful to press for further studies the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization these problems were well understood within the industry ; the iata released a set of '' design imperatives '' for an sst that were essentially impossible to meet—the release was a warning to promoters of the sst within the industry by mid-1962 , it was becoming clear that tentative talks earlier that year between the british aircraft corporation and sud aviation on a merger of their sst projects were more serious than originally thought the baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with mach 3 performance with 2,400 mile range in order to serve the domestic market they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans in spite of vocal opponents , questions about the technical requirements , and extremely negative reports about its economic viability , the sst project gathered strong backing from industry and the faa kennedy introduced the national supersonic transport program on june 5 , 1963 in a speech at the us air force academy requests for proposals were sent out to airframe manufacturers boeing , lockheed , and north american for the airframes ; and curtiss-wright , general electric and pratt & whitney for engines despite not having a selected design , orders from air carriers started flowing in immediately boeing 's entry was essentially identical to the swing-wing model 733 studied in 1960 ; it was known officially as the model , but also referred to both as the 1966 model and the model 2707 the latter name became the best known in public , while boeing continued to use 733 model numbers internally like the concorde , it featured a long and skinny fuselage , engines under the wing , and a compound delta planform the north american nac-60 was essentially a scaled-up b-70 with a less tapered fuselage and new compound-delta wing compared to the other designs , the rounded nose profile and more cylindrical cross-section gave the nac-60 a decidedly more conventional look than the other entries in november , another design review was held , and by this time boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model , the model 733-290 it was one of the earliest wide-body aircraft designs , with 2-3-2 row seating arrangement at its widest section '' commercial aircraft survey '' , flight , november 23 , 1967 , p in a fuselage that was considerably wider than aircraft then in service the sst mock-up included both overhead storage for smaller items with restraining nets , as well as large drop-in bins between sections of the aircraft in the main 247-seat tourist-class cabin , the entertainment system consisted of retractable televisions placed between every sixth row in the overhead storage a major change in the design came when boeing added canards behind the nose—which added weight the new design was also smaller , seating 234 , and known as the model 2707-300 labor unions also supported the sst project , worried that the winding down of both the vietnam war and apollo program would lead to mass unemployment in the aerospace sector afl-cio president george meany suggested that the race to develop a first-generation sst was already lost , but the us should '' enter the competition for the second generation —the ssts of the 1980s and 1990s though many designs have been studied since , it is unlikely sst aircraft will be economically feasible in the near future as the most advanced supersonic transports became some of the oldest airframes in the fleet , profits eventually fell , due to rising maintenance costs boeing 's latest sst proposal

boeing had worked on a number of small-scale supersonic transport ( sst ) studies since 1952 most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) '' lost classics - boeing 2707-200 sst '' shortly after taking office , president john f the study was prompted in the wake of several accidents , which led to the belief that the industry was becoming moribund two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments only one month later the faa 's new director , najeeb halaby , produced the commission on national aviation goals , better known as project horizon among other suggestions , the report was used as a platform to promote the sst kennedy had put lyndon johnson on the sst file , and he turned to robert mcnamara for guidance mcnamara was highly skeptical of the sst project and savaged halaby 's predictions ; he was also afraid the project might be turned over to the dod and was careful to press for further studies the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization by mid-1962 , it was becoming clear that tentative talks earlier that year between the british aircraft corporation and sud aviation on a merger of their sst projects were more serious than originally thought in november 1962 , still to the surprise of many , the concorde project was announced this set off something of a wave of panic in other countries , as it was widely believed that almost all future commercial aircraft would be supersonic , bill yenne , '' inside boeing : building the 777 '' the baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with mach 3 performance with 2,400 mile range in order to serve the domestic market they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans in spite of vocal opponents , questions about the technical requirements , and extremely negative reports about its economic viability , the sst project gathered strong backing from industry and the faa this might have been delayed , but in may , pan am announced they had placed options on the concorde juan trippe leaked the information earlier that month , stating that the airline would not ignore the sst market , and would buy from europe if need be the north american nac-60 was essentially a scaled-up b-70 with a less tapered fuselage and new compound-delta wing the use of high-lift devices on the leading edge of the wing lowered the landing angles to the point where the '' drooping nose '' was not required , and a more conventional rounded design was used this also meant it would fly slower , at mach 2.65 in november , another design review was held , and by this time boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model , the model 733-290 when the wings were in their swept-back position , they merged with the tailplane to produce a delta-wing planform when this occurred , boeing 's design was now the 300-seat model 733-390 after a lengthy review the boeing design was announced as the winner on january 1 , 1967 lockheed 's l-2000 was judged simpler to produce and less risky , but its performance was slightly lower and its noise levels slightly higher the 733-390 would have been an advanced aircraft even if it had been only subsonic the sst mock-up included both overhead storage for smaller items with restraining nets , as well as large drop-in bins between sections of the aircraft flexing of the fuselage ( it would have been the longest ever built ) threatened to make control difficult fahey , an atmospheric scientist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , and others found that the drop in ozone would be from 1 to 2 % if a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft was operated a & nbsp ; counterattack was organized under the banner of the '' national committee for an american sst '' , which urged supporters to send in 1 to keep the program alive '' despite this newfound support , the house of representatives also voted to end sst funding on 20 & nbsp ; may 1971 '' concorde retires '' , concordesst.com the final-configuration boeing 2707 mockup was sold to a museum and displayed at the sst aviation exhibit center in kissimmee , florida , from 1973 to 1981 seattle supersonics team index the boeing 2707 was one of the first commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit

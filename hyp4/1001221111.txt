boeing had worked on a number of small-scale supersonic transport ( sst ) studies since 1952 most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) in 1960 , an internal competition was run on a baseline 150-seat aircraft for trans-atlantic routes , and the swing-wing version won '' lost classics - boeing 2707-200 sst '' shortly after taking office , president john f two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments only one month later the faa 's new director , najeeb halaby , produced the commission on national aviation goals , better known as project horizon mcnamara was highly skeptical of the sst project and savaged halaby 's predictions ; he was also afraid the project might be turned over to the dod and was careful to press for further studies the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization if fuel costs were to change dramatically , ssts would not be competitive these problems were well understood within the industry ; the iata released a set of '' design imperatives '' for an sst that were essentially impossible to meetâ€”the release was a warning to promoters of the sst within the industry by mid-1962 , it was becoming clear that tentative talks earlier that year between the british aircraft corporation and sud aviation on a merger of their sst projects were more serious than originally thought in november 1962 , still to the surprise of many , the concorde project was announced this set off something of a wave of panic in other countries , as it was widely believed that almost all future commercial aircraft would be supersonic , bill yenne , '' inside boeing : building the 777 '' three days after the concorde announcement , halaby wrote a letter to kennedy suggesting that if they did not immediately start their own sst effort , the us would lose 50,000 jobs , 4 billion in income , and 3 billion in capital as local carriers turned to foreign suppliers a report from the supersonic transport advisory group ( stag ) followed , noting that the european team was in the lead in basic development , and suggested competing by developing a more advanced design with better economics the baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with mach 3 performance with 2,400 mile range in order to serve the domestic market they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans in spite of vocal opponents , questions about the technical requirements , and extremely negative reports about its economic viability , the sst project gathered strong backing from industry and the faa juan trippe leaked the information earlier that month , stating that the airline would not ignore the sst market , and would buy from europe if need be requests for proposals were sent out to airframe manufacturers boeing , lockheed , and north american for the airframes ; and curtiss-wright , general electric and pratt & whitney for engines boeing 's entry was essentially identical to the swing-wing model 733 studied in 1960 ; it was known officially as the model , but also referred to both as the 1966 model and the model 2707 the blended wing root spanned almost all of cabin area , and this early version had a much more stubby look than the models that would ultimately evolve the only major design difference was the use of individual pods for the engines , rather than pairs the cl-823 lacked any form of high-lift devices on the wings , relying on engine power and long runways for liftoff , ensuring a huge noise footprint the north american nac-60 was essentially a scaled-up b-70 with a less tapered fuselage and new compound-delta wing in november , another design review was held , and by this time boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model , the model 733-290 due to concerns about jet blast , the four engines were moved to a position underneath an enlarged tailplane both the boeing and lockheed l-2000 designs were presented in september 1966 along with full-scale mock-ups after a lengthy review the boeing design was announced as the winner on january 1 , 1967 boeing predicted that if the go-ahead were given , construction of the sst prototypes would begin in early 1967 and the first flight could be made in early 1970 though many designs have been studied since , it is unlikely sst aircraft will be economically feasible in the near future '' concorde retires '' , concordesst.com the final-configuration boeing 2707 mockup was sold to a museum and displayed at the sst aviation exhibit center in kissimmee , florida , from 1973 to 1981 seattle supersonics team index the boeing 2707 was one of the first commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit by the 1980s , glass cockpits became standard on all large commercial jets and by the 2000s , most light aircraft were equipped with them

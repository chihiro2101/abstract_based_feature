boeing had worked on a number of small-scale supersonic transport ( sst ) studies since 1952 most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) in 1960 , an internal competition was run on a baseline 150-seat aircraft for trans-atlantic routes , and the swing-wing version won '' lost classics - boeing 2707-200 sst '' shortly after taking office , president john f kennedy tasked the federal aviation administration with preparing a report on '' national aviation goals for the period between now and 1970 '' two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments only one month later the faa 's new director , najeeb halaby , produced the commission on national aviation goals , better known as project horizon the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization if fuel costs were to change dramatically , ssts would not be competitive these problems were well understood within the industry ; the iata released a set of '' design imperatives '' for an sst that were essentially impossible to meetâ€”the release was a warning to promoters of the sst within the industry this set off something of a wave of panic in other countries , as it was widely believed that almost all future commercial aircraft would be supersonic , bill yenne , '' inside boeing : building the 777 '' the baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with mach 3 performance with 2,400 mile range in order to serve the domestic market they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans in spite of vocal opponents , questions about the technical requirements , and extremely negative reports about its economic viability , the sst project gathered strong backing from industry and the faa '' the supersonic transport as an instrument of national power '' requests for proposals were sent out to airframe manufacturers boeing , lockheed , and north american for the airframes ; and curtiss-wright , general electric and pratt & whitney for engines the faa estimated that there would be a market for 500 ssts by 1990 '' aviation : sstart '' , time , 24 january 1964 preliminary designs were submitted to the faa on january 15 , 1964 the design resembled the future b-1 lancer bomber , with the exception that the four engines were mounted in individual nacelles instead of paired pods used on the lancer the only major design difference was the use of individual pods for the engines , rather than pairs the design retained the high-mounted canard above the cockpit area , and the box-like engine area under the fuselage the use of high-lift devices on the leading edge of the wing lowered the landing angles to the point where the '' drooping nose '' was not required , and a more conventional rounded design was used compared to the other designs , the rounded nose profile and more cylindrical cross-section gave the nac-60 a decidedly more conventional look than the other entries in november , another design review was held , and by this time boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model , the model 733-290 due to concerns about jet blast , the four engines were moved to a position underneath an enlarged tailplane both the boeing and lockheed l-2000 designs were presented in september 1966 along with full-scale mock-ups after a lengthy review the boeing design was announced as the winner on january 1 , 1967 boeing predicted that if the go-ahead were given , construction of the sst prototypes would begin in early 1967 and the first flight could be made in early 1970 flightglobal.com flightglobal.com the boeing team fell back on a tailed delta fixed wing fahey expressed the opinion that this would not be a fatal obstacle for an advanced sst development even faster subsonic designs , like the boeing sonic cruiser , have been met with little industry interest in an era of increasingly higher economic pressures on the airlines the supercritical wing was originally developed as part of the sst efforts in the u.s seattle supersonics team index the boeing 2707 was one of the first commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit boeing 's latest sst proposal

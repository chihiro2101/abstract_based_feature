boeing had worked on a number of small-scale supersonic transport ( sst ) studies since 1952 most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) in 1960 , an internal competition was run on a baseline 150-seat aircraft for trans-atlantic routes , and the swing-wing version won '' lost classics - boeing 2707-200 sst '' shortly after taking office , president john f kennedy tasked the federal aviation administration with preparing a report on '' national aviation goals for the period between now and 1970 '' two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments only one month later the faa 's new director , najeeb halaby , produced the commission on national aviation goals , better known as project horizon mcnamara was highly skeptical of the sst project and savaged halaby 's predictions ; he was also afraid the project might be turned over to the dod and was careful to press for further studies the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization these problems were well understood within the industry ; the iata released a set of '' design imperatives '' for an sst that were essentially impossible to meetâ€”the release was a warning to promoters of the sst within the industry by mid-1962 , it was becoming clear that tentative talks earlier that year between the british aircraft corporation and sud aviation on a merger of their sst projects were more serious than originally thought this set off something of a wave of panic in other countries , as it was widely believed that almost all future commercial aircraft would be supersonic , bill yenne , '' inside boeing : building the 777 '' as if this were not enough , it soon became known that the soviets were also working on a similar design they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans juan trippe leaked the information earlier that month , stating that the airline would not ignore the sst market , and would buy from europe if need be kennedy introduced the national supersonic transport program on june 5 , 1963 in a speech at the us air force academy '' aviation : sstart '' , time , 24 january 1964 preliminary designs were submitted to the faa on january 15 , 1964 boeing 's entry was essentially identical to the swing-wing model 733 studied in 1960 ; it was known officially as the model , but also referred to both as the 1966 model and the model 2707 the blended wing root spanned almost all of cabin area , and this early version had a much more stubby look than the models that would ultimately evolve the north american nac-60 was essentially a scaled-up b-70 with a less tapered fuselage and new compound-delta wing in november , another design review was held , and by this time boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model , the model 733-290 both the boeing and lockheed l-2000 designs were presented in september 1966 along with full-scale mock-ups after a lengthy review the boeing design was announced as the winner on january 1 , 1967 the design would be powered by the general electric ge4 engines lockheed 's l-2000 was judged simpler to produce and less risky , but its performance was slightly lower and its noise levels slightly higher it was one of the earliest wide-body aircraft designs , with 2-3-2 row seating arrangement at its widest section '' commercial aircraft survey '' , flight , november 23 , 1967 , p the sst mock-up included both overhead storage for smaller items with restraining nets , as well as large drop-in bins between sections of the aircraft , '' aerospace world '' , air force and space digest , air force association , washington , d.c flightglobal.com flightglobal.com the boeing team fell back on a tailed delta fixed wing the new design was also smaller , seating 234 , and known as the model 2707-300 the inherently lower lift-to-drag ratios at supersonic speeds mean ssts will have poorer fuel economy than subsonic designs '' concorde retires '' , concordesst.com the final-configuration boeing 2707 mockup was sold to a museum and displayed at the sst aviation exhibit center in kissimmee , florida , from 1973 to 1981 seattle supersonics team index the boeing 2707 was one of the first commercial aircraft designed with a glass cockpit an advertisement for the proposed boeing model in flight , 1965

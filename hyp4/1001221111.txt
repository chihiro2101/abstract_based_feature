boeing had worked on a number of small-scale supersonic transport ( sst ) studies since 1952 most of the designs featured a large delta wing , but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of boeing 's efforts in the swing-wing tfx project ( which led to the purchase of the general dynamics f-111 instead of the boeing offering ) in 1960 , an internal competition was run on a baseline 150-seat aircraft for trans-atlantic routes , and the swing-wing version won '' lost classics - boeing 2707-200 sst '' shortly after taking office , president john f kennedy tasked the federal aviation administration with preparing a report on '' national aviation goals for the period between now and 1970 '' the study was prompted in the wake of several accidents , which led to the belief that the industry was becoming moribund two projects were started , project beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control , and project horizon on advanced civil aviation developments only one month later the faa 's new director , najeeb halaby , produced the commission on national aviation goals , better known as project horizon mcnamara was highly skeptical of the sst project and savaged halaby 's predictions ; he was also afraid the project might be turned over to the dod and was careful to press for further studies the basic concept behind the sst was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft , leading to higher utilization these problems were well understood within the industry ; the iata released a set of '' design imperatives '' for an sst that were essentially impossible to meetâ€”the release was a warning to promoters of the sst within the industry '' the history of concorde '' nms.ac.uk in spite of marginal economics , nationalistic and political arguments had led to wide support for the project , especially from charles de gaulle as if this were not enough , it soon became known that the soviets were also working on a similar design a report from the supersonic transport advisory group ( stag ) followed , noting that the european team was in the lead in basic development , and suggested competing by developing a more advanced design with better economics the baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with mach 3 performance with 2,400 mile range in order to serve the domestic market they felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the concorde 's introduction , abandoning the trans-atlantic market to the europeans in spite of vocal opponents , questions about the technical requirements , and extremely negative reports about its economic viability , the sst project gathered strong backing from industry and the faa requests for proposals were sent out to airframe manufacturers boeing , lockheed , and north american for the airframes ; and curtiss-wright , general electric and pratt & whitney for engines boeing 's entry was essentially identical to the swing-wing model 733 studied in 1960 ; it was known officially as the model , but also referred to both as the 1966 model and the model 2707 the blended wing root spanned almost all of cabin area , and this early version had a much more stubby look than the models that would ultimately evolve like the concorde , it featured a long and skinny fuselage , engines under the wing , and a compound delta planform the north american nac-60 was essentially a scaled-up b-70 with a less tapered fuselage and new compound-delta wing both the boeing and lockheed l-2000 designs were presented in september 1966 along with full-scale mock-ups after a lengthy review the boeing design was announced as the winner on january 1 , 1967 the sst mock-up included both overhead storage for smaller items with restraining nets , as well as large drop-in bins between sections of the aircraft boeing predicted that if the go-ahead were given , construction of the sst prototypes would begin in early 1967 and the first flight could be made in early 1970 flightglobal.com flightglobal.com the boeing team fell back on a tailed delta fixed wing work began on a full-sized mock-up and two prototypes in september 1969 , now two years behind schedule '' go ahead for the boeing sst ?

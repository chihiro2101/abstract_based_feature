in the summer of 1793 , the 118,000-strong coalition army punched a gap in the line of french fortresses along the frontier with the austrian netherlands , with the siege of condé concluding on 12 july and the siege of valenciennes on 27 july in the battle of caesar 's camp , the coalition army under prince josias of saxe-coburg-saalfeld hustled the french army of the north out of a position near cambrai on 7 august from 6–8 september , the army of the north under jean nicolas houchard defeated the dunkirk covering force in the battle of hondschoote , compelling the duke of york to give up the siege of dunkirk coburg 's main army concluded the siege of le quesnoy on 13 september , taking 4,000 french troops prisoner two french columns attempted to raise the siege but failed , one of the columns being nearly wiped out by coalition cavalry in the battle of avesnes-le-sec though coburg might have easily seized cambrai and bouchain , which had been stripped of their garrisons to form the relief columns , the coalition commander chose to move against maubeuge instead jean-baptiste jourdan had been wounded at hondschoote and was named to lead the army of the ardennes on 9 september when jourdan protested that he lacked the experience to command the 104,000-man army , the representatives on mission notified him that refusal would result in his arrest the new commander found that he must respond to the coalition 's move against maubeuge coburg 's army began the siege of maubeuge on 30 september joseph souham at dunkirk commanded 8,852 infantry in 17 battalions and 430 cavalry in one regiment and andré gigaux at hondschoote had 7,269 infantry in 15 battalions near cassel , dominique vandamme led 8,984 foot soldiers in 19 battalions and 325 horsemen in one regiment , while

29 september , a column under françois sébastien charles joseph de croix , count of clerfayt crossed the sambre at berlaimont , southwest of maubeuge coburg split his forces into a 26,000-man siege army directed by the prince of orange and an army of observation hoditz directed 9,300 foot and 3,750 horse on the east of maubeuge and clerfayt led 9,000 foot and 4,200 horse on the south side of maubeuge clerfayt divided his corps into three groups under count heinrich von bellegarde , joseph binder von degenschild and ludwig von terzi on the first day , the french garrison sortied against the cense de château but were repulsed after stiff fighting maubeuge was supplied for a normal garrison but far too many soldiers were trapped there on 13 october , the french enjoyed initial success in a sortie against the bois du tilleul , but troops sent out to help mistakenly fired on their own friends and the french were compelled to retreat leaving 10,000 soldiers in the camp of gavrelle to support bouchain and cambrai , jourdan immediately moved to the relief of maubeuge with the remaining 20,000 men without waiting for the troops from the north , jourdan assembled a division under jacques fromentin the next day , several units from the north joined beauregard 's division carrion 's division , now under étienne jean-françois cordellier-delanoüe , counted 6,866 troops including 668 horsemen on the morning of 15 october , bellegarde held the coalition right flank with about 5,000 troops in three battalions of foot and 16 squadrons of horse clerfayt defended the center with 9,200 soldiers , deployed along a west-to-east line of villages supported by division commanders were franz joseph , count kinsky and joseph karl von lilien , clerfayt controlled five battalions of

foot and 12 squadrons of horse from right to left the french divisions were beauregard at solre-le-château , duquesnoy on the main road from avesnes-sur-helpe , balland in reserve at avesnelles , cordellier at la capelle and fromentin at dompierre-sur-helpe supported by a plentiful artillery , the french infantry drove two austrian battalions out of wattignies , but as the french poured out of the other side of the village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack in the afternoon bellegarde launched a counterattack led by austrian regular infantry , while two regiments of cavalry swept down on the french left flank the austrians captured eight french cannon and caused the french to flee to the safety of the ravine the rest of balland 's division was to form line of battle and use its light troops to probe the enemy positions duquesnoy 's division formed the two right columns while jourdan 's detachment made up the left column on 17 october , the garrison sent out a column to the south to meet with jourdan , instead of to the north after the retreating coalition forces jourdan did not follow up his victory ; after adding the maubeuge garrison , he had about 60,000 french soldiers , opposed by 65,000 well-entrenched coalition troops on the north bank of the sambre , from solesmes on the west to thuin on the east jourdan later noted that coburg erred by placing the army of observation too close to maubeuge

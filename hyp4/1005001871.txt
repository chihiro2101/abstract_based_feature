most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays in some cases , more than one clock cycle is required to perform a predictable action the preeminent example of such complex chips is the microprocessor , the central component of modern computers , which relies on a clock from a crystal oscillator a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit most modern synchronous circuits use only a '' single phase clock '' & ndash ; in other words , all clock signals are ( effectively ) transmitted on 1 wire in synchronous circuits , a '' two-phase clock '' refers to clock signals distributed on 2 wires , each with non-overlapping pulses mos ics typically used dual clock signals ( a two-phase clock ) in the 1970s the 6800 has a minimum clock rate of 100 & nbsp ; khz and the 8080 has a minimum clock rate of 500 & nbsp ; khz some early integrated circuits use four-phase logic , requiring a four phase clock input consisting of four separate , non-overlapping clock signals many modern microcomputers use a '' clock multiplier '' which multiplies a lower frequency external clock to the appropriate clock rate of the microprocessor the vast majority of digital devices do not require a clock at a fixed , constant frequency the clock distribution network ( or clock tree , when this network forms a tree ) distributes the clock signal ( s ) from a common point to all the elements that need it often special consideration must be made to meet the timing requirements

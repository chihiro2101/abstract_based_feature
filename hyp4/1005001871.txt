most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays in some cases , more than one clock cycle is required to perform a predictable action the preeminent example of such complex chips is the microprocessor , the central component of modern computers , which relies on a clock from a crystal oscillator a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit this technique is often used to save power by effectively shutting down portions of a digital circuit when they are not in use , but comes at a cost of increased complexity in timing analysis most modern synchronous circuits use only a '' single phase clock '' & ndash ; in other words , all clock signals are ( effectively ) transmitted on 1 wire in synchronous circuits , a '' two-phase clock '' refers to clock signals distributed on 2 wires , each with non-overlapping pulses mos ics typically used dual clock signals ( a two-phase clock ) in the 1970s the mos technology 6502 uses the same 2-phase logic internally , but also includes a two-phase clock generator on-chip , so it only needs a single phase clock input , simplifying system design many modern microcomputers use a '' clock multiplier '' which multiplies a lower frequency external clock to the appropriate clock rate of the microprocessor as long as the minimum and maximum clock periods are respected , the time between clock edges can vary widely from one edge to the next and back again such digital devices work just as well with a clock generator that dynamically changes its frequency , such as spread spectrum clock , dynamic frequency scaling , etc since the data signals are provided with a temporal reference by the clock signals , the clock waveforms must be particularly clean and sharp

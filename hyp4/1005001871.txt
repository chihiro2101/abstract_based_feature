most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays the preeminent example of such complex chips is the microprocessor , the central component of modern computers , which relies on a clock from a crystal oscillator a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit most modern synchronous circuits use only a '' single phase clock '' & ndash ; in other words , all clock signals are ( effectively ) transmitted on 1 wire in synchronous circuits , a '' two-phase clock '' refers to clock signals distributed on 2 wires , each with non-overlapping pulses two-phase clock because the two phases are guaranteed non-overlapping , gated latches rather than edge-triggered flip-flops can be used to store state information so long as the inputs to latches on one phase only depend on outputs from latches on the other phase since a gated latch uses only four gates versus six gates for an edge-triggered flip-flop , a two phase clock can lead to a design with a smaller overall gate count but usually at some penalty in design difficulty and performance mos ics typically used dual clock signals ( a two-phase clock ) in the 1970s many modern microcomputers use a '' clock multiplier '' which multiplies a lower frequency external clock to the appropriate clock rate of the microprocessor as long as the minimum and maximum clock periods are respected , the time between clock edges can vary widely from one edge to the next and back again such digital devices work just as well with a clock generator that dynamically changes its frequency , such as spread spectrum clock , dynamic frequency scaling , etc the clock distribution network ( or clock tree , when this network forms a tree ) distributes the clock signal ( s ) from a common point to all the elements that need it since this function is vital to the operation of a synchronous system , much attention has been given to the characteristics of these clock signals and the electrical networks used in their distribution

most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays in some cases , more than one clock cycle is required to perform a predictable action a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit this technique is often used to save power by effectively shutting down portions of a digital circuit when they are not in use , but comes at a cost of increased complexity in timing analysis most modern synchronous circuits use only a '' single phase clock '' & ndash ; in other words , all clock signals are ( effectively ) transmitted on 1 wire in synchronous circuits , a '' two-phase clock '' refers to clock signals distributed on 2 wires , each with non-overlapping pulses two-phase clock because the two phases are guaranteed non-overlapping , gated latches rather than edge-triggered flip-flops can be used to store state information so long as the inputs to latches on one phase only depend on outputs from latches on the other phase mos ics typically used dual clock signals ( a two-phase clock ) in the 1970s the mos technology 6502 uses the same 2-phase logic internally , but also includes a two-phase clock generator on-chip , so it only needs a single phase clock input , simplifying system design some early integrated circuits use four-phase logic , requiring a four phase clock input consisting of four separate , non-overlapping clock signals as long as the minimum and maximum clock periods are respected , the time between clock edges can vary widely from one edge to the next and back again the clock distribution network ( or clock tree , when this network forms a tree ) distributes the clock signal ( s ) from a common point to all the elements that need it since the data signals are provided with a temporal reference by the clock signals , the clock waveforms must be particularly clean and sharp

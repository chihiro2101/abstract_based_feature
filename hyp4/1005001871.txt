most integrated circuits ( ics ) of sufficient complexity use a clock signal in order to synchronize different parts of the circuit , cycling at a rate slower than the worst-case internal propagation delays in some cases , more than one clock cycle is required to perform a predictable action a clock signal might also be gated , that is , combined with a controlling signal that enables or disables the clock signal for a certain part of a circuit this technique is often used to save power by effectively shutting down portions of a digital circuit when they are not in use , but comes at a cost of increased complexity in timing analysis most modern synchronous circuits use only a '' single phase clock '' & ndash ; in other words , all clock signals are ( effectively ) transmitted on 1 wire in synchronous circuits , a '' two-phase clock '' refers to clock signals distributed on 2 wires , each with non-overlapping pulses mos ics typically used dual clock signals ( a two-phase clock ) in the 1970s the 6800 has a minimum clock rate of 100 & nbsp ; khz and the 8080 has a minimum clock rate of 500 & nbsp ; khz many modern microcomputers use a '' clock multiplier '' which multiplies a lower frequency external clock to the appropriate clock rate of the microprocessor devices that use static logic do not even have a maximum clock period ( or in other words , minimum clock frequency ) ; such devices can be slowed and paused indefinitely , then resumed at full clock speed at any later time the clock distribution network ( or clock tree , when this network forms a tree ) distributes the clock signal ( s ) from a common point to all the elements that need it since this function is vital to the operation of a synchronous system , much attention has been given to the characteristics of these clock signals and the electrical networks used in their distribution the proper design of the clock distribution network helps ensure that critical timing requirements are satisfied and that no race conditions exist ( see also clock skew )

the uap suffered a negative swing of over 40 points in april 1939 , prime minister joseph lyons died in office and was replaced by country party leader earle page on an interim basis fadden did not regard cameron favourably , in one debate stating : '' i take this opportunity to declare without the slightest degree of reservation that the honourable gentleman is not my leader '' when asked in another debate if he were still a member of the country party , he replied '' no , i am not , thank goodness , as it is now constituted and under its present leadership '' arklay ( 2010 ) , p the country party 's coalition with the uap had lapsed following menzies ' elevation to the prime ministership in march 1940 , menzies and cameron agreed to resume the coalition , providing an opportunity for five country party members to be added to the ministry after the crash , fadden replaced fairbairn as minister for air and minister for civil aviation ; he also continued as assistant minister to the treasurer the country party lost three seats to the labor party , and on 16 october the parliamentary party voted to remove archie cameron as leader john mcewen and earle page both nominated for the leadership , and fadden intended to nominate for the deputy leadership during a break for dinner , fadden was asked to become interim leader as a compromise between the two candidates , with the intention that another leadership election would be held in a few months as the acting leader of his party , fadden became the de facto deputy prime minister and joined the advisory war council he was sworn in as treasurer on 28 october 1940 , succeeding percy spender , and presented his first budget less than a month later on 21 november the uap was so bereft of leadership that it was forced to elect 79-year-old former prime minister billy hughes as its new leader indeed , in the lead up to the 1949 election , fadden often made inflammatory claims about the '' socialist '' nature of the labor party which menzies could then '' clarify '' or repudiate as he saw fit , thus appearing more '' moderate '' having continued as treasurer after his resignation as country party leader it was unusual that the treasurer was a member of the junior party of the coalition who was not also the current party leader after fadden 's death , the canberra suburb of fadden and the federal electoral division of fadden were named in his honour , as is traditional for australian prime ministers fadden , arthur ( 1969 ) , they called me artie , jacaranda press colin hughes ( 1976 ) , mr prime minister

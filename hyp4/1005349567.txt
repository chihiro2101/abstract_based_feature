along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells the parrett was navigable up as far as langport in 1600 , with 15 to 20 & nbsp ; ton barges in the middle ages , the monasteries of glastonbury , athelney , and muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage in 1129 , the abbot of glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at lympsham flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th & nbsp ; century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the parrett the river tone was also diverted by the abbot of athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the parrett upstream from its original confluence previously , the cary ran into the tone while the brue ran through meare pool ( now drained ) and the panborough gap , and then into the axe another accomplishment in the middle ages was the construction of the tidal pillrow cut , joining the brue and axe in 1597 , of land were recovered near the parrett estuary ; a few years later , near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling , had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 in 1638 , it was reported that nearly of tealham and tadham moors were not reclaimed , with a total of being undrained between 1785 and 1791 , much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed at westhay moor in the early 19th & nbsp ; century , it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding , creating a very rich soil it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 the first steam pumping station was westonzoyland pumping station in 1830 , followed by more effective ones from 1860 the man-made river huntspill was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of '' process water '' it was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage the sowy river between the river parrett and king 's sedgemoor drain was completed in 1972 the levels and moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into '' drains '' during 2009 and 2010 , work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates , watercourses , and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of southlake moor during the winter diverting water from the sowy river onto the moor in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the parrett and whether it should be sited at bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939 , at the start of world war ii , and have not been resolved wessex water estimated the total cost of the damage caused at £6m construction work started in 1983 on a £7m scheme , creating what was then britain 's biggest sea wall types the environment agency 's current '' parrett catchment flood management plan '' , published in december 2009 , divides the parrett catchment area into eight sub-areas , with the somerset levels and moors falling into sub-area 6 and bridgwater falling into sub-area 7 since 1990 , the drainage boards have been charged with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear , under the overall responsibility of the environment agency although the environment agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding , still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages & nbsp ; — including muchelney and westonzoyland — being cut off rescue boats were again required during the rain and storms from cyclone dirk in the turn of the year 2014 , and subsequently during the winter flooding of 2013–14 on the somerset levels on 24 january 2014 , in light of the continued flooded extent of the somerset moors and forecast new rainfall as part of the winter storms of 2013–14 in the united kingdom , both somerset county council and sedgemoor district council declared a major incident at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater there have been public protests about the river parrett not being dredged in recent years subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people the sweet track , named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s bc , is the world 's oldest timber trackway , once thought to be the world 's oldest engineered roadway the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue the remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby , connecting settlements on the peat bog including the honeygore , abbotts way , bells , bakers , westhay and nidons trackways the two villages within meare pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat , such as tents , windbreaks and animal folds fragments of willow basket were found near the glastonbury lake village , and it was used in the construction of several iron age causeways by the end of the 20th & nbsp ; century only about were grown commercially , near the villages of burrowbridge , westonzoyland , and north curry evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the shapwick heath nature reserve involves the nature conservancy council , the department for environment , food and rural affairs and the somerset levels project also in glastonbury , the somerset rural life museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of somerset , housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to glastonbury abbey the westonzoyland pumping station museum , near the town on the river parrett , is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the levels , dating from the 1830s ; it was closed in the 1950s

along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine in summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the sun heating the land , leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells in the middle ages , the monasteries of glastonbury , athelney , and muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage efforts to control flooding on the parrett were recorded around the same date flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th & nbsp ; century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the parrett the river tone was also diverted by the abbot of athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the parrett upstream from its original confluence in the early 17th century , during the time of king james i , abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of sedgemoor , which the local lords supported but opposed by the commoners who would have lost grazing rights between 1785 and 1791 , much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed at westhay moor in the early 19th & nbsp ; century , it was shown how peat bogs could be successfully drained and top-dressed with silt deposited via flooding , creating a very rich soil the character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of king 's sedgemoor drain the man-made river huntspill was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of '' process water '' the sowy river between the river parrett and king 's sedgemoor drain was completed in 1972 water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh however , idbs have been actively participating with the parrett catchment partnership , a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed , in particular , looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders during 2009 and 2010 , work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates , watercourses , and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of southlake moor during the winter diverting water from the sowy river onto the moor in spring , the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer the scheme is also used to encourage water birds the levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th & nbsp ; century in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the parrett and whether it should be sited at bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939 , at the start of world war ii , and have not been resolved wessex water estimated the total cost of the damage caused at £6m during the great storm of 1703 , waves came four feet ( 1.2 & nbsp ; m ) over the sea walls the sea wall was again breached in 1799 , filling the axe valley with sea water in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years with rising sea levels , the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive , and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people the neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the sweet and post tracks the sweet track , named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s bc , is the world 's oldest timber trackway , once thought to be the world 's oldest engineered roadway the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue the levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the uk , glastonbury lake village , as well as two others at meare lake village discovered in 1892 by arthur bulleid , it was inhabited by about 200 & nbsp ; people living in 14 & nbsp ; roundhouses , and was built on a marsh on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood , bracken , rubble and clay there have been many finds of metalwork during peat cutting , which may have been devotional offerings brent knoll has been settled by people since at least the bronze age the resulting reduction in water levels put local ecosystems at risk ; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1–3 & nbsp ; feet ( 0.3–0.8 & nbsp ; m ) over 100 & nbsp ; years this project , based on the village of shapwick , was begun by mick aston of bristol university to investigate the evolution of a typical english village the avalon marshes centre ( formerly known as the peat moors centre ) between westhay and shapwick , is dedicated to the natural history , biodiversity , archaeology , history , and geology of the area it also includes reconstructions of some archaeological discoveries of the area , such as a roman villa and a saxon longhall the westonzoyland pumping station museum , near the town on the river parrett , is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the levels , dating from the 1830s ; it was closed in the 1950s

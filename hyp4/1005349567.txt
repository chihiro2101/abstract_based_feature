along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country temperateness is less extreme than most of the united kingdom because of the adjacent sea the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 & nbsp ; hours most rainfall in the southwest is caused by convection or low-pressure area , which are most active in autumn and winter , when they are the chief cause of rain the moors and levels , formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape , consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level , with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells in 1129 , the abbot of glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at lympsham efforts to control flooding on the parrett were recorded around the same date the river tone was also diverted by the abbot of athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the parrett upstream from its original confluence in 1638 , it was reported that nearly of tealham and tadham moors were not reclaimed , with a total of being undrained the character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of king 's sedgemoor drain little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water , possibly because the coal-driven newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 the man-made river huntspill was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of '' process water '' geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year the sowy river between the river parrett and king 's sedgemoor drain was completed in 1972 water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh controversy about the management of the drainage and flood protection has previously involved the activities of idbs however , idbs have been actively participating with the parrett catchment partnership , a partnership of 30 organisations that aims to create a consensus on how water is to be managed , in particular , looking at new ways to achieve sustainable benefits for all local stakeholders it has the capacity to hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the parrett internal drainage board to restore ten floodplains in somerset the levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th & nbsp ; century in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it over topping of the sea defences along a stretch of the somerset coast at 22 locations from clevedon to porlock began after 19:30 this resulted in a three-year programme of sea defence assessment , repair and improvement with 400 properties affected in burnham-on-sea , after emergency repairs , wessex water authority began planning new sea defences during the great storm of 1703 , waves came four feet ( 1.2 & nbsp ; m ) over the sea walls the sea wall was again breached in 1799 , filling the axe valley with sea water in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years since 1990 , the drainage boards have been charged with watching the rhynes and keeping them clear , under the overall responsibility of the environment agency with rising sea levels , the work required to maintain the sea defences is likely to become more expensive , and it has been proposed that two inland seas be created although the environment agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding , still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages & nbsp ; — including muchelney and westonzoyland — being cut off at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater there have been public protests about the river parrett not being dredged in recent years subsequent winter flooding probably led to prehistoric man 's using the levels only in the summer , hence the county of somerset may derive its name from sumorsaete , meaning land of the summer people the levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the uk , glastonbury lake village , as well as two others at meare lake village several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural '' islands '' of slightly raised land , including brent knoll , glastonbury , and the low range of the polden hills according to legend ider son of nuth , who was one of king arthur 's knights , went to the mount of frogs on a quest to slay three giants who lived there sea salt was extracted during the roman period , and a string of settlements were set up along the polden hills some possible settlement sites are also known in the draycott and cheddar moors and around highbridge the extraction of peat from the moors is known to have taken place during roman times , and has been carried out since the levels were first drained evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the shapwick heath nature reserve involves the nature conservancy council , the department for environment , food and rural affairs and the somerset levels project list of locations in the somerset levels caldicot and wentloog levels the fens romney marsh geology of somerset east somerset railway

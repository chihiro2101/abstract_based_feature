along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine in december 1998 , there were 20 & nbsp ; days without sun recorded at yeovilton november to march have the highest mean wind speeds , and june to august have the lightest winds early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells the parrett was navigable up as far as langport in 1600 , with 15 to 20 & nbsp ; ton barges in the middle ages , the monasteries of glastonbury , athelney , and muchelney were responsible for much of the drainage in 1129 , the abbot of glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at lympsham efforts to control flooding on the parrett were recorded around the same date in 1234 , were reclaimed near westonzoyland and , from the accounts in the abbey 's rent books , this had increased to by 1240 they included southlake wall , burrow wall , and lake wall the river tone was also diverted by the abbot of athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the parrett upstream from its original confluence the main drainage outlets flowing through the moors and levels are the rivers axe , brue , huntspill , parrett , tone , and yeo , together with the king 's sedgemoor drain , an artificial channel into which the river cary now runs however , the work was delayed by the english civil war and later defeated in parliament after local opposition automatic electric pumps are used today the man-made river huntspill was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of '' process water '' it was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year the sowy river between the river parrett and king 's sedgemoor drain was completed in 1972 one of the approaches to reducing the risk of flooding within the catchment area of the parrett is the planting of new woodlands the levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th & nbsp ; century with 400 properties affected in burnham-on-sea , after emergency repairs , wessex water authority began planning new sea defences the sea wall was again breached in 1799 , filling the axe valley with sea water rescue boats were again required during the rain and storms from cyclone dirk in the turn of the year 2014 , and subsequently during the winter flooding of 2013–14 on the somerset levels at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater in mid-february 2014 the environment agency began installing giant pumps imported from the netherlands to alleviate the continuing flooding later during the 7th & nbsp ; millennium bc the sea level rose and flooded the valleys , forcing the mesolithic people to occupy seasonal camps on the higher ground , indicated by scatters of flints an alternative suggestion is that the name derives from seo-mere-saetan meaning '' settlers by the sea lakes '' the neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the sweet and post tracks the sweet track , named after the peat digger who discovered it in 1970 and dating from the 3800s bc , is the world 's oldest timber trackway , once thought to be the world 's oldest engineered roadway the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue the remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby , connecting settlements on the peat bog including the honeygore , abbotts way , bells , bakers , westhay and nidons trackways the levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the uk , glastonbury lake village , as well as two others at meare lake village clay was later spread over the peat , providing raised stands for occupation , industry and movement , and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone the area continued to be inhabited during the bronze age , when the population supported itself largely by hunting and fishing in the surrounding marshes , living on artificial islands connected by wooden causeways on wooden piles brent knoll has been settled by people since at least the bronze age it is the site of an iron age hill fort known as brent knoll camp , with multiple ramparts ( multivallate ) following the contours of the hill however , over 60 % of somerset 's orchards have been lost in the last fifty years ; and apple production occupies less than 0.4 % of the land an unusual crop is the growing of teazels around the river isle near chard on the heavy clay soils around fivehead a section , which lies within the land owned by the nature conservancy council , has been surrounded by a clay bank to prevent drainage into surrounding lower peat fields , and water levels are regularly monitored the langport & river parrett visitor centre at langport details local life , history , and wildlife somerset wildlife trust british pathé clip shows drainage works at king 's sedgemoor & river brue , 1942 1962 historic film on willow

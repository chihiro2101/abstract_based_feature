along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine in december 1998 , there were 20 & nbsp ; days without sun recorded at yeovilton most rainfall in the southwest is caused by convection or low-pressure area , which are most active in autumn and winter , when they are the chief cause of rain november to march have the highest mean wind speeds , and june to august have the lightest winds early attempts to control the water levels were possibly made by the romans ( although records only date from the 13th & nbsp ; century ) , but were not widespread there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells the parrett was navigable up as far as langport in 1600 , with 15 to 20 & nbsp ; ton barges in 1129 , the abbot of glastonbury was recorded as inspecting enclosed land at lympsham flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th & nbsp ; century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the parrett the main drainage outlets flowing through the moors and levels are the rivers axe , brue , huntspill , parrett , tone , and yeo , together with the king 's sedgemoor drain , an artificial channel into which the river cary now runs another accomplishment in the middle ages was the construction of the tidal pillrow cut , joining the brue and axe in 1597 , of land were recovered near the parrett estuary ; a few years later , near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling , had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 in the early 17th century , during the time of king james i , abortive plans were made to drain and enclose much of sedgemoor , which the local lords supported but opposed by the commoners who would have lost grazing rights in 1638 , it was reported that nearly of tealham and tadham moors were not reclaimed , with a total of being undrained between 1785 and 1791 , much of the lowest part of the peat moors was enclosed little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water , possibly because the coal-driven newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical it was intended that in the summer , when water supply was lower , it would serve as a reservoir with water pumped from the moors ; and in winter serve as a drainage channel , via gravity drainage geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year the sowy river between the river parrett and king 's sedgemoor drain was completed in 1972 the levels and moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into '' drains '' water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh it has the capacity to hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the parrett internal drainage board to restore ten floodplains in somerset the scheme is also used to encourage water birds the levels were frequently flooded by the sea during high tides , a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20th & nbsp ; century in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the parrett and whether it should be sited at bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939 , at the start of world war ii , and have not been resolved meteorological conditions caused a large rising surge in sea level in the bristol channel , and wind was measured at with 400 properties affected in burnham-on-sea , after emergency repairs , wessex water authority began planning new sea defences in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years although the environment agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding , still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages & nbsp ; — including muchelney and westonzoyland — being cut off in november 2012 , during the 2012 great britain and ireland floods , after six days somerset county council-funded barb rescue boats reached muchelney on 29 november , rescuing nearly 100 people rescue boats were again required during the rain and storms from cyclone dirk in the turn of the year 2014 , and subsequently during the winter flooding of 2013–14 on the somerset levels such plan would likely include the dredging of the rivers tone and parrett , and possibly a later sluice near bridgwater in mid-february 2014 the environment agency began installing giant pumps imported from the netherlands to alleviate the continuing flooding a palaeolithic flint tool found in westbury is the earliest indication of human presence in the area , dating from approximately 500,000 years ago the neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways such as the sweet and post tracks the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue the levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the uk , glastonbury lake village , as well as two others at meare lake village several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural '' islands '' of slightly raised land , including brent knoll , glastonbury , and the low range of the polden hills some possible settlement sites are also known in the draycott and cheddar moors and around highbridge they support a vast variety of plant species , including common plants such as marsh marigold , meadowsweet , and ragged robin evaluation and maintenance of water levels in the shapwick heath nature reserve involves the nature conservancy council , the department for environment , food and rural affairs and the somerset levels project list of locations in the somerset levels caldicot and wentloog levels the fens romney marsh geology of somerset east somerset railway

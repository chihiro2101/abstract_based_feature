along with the rest of south west england the somerset levels have a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country the azores high influences the southwest of england 's summer weather , but convection cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine in summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by the sun heating the land , leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms average rainfall is around , and about 8–15 days of snowfall is typical the moors and levels , formed from a submerged and reclaimed landscape , consist of a coastal clay belt only slightly above mean sea level , with an inland peat belt at a lower level behind it there was a port at bleadney on the river axe in the 8th & nbsp ; century which allowed goods to be brought to within of wells in 1200 , a wharf was constructed at rackley near axbridge efforts to control flooding on the parrett were recorded around the same date flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed during the 13th & nbsp ; century by the construction of a number of embankment walls to contain the parrett the river tone was also diverted by the abbot of athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel , joining the parrett upstream from its original confluence previously , the cary ran into the tone while the brue ran through meare pool ( now drained ) and the panborough gap , and then into the axe in 1597 , of land were recovered near the parrett estuary ; a few years later , near pawlett were recovered by means of embankments ; and three further reclamations , totalling , had been undertaken downstream of bridgwater by 1660 in 1632 , charles i sold the crown 's interest in the scheme , and it was taken over by a consortium that included sir cornelius vermuyden , a dutch drainage engineer however , the work was delayed by the english civil war and later defeated in parliament after local opposition the character of the soil was also changed by the spreading of clay and silt from the digging of king 's sedgemoor drain little attempt was made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water , possibly because the coal-driven newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical it is unclear why windmills were not employed , as they were on the fens of east anglia , but only two examples have been recorded on the levels : one at bleadon at the mouth of the river axe , where a sea wall had been built , and the other at common moor north of glastonbury , which was being drained following a private act of parliament in 1721 the man-made river huntspill was constructed during world war ii with sluices at both ends to provide a guaranteed daily supply of of '' process water '' geotechnical problems prevented it from being dug as deep as originally intended and so gravity-drainage of the moors was not possible : thus , water is pumped up into the river throughout the year the levels and moors are now artificially drained by a network of rhynes which are pumped up into '' drains '' water levels are managed by the levels internal drainage boards ( idbs ) ; the levels are not as intensively drained or farmed as the east anglian fens , historically a similar area of low marsh during 2009 and 2010 , work was undertaken to upgrade sluice gates , watercourses , and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of southlake moor during the winter diverting water from the sowy river onto the moor it has the capacity to hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the parrett internal drainage board to restore ten floodplains in somerset in spring , the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer in addition , the problems of high fresh water floods are aggravated by the unrestricted entry of the tide along the parrett , which is the only river in the levels and moors that does not have a clyse on it over topping of the sea defences along a stretch of the somerset coast at 22 locations from clevedon to porlock began after 19:30 the sea wall was again breached in 1799 , filling the axe valley with sea water in 1872 , another flood covered and in 1919 , were inundated with sea water , poisoning the land for up to 7 & nbsp ; years other studies have recommended maintaining the current defences for five years while undertaking further studies of available options although the environment agency have made plans for the regular winter flooding , still in recent years this has resulted in a number of villages & nbsp ; — including muchelney and westonzoyland — being cut off at this time , with of agricultural land having been under water for over a month , the village of thorney had been abandoned and muchelney had been cut off by flood waters for almost a month there have been public protests about the river parrett not being dredged in recent years an alternative suggestion is that the name derives from seo-mere-saetan meaning '' settlers by the sea lakes '' the track was built between what was in the early 4th & nbsp ; millennium bc an island at westhay and a ridge of high ground at shapwick , close to the river brue the levels contain the best-preserved prehistoric village in the uk , glastonbury lake village , as well as two others at meare lake village the two villages within meare pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat , such as tents , windbreaks and animal folds brent knoll has been settled by people since at least the bronze age several settlements and hill forts were built on the natural '' islands '' of slightly raised land , including brent knoll , glastonbury , and the low range of the polden hills it is easy to see why the area acquired a number of legends , particularly of king arthur and his followers , who some believe based his court in the hill fort at south cadbury they had proposed that each pylon would be high : the consultation was only in respect of preferences between two alternate routes , not the size nor the use of large pylons fragments of willow basket were found near the glastonbury lake village , and it was used in the construction of several iron age causeways in 2010 , a project was started to reintroduce the common crane to the levels , after an absence of 400 & nbsp ; years the westonzoyland pumping station museum , near the town on the river parrett , is housed in one of the earliest steam-powered pumping stations on the levels , dating from the 1830s ; it was closed in the 1950s somerset wildlife trust british pathé clip shows drainage works at king 's sedgemoor & river brue , 1942 1962 historic film on willow

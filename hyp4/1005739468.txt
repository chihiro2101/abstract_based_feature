handel and romagopalan commented that '' epigenetics allows the peaceful co-existence of darwinian and lamarckian evolution epigenetics , an emerging field of genetics , has shown that lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along it seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in dna sequence ( genotype ) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factorsâ€”lamarck 's '' acquired traits the prokaryote crispr system and piwi-interacting rna could be classified as lamarckian , within a darwinian framework critics such as the evolutionary biologist jerry coyne point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations , so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change ryan gregory contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered lamarckian '' gregory has stated that lamarckian evolution in epigenetics is more like darwin 's point of view than lamarck's haig argued for the primacy of dna and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection this reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the dna and passed on to subsequent generations the hologenome theory of evolution , while darwinian , has lamarckian aspects within the field of cultural evolution , lamarckism has been applied as a mechanism for dual inheritance theory

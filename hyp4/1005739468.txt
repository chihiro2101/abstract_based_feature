the inheritance of acquired characteristics was proposed in ancient times , and remained a current idea for many centuries the historian of science conway zirkle wrote in 1935 that : methylation similarly mediates epigenetic inheritance in plants such as rice handel and romagopalan commented that '' epigenetics allows the peaceful co-existence of darwinian and lamarckian evolution it seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in dna sequence ( genotype ) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factorsâ€”lamarck 's '' acquired traits critics such as the evolutionary biologist jerry coyne point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations , so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change ryan gregory contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered lamarckian '' gregory has stated that lamarckian evolution in epigenetics is more like darwin 's point of view than lamarck's haig argued for the primacy of dna and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection the hologenome theory of evolution , while darwinian , has lamarckian aspects this somewhat resembles lamarckism but without requiring animals to inherit characteristics acquired by their parents within the field of cultural evolution , lamarckism has been applied as a mechanism for dual inheritance theory

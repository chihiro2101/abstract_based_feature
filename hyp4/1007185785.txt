theobald 's family was from the area around thierville near le bec-hellouin , in the risle valley 11 the modern historian frank barlow speculates that theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop , thomas becket , as becket 's family came from the same part of normandy 23 the exact date of theobald 's birth is unknown ; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man , saltman theobald pp barlow '' theobald '' oxford dictionary of national biography his brother walter also became a priest , and later a bishop bartlett england under the norman and angevin kings p 401 theobald entered the abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century , while william was the third abbot in 1127 theobald was made prior of bec , after boso succeeded william as abbot theobald became abbot in 1137 , davis king stephen p audoen , the bishop of evreux , and brother of thurstan , the archbishop of york , intervened with hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election another problem then arose when hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from theobald , which theobald refused to provide ; no previous abbot had made such a profession theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of peter the venerable , abbot of cluny , allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england 94–97 the election took place on 24 & nbsp ; december ; stephen was present with the papal legate , alberic of ostia , and a small group of barons and bishops , but henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen 's concerns but also because waleran of meulan , the patronage of bec , was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in england waleran and his twin brother robert , earl of leicester , were henry 's chief rivals for stephen 's favour , and henry disliked both of them intensely crouch reign of king stephen pp 15–16 theobald swore fealty to stephen upon his election to canterbury , recognising stephen as the king of england soon after his election theobald selected his brother walter to be archdeacon of canterbury , and in 1148 promoted him to be bishop of rochester 411 theobald attended the council held by stephen in june 1139 that deprived roger of salisbury , bishop of salisbury , and his nephews nigel , bishop of ely , and alexander , bishop of lincoln , of their castles appleby troubled reign of king stephen p 441–442 recently however , that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that theobald took a more active role in the council theobald 's actions in the next few years are intertwined with the history of stephen 's ascension to the throne king henry 's only legitimate son , william , had died in 1120 the norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy , and theobald ii contented himself with his possessions in france 71–73 after the battle of lincoln in 1141 , with stephen in captivity in bristol , theobald did not immediately join the empress he claimed that he needed to talk to stephen before switching his oath of fealty after consulting in person with stephen , he secured permission to accept the current conditions , and then joined henry of blois , who had switched sides , at winchester in april for a synod held to depose stephen and crown matilda as queen 52 after the unsuccessful attempt to crown matilda , those gathered at winchester had to flee before stephen 's forces ; one of matilda 's chief supporters , her half-brother robert of gloucester , was captured henry of blois , having switched sides again , then held another legatine council in westminster , which reaffirmed stephen as king but while matilda was in england , her husband geoffrey was conquering normandy , which he finally overran in 1144 theobald 's dealings with henry of blois , the bishop of winchester , his suffragan bishop , were strained because of henry 's position as papal legate davis king stephen pp to secure appointment as legate , theobald travelled to rome in december 1143 , arriving shortly before celestine 's death on 8 march 1144 theobald was probably accompanied by nigel , bishop of ely , and roger de clinton , bishop of coventry 62 this became the papal policy , and was a significant change from the recognition of stephen as king by pope innocent ii soon after stephen 's coronation in 1135 37 after celestine 's death theobald returned to england , stopping at st denis abbey in paris to help suger , the abbot , consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars theobald was the only bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in france relations at this time between theobald and stephen seem to have been good , saltman theobald p the only english bishop specifically named was henry of blois , but the others who did not attend were presumably also suspended although not named theobald forgave the bishops of exeter , worcester and bath on 11 & nbsp ; november 1148 , according to the later chronicler gervase of canterbury durham may have been omitted because he was a suffragan bishop of the archbishop of york , and his reinstatement was in his archbishop 's hands 26–27 the king was angry with theobald for attending the council , even though the archbishop intervened with eugene , who was displeased with the king for forbidding the bishops ' attendance theobald held the legatine powers in england until his death in 1161 273 who was attempting to secure the succession for his son by imitating the capetian dynasty of france , which usually saw the king 's heir crowned during his father 's lifetime although theobald claimed papal authority for refusal , based on the prohibition by celestine , it was more probable that he and the bishops had no desire to prolong the civil war 135 stephen demanded in april 1152 that theobald crown eustace , but the archbishop once again refused , and went into exile in flanders theobald claimed that stephen had gained the throne through perjury , implying that if the archbishop crowned eustace , theobald would be perpetuating this crime theobald was also present when henry of anjou met with stephen 's second son william , probably after eustace 's death , to settle william 's lands and status after henry succeeded stephen 100–102 later it was mainly theobald and henry of blois who negotiated the treaty ending the civil war , as neither stephen nor henry of anjou was interested in a compromise theobald also had a dispute with st augustine 's abbey over the right of the archbishop to receive annual payments , and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop , which would have been uncanonical , or were for other reasons 429–432 under king stephen , the abbey 's claims prevailed , but after stephen 's death hilary excommunicated the abbot , who appealed to the papacy theobald supported the bishop , who eventually secured a trial before king henry ii 6 theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in england ; the conflict that later arose between henry ii and thomas becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during theobald 's time in office 38 john of salisbury was secretary to theobald for many years , and after theobald 's death became bishop of chartres 595 although theobald was troubled by the opposition of his suffragan henry of blois , he regained control of the english church , secured the rights of his see , and helped maintain the unity of the realm

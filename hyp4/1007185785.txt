theobald 's family was from the area around thierville near le bec-hellouin , in the risle valley 11 the modern historian frank barlow speculates that theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop , thomas becket , as becket 's family came from the same part of normandy 23 the exact date of theobald 's birth is unknown ; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man , saltman theobald pp barlow '' theobald '' oxford dictionary of national biography his brother walter also became a priest , and later a bishop 401 theobald entered the abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century , while william was the third abbot in 1127 theobald was made prior of bec , after boso succeeded william as abbot theobald became abbot in 1137 , davis king stephen p the monks of bec unanimously elected him to be their new abbot without first consulting the archbishop of rouen , hugh de boves , who consequently threatened to void the result audoen , the bishop of evreux , and brother of thurstan , the archbishop of york , intervened with hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of peter the venerable , abbot of cluny , allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh 5 no documents survive from theobald 's tenure as abbot , nor is there any information on the administration of the monastery during his period of office , except that 47 monks were admitted to bec while he was abbot in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england stephen feared that henry would be too powerful as archbishop , and would attempt to control the king waleran and his twin brother robert , earl of leicester , were henry 's chief rivals for stephen 's favour , and henry disliked both of them intensely 91–92 although theobald was pious and well-educated , he had only become abbot the year before , and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery , which had already produced two archbishops of canterbury , lanfranc and anselm 60–61 theobald had no important family connections to advance his career , and few clerical allies matthew king stephen p 110–112 as archbishop his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival , henry of blois 15–16 theobald swore fealty to stephen upon his election to canterbury , recognising stephen as the king of england appleby troubled reign of king stephen p theobald 's actions in the next few years are intertwined with the history of stephen 's ascension to the throne all the magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry 's heir , but when henry i died , stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald ii or matilda could react 71–73 after the battle of lincoln in 1141 , with stephen in captivity in bristol , theobald did not immediately join the empress 52 after the unsuccessful attempt to crown matilda , those gathered at winchester had to flee before stephen 's forces ; one of matilda 's chief supporters , her half-brother robert of gloucester , was captured during their flight theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments theobald ceremonially crowned stephen at canterbury during the christmas court held there the disorders were at their peak between 1142 and 1148 , but her cause could never secure enough support to enable her to be crowned huscroft ruling england pp theobald 's dealings with henry of blois , the bishop of winchester , his suffragan bishop , were strained because of henry 's position as papal legate henry supported the appointment of william of york as archbishop of york in 1141 , which theobald opposed celestine ii was elected on 26 & nbsp ; september 1143 , but he was an opponent of stephen , and thus was not favourably inclined towards stephen 's brother henry either to secure appointment as legate , theobald travelled to rome in december 1143 , arriving shortly before celestine 's death on 8 march 1144 19–22 before his death , celestine forbade theobald '' to allow any change to be made in the position of the english crown , since the transfer of it had been justly denounced , and the matter was still under dispute '' 62 it essentially forbade theobald from crowning any successor to stephen , especially while stephen was still alive theobald was back in paris in may 1147 to meet with the new pope , eugene iii ; among the issues probably discussed was theobald 's dispute with bernard of st david 's relations at this time between theobald and stephen seem to have been good , saltman theobald p matthew king stephen pp crouch reign of king stephen p the only english bishop specifically named was henry of blois , but the others who did not attend were presumably also suspended although not named henry of blois was singled out for special handling , as the papacy ordered that he could not be reinstated by theobald ; eugene reserved to himself the power to restore henry theobald persuaded eugene against excommunicating stephen , asking the pope to allow the king to make amends for his behaviour at first theobald was in exile at st omer , where he consecrated gilbert foliot as bishop of hereford the next year , the archbishop refused to crown eustace and was again exiled by stephen , crouch normans p 273 who was attempting to secure the succession for his son by imitating the capetian dynasty of france , which usually saw the king 's heir crowned during his father 's lifetime although theobald claimed papal authority for refusal , based on the prohibition by celestine , it was more probable that he and the bishops had no desire to prolong the civil war theobald claimed that stephen had gained the throne through perjury , implying that if the archbishop crowned eustace , theobald would be perpetuating this crime theobald was instrumental in the negotiations between henry and stephen that resulted in the treaty of wallingford , securing henry 's succession to the throne 100–102 later it was mainly theobald and henry of blois who negotiated the treaty ending the civil war , as neither stephen nor henry of anjou was interested in a compromise davis king stephen p theobald was present at stephen 's deathbed in october 1154 , and stephen named him as regent until henry could take up the crown 21 after henry 's arrival , theobald crowned henry and his wife eleanor of aquitaine on 19 december 1154 warren henry ii p 56–59 at easter , 1151 , theobald took over the management of the chapter 's estates , as the new prior , walter parvus , was not up to the task not only abbots and priors from within canterbury , but some from other dioceses swore to obey theobald , although normally such oaths would have gone to their diocesan bishop instead 252 theobald also at about the same time granted a mill to his baker named william and some lands to his cook william and the cook 's heirs gervase of canterbury felt that he was too impetuous , probably because of theobald 's treatment of his priors at christ church

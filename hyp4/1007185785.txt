theobald 's family was from the area around thierville near le bec-hellouin , in the risle valley 23 the exact date of theobald 's birth is unknown ; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man , saltman theobald pp barlow '' theobald '' oxford dictionary of national biography his brother walter also became a priest , and later a bishop 401 theobald entered the abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century , while william was the third abbot theobald was the 266th monk admitted under william , out of 346 the historian avrom saltman suggests that , if admissions were spaced regularly throughout william 's abbacy , theobald would have become a monk in about 1117 , but qualifies his estimate with the statement that 1117 '' seems to be rather late '' in 1127 theobald was made prior of bec , after boso succeeded william as abbot theobald became abbot in 1137 , davis king stephen p audoen , the bishop of evreux , and brother of thurstan , the archbishop of york , intervened with hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election another problem then arose when hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from theobald , which theobald refused to provide ; no previous abbot had made such a profession theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of peter the venerable , abbot of cluny , allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh 5 no documents survive from theobald 's tenure as abbot , nor is there any information on the administration of the monastery during his period of office , except that 47 monks were admitted to bec while he was abbot in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england stephen feared that henry would be too powerful as archbishop , and would attempt to control the king henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen 's concerns but also because waleran of meulan , the patronage of bec , was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in england waleran and his twin brother robert , earl of leicester , were henry 's chief rivals for stephen 's favour , and henry disliked both of them intensely crouch reign of king stephen pp 91–92 although theobald was pious and well-educated , he had only become abbot the year before , and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery , which had already produced two archbishops of canterbury , lanfranc and anselm 15–16 theobald swore fealty to stephen upon his election to canterbury , recognising stephen as the king of england soon after his election theobald selected his brother walter to be archdeacon of canterbury , and in 1148 promoted him to be bishop of rochester appleby troubled reign of king stephen p the norman barons accepted stephen as duke of normandy , and theobald ii contented himself with his possessions in france he claimed that he needed to talk to stephen before switching his oath of fealty davis king stephen p theobald ceremonially crowned stephen at canterbury during the christmas court held there the disorders were at their peak between 1142 and 1148 , but her cause could never secure enough support to enable her to be crowned theobald 's dealings with henry of blois , the bishop of winchester , his suffragan bishop , were strained because of henry 's position as papal legate celestine ii was elected on 26 & nbsp ; september 1143 , but he was an opponent of stephen , and thus was not favourably inclined towards stephen 's brother henry either to secure appointment as legate , theobald travelled to rome in december 1143 , arriving shortly before celestine 's death on 8 march 1144 theobald was probably accompanied by nigel , bishop of ely , and roger de clinton , bishop of coventry 62 this became the papal policy , and was a significant change from the recognition of stephen as king by pope innocent ii soon after stephen 's coronation in 1135 davis king stephen p 24 but when eugene summoned the english bishops to the council of rheims in april 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated : chichester , hereford and norwich despite having been specifically refused permission theobald sneaked away in a fishing boat , presumably accompanied by gilbert foliot , who attended the council with him 99 theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king : chiefly his obedience to the pope 's order commanding his attendance , but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected archbishop of york , henry murdac , in the disputes between york and canterbury matthew king stephen pp henry of blois was singled out for special handling , as the papacy ordered that he could not be reinstated by theobald ; eugene reserved to himself the power to restore henry theobald appears to have reinstated most of the bishops quickly , as foliot wrote later in 1148 that only the bishops of winchester , durham , worcester , bath and exeter were still suspended 26–27 the king was angry with theobald for attending the council , even though the archbishop intervened with eugene , who was displeased with the king for forbidding the bishops ' attendance theobald persuaded eugene against excommunicating stephen , asking the pope to allow the king to make amends for his behaviour but stephen was unimpressed with theobald 's intercession ; he confiscated theobald 's property and banished the archbishop in september 1148 , the pope put england under interdict , which was ignored except in canterbury henry of blois had lost his legateship before celestine became pope , but it was not until about 1150 that theobald was appointed legate by eugene iii , perhaps owing to the exhortations of bernard of clairvaux in 1151 theobald held a synod in london 131 the council was attended by the king and eustace , the king 's eldest son , as well as other members of the nobility the council decreed eight canons , or ecclesiastical statutes , including ones condemning the pillaging of church properties and the imposition of financial levies on the clergy 135 stephen demanded in april 1152 that theobald crown eustace , but the archbishop once again refused , and went into exile in flanders 354 the king and the archbishop reached a truce in august theobald was instrumental in the negotiations between henry and stephen that resulted in the treaty of wallingford , securing henry 's succession to the throne 16 pope eugene iii forced stephen to reverse the sentence of banishment , and theobald returned to his see davis king stephen p theobald was present at stephen 's deathbed in october 1154 , and stephen named him as regent until henry could take up the crown eventually , however , pope eugene iii ordered theobald to allow silvester to take up the office , which theobald did in august 1152 theobald supported the bishop , who eventually secured a trial before king henry ii 38 john of salisbury was secretary to theobald for many years , and after theobald 's death became bishop of chartres

theobald 's family was from the area around thierville near le bec-hellouin , in the risle valley 11 the modern historian frank barlow speculates that theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop , thomas becket , as becket 's family came from the same part of normandy 23 the exact date of theobald 's birth is unknown ; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man , saltman theobald pp barlow '' theobald '' oxford dictionary of national biography his brother walter also became a priest , and later a bishop 401 theobald entered the abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century , while william was the third abbot but as william was abbot from 1096 to 1124 , that leaves a wide range of possible entry dates theobald became abbot in 1137 , davis king stephen p the monks of bec unanimously elected him to be their new abbot without first consulting the archbishop of rouen , hugh de boves , who consequently threatened to void the result audoen , the bishop of evreux , and brother of thurstan , the archbishop of york , intervened with hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of peter the venerable , abbot of cluny , allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh theobald travelled to england on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy , to supervise the monastery 's lands in england , a trip that took place shortly before his selection as the new archbishop of canterbury in 1138 in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england stephen feared that henry would be too powerful as archbishop , and would attempt to control the king henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen 's concerns but also because waleran of meulan , the patronage of bec , was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in england waleran and his twin brother robert , earl of leicester , were henry 's chief rivals for stephen 's favour , and henry disliked both of them intensely he went to rome for his pallium and took part in the second lateran council 110–112 as archbishop his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival , henry of blois 15–16 theobald swore fealty to stephen upon his election to canterbury , recognising stephen as the king of england soon after his election theobald selected his brother walter to be archdeacon of canterbury , and in 1148 promoted him to be bishop of rochester 411 theobald attended the council held by stephen in june 1139 that deprived roger of salisbury , bishop of salisbury , and his nephews nigel , bishop of ely , and alexander , bishop of lincoln , of their castles appleby troubled reign of king stephen p all the magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry 's heir , but when henry i died , stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald ii or matilda could react but matilda was not resigned to the loss , and secured the support of the scottish king , david , her maternal uncle , and in 1138 the support of her half-brother , robert , earl of gloucester , an illegitimate son of henry i 71–73 after the battle of lincoln in 1141 , with stephen in captivity in bristol , theobald did not immediately join the empress he claimed that he needed to talk to stephen before switching his oath of fealty henry of blois , having switched sides again , then held another legatine council in westminster , which reaffirmed stephen as king theobald ceremonially crowned stephen at canterbury during the christmas court held there theobald was probably accompanied by nigel , bishop of ely , and roger de clinton , bishop of coventry 62 it essentially forbade theobald from crowning any successor to stephen , especially while stephen was still alive theobald was the only bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in france meanwhile , henry of blois had arrived in rome and begun negotiations with the new pope , lucius ii , over the elevation of the bishopric of winchester to an archbishopric it appears that lucius appointed a legate , cardinal icmar , the bishop of tusculum , to travel to england and oversee the project , but lucius died before anything was accomplished theobald was back in paris in may 1147 to meet with the new pope , eugene iii ;

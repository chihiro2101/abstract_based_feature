11 the modern historian frank barlow speculates that theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop , thomas becket , as becket 's family came from the same part of normandy 23 the exact date of theobald 's birth is unknown ; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man , saltman theobald pp barlow '' theobald '' oxford dictionary of national biography his brother walter also became a priest , and later a bishop 401 theobald entered the abbey of bec in normandy as a benedictine monk in the late 11th or early 12th century , while william was the third abbot the historian avrom saltman suggests that , if admissions were spaced regularly throughout william 's abbacy , theobald would have become a monk in about 1117 , but qualifies his estimate with the statement that 1117 '' seems to be rather late '' in 1127 theobald was made prior of bec , after boso succeeded william as abbot theobald became abbot in 1137 , davis king stephen p another problem then arose when hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from theobald , which theobald refused to provide ; no previous abbot had made such a profession theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of peter the venerable , abbot of cluny , allowing theobald to give a verbal profession to hugh 5 no documents survive from theobald 's tenure as abbot , nor is there any information on the administration of the monastery during his period of office , except that 47 monks were admitted to bec while he was abbot theobald travelled to england on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy , to supervise the monastery 's lands in england , a trip that took place shortly before his selection as the new archbishop of canterbury in 1138 in 1138 king stephen chose theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of canterbury over stephen 's own brother henry , the bishop of winchester , who had helped stephen gain the throne of england 94–97 the election took place on 24 & nbsp ; december ; stephen was present with the papal legate , alberic of ostia , and a small group of barons and bishops , but henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons henry believed that theobald had been elected not only because of stephen 's concerns but also because waleran of meulan , the patronage of bec , was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in england waleran and his twin brother robert , earl of leicester , were henry 's chief rivals for stephen 's favour , and henry disliked both of them intensely crouch reign of king stephen pp appleby troubled reign of king stephen pp matthew king stephen p 110–112 as archbishop his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival , henry of blois 15–16 theobald swore fealty to stephen upon his election to canterbury , recognising stephen as the king of england soon after his election theobald selected his brother walter to be archdeacon of canterbury , and in 1148 promoted him to be bishop of rochester 411 theobald attended the council held by stephen in june 1139 that deprived roger of salisbury , bishop of salisbury , and his nephews nigel , bishop of ely , and alexander , bishop of lincoln , of their castles all the magnates of england and normandy were required to declare fealty to matilda as henry 's heir , but when henry i died , stephen rushed to england and had himself crowned before either theobald ii or matilda could react after consulting in person with stephen , he secured permission to accept the current conditions , and then joined henry of blois , who had switched sides , at winchester in april for a synod held to depose stephen and crown matilda as queen 52 after the unsuccessful attempt to crown matilda , those gathered at winchester had to flee before stephen 's forces ; one of matilda 's chief supporters , her half-brother robert of gloucester , was captured during their flight theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments theobald then took a leading part in the negotiations that led to the exchange of robert for stephen , which happened in november 1141 henry of blois , having switched sides again , then held another legatine council in westminster , which reaffirmed stephen as king theobald ceremonially crowned stephen at canterbury during the christmas court held there nor could stephen decisively defeat matilda 's forces , which meant that england remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals davis king stephen pp to secure appointment as legate , theobald travelled to rome in december 1143 , arriving shortly before celestine 's death on 8 march 1144 19–22 before his death , celestine forbade theobald '' to allow any change to be made in the position of the english crown , since the transfer of it had been justly denounced , and the matter was still under dispute '' quoted in davis king stephen p 62 this became the papal policy , and was a significant change from the recognition of stephen as king by pope innocent ii soon after stephen 's coronation in 1135 62 it essentially forbade theobald from crowning any successor to stephen , especially while stephen was still alive 37 after celestine 's death theobald returned to england , stopping at st denis abbey in paris to help suger , the abbot , consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars it appears that lucius appointed a legate , cardinal icmar , the bishop of tusculum , to travel to england and oversee the project , but lucius died before anything was accomplished relations at this time between theobald and stephen seem to have been good , saltman theobald p henry of blois was singled out for special handling , as the papacy ordered that he could not be reinstated by theobald ; eugene reserved to himself the power to restore henry theobald appears to have reinstated most of the bishops quickly , as foliot wrote later in 1148 that only the bishops of winchester , durham , worcester , bath and exeter were still suspended but stephen was unimpressed with theobald 's intercession ; he confiscated theobald 's property and banished the archbishop from there he conducted the ecclesiastical business of england , but theobald 's presence in the country posed a threat to stephen 's authority , and stephen quickly settled the differences between the two henry of blois had lost his legateship before celestine became pope , but it was not until about 1150 that theobald was appointed legate by eugene iii , perhaps owing to the exhortations of bernard of clairvaux theobald held the legatine powers in england until his death in 1161 131 the council was attended by the king and eustace , the king 's eldest son , as well as other members of the nobility the next year , the archbishop refused to crown eustace and was again exiled by stephen , crouch normans p 135 stephen demanded in april 1152 that theobald crown eustace , but the archbishop once again refused , and went into exile in flanders theobald claimed that stephen had gained the throne through perjury , implying that if the archbishop crowned eustace , theobald would be perpetuating this crime 354 the king and the archbishop reached a truce in august theobald was instrumental in the negotiations between henry and stephen that resulted in the treaty of wallingford , securing henry 's succession to the throne the abbey had never received a papal exemption , but relied instead on its royal foundation by king william i of england and its status as an eigenkirche , or proprietary church of the king 85–88 while still in normandy , theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law , which he continued after being elected archbishop 252 theobald also at about the same time granted a mill to his baker named william and some lands to his cook william and the cook 's heirs gervase of canterbury felt that he was too impetuous , probably because of theobald 's treatment of his priors at christ church

october – november 2009 , california institute of technology '' david baltimore , 1975 nobel laureate and one of the nation 's best-known scientists , is a good case in point '' it was at this program that he met howard temin , with whom he would later share the nobel prize there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology they invited him to apply to the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years there he made fundamental discoveries on virus replication and its effect on cell metabolism , including the first description of an rna replicase after his phd , baltimore returned to mit for postdoctoral research with james darnell in 1963 he continued his work on virus replication using poliovirus and pursued training in enzymology with jerard hurwitz at albert einstein college of medicine in 1964/1965 in february 1965 , baltimore was recruited by renato dulbecco to the newly established salk institute for biological studies in la jolla as an independent research associate there he investigated poliovirus rna replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists ' early careers including marc girard , and michael jacobson he also met his future wife , alice huang , who began working with baltimore at salk in 1967 he and alice together carried out key experiments on defective interfering particles and viral pseudo types during this work , he made a key discovery that polio produced its viral proteins as a single large polyprotein that was subsequently processed into individual functional peptides in 1968 , he was recruited once more by soon-to-be nobel laureate salvador luria to the department of biology at mit as an associate professor of microbiology huang also moved to mit to continue her research on vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) in doing so , he discovered a distinct class of viruses , later called retroviruses , that use an rna template to catalyze synthesis of viral dna reverse transcriptase is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses , allowing such viruses to turn viral rna strands into viral dna strands in 1972 , at the age of 34 , baltimore was awarded tenure as a professor of biology at mit , a post that he held until 1997 in 1973 , he was awarded a prestigious american cancer society professor of microbiology that provided substantial salary support luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including baltimore , phillips robbins , herman eisen , philip sharp , and robert weinberg , who all went on to illustrious research careers baltimore was honored as a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1974 '' at the time , baltimore 's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as hiv and was discovered independently , and at about the same time , by satoshi mizutani and temin he tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of abelson murine leukemia virus ( amulv ) , lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology whitehead institute for biomedical research '' jack '' whitehead , baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project important breakthroughs from baltimore 's lab include the discovery of the key transcription factor nf-κb by dr nf-κb is involved in regulating cellular responses and belongs to the category of '' rapid-acting '' primary transcription factors he moved his research group to new york in stages and continued to make creative contributions to virology and cellular regulation he also began important reforms in fiscal and faculty management and promoted the status of junior faculty at the university on may 13 , 1997 , baltimore was appointed president of the caltech ( caltech ) a3 hotz , robert lee ( may 14 , 1997 ) '' prominent biology nobelist chosen to head caltech ; controversial and outspoken scientist david baltimore says his appointment reflects school 's desire for bigger role in nation 's scientific debates wolff were invited by the national academy of sciences and the institute of medicine to coauthor an independent report : confronting aids ( 1986 ) , in which they called for a 1 billion research program for hiv/aids he was elected a list of fellows of the royal society elected in 1987 ; the french academy of sciences , 2000 ; and the american association for cancer research ( aacr ) in 1986 , while a professor of biology at mit and director at whitehead , baltimore co-authored a scientific paper on immunology with thereza imanishi-kari ( an assistant professor of biology who had her own laboratory at mit ) as well as four others baltimore ( 1986 ) molecular cell biology , scientific american , new york , new york nobel prize video interview '' the discover magazine interview with david baltimore '' upon his retirement from the presidency of caltech in 2006 pbs interview with baltimore on aids , hepatitis , vaccines and science politics

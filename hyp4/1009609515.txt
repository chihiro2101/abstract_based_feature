baltimore was born on march 7 , 1938 , in new york city to gertrude ( lipschitz ) and richard baltimore david baltimore – interviewed by sara lippincott ; october – november 2009 , california institute of technology the 60-year-old baltimore , who graduated from great neck high school in 1956 '' it was at this program that he met howard temin , with whom he would later share the nobel prize 2016 , baltimore earned his bachelor of arts with high honors at swarthmore college in 1960 he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years he took the cold spring harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to richard franklin 's lab at the rockefeller institute at new york city which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology there he made fundamental discoveries on virus replication and its effect on cell metabolism , including the first description of an rna replicase after his phd , baltimore returned to mit for postdoctoral research with james darnell in 1963 in february 1965 , baltimore was recruited by renato dulbecco to the newly established salk institute for biological studies in la jolla as an independent research associate there he investigated poliovirus rna replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists ' early careers including marc girard , and michael jacobson he also met his future wife , alice huang , who began working with baltimore at salk in 1967 huang also moved to mit to continue her research on vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) at mit , huang , baltimore , and graduate student martha stampfer discovered that vsv involved an rna-dependent rna polymerase within the virus particle , and used a novel replication strategy to replicate its rna genome baltimore extended this work and examined two rna tumor viruses , murine leukemia virus and rous sarcoma virus he went on to discover reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) – the enzyme that polymerizes dna from an rna template in doing so , he discovered a distinct class of viruses , later called retroviruses , that use an rna template to catalyze synthesis of viral dna this overturned the simplified version of the central dogma of molecular biology that stated that genetic information flows unidirectionally from dna to rna to proteins baltimore also helped paul berg and maxine singer to organize the asilomar conference on recombinant dna , held in february 1975 baltimore was honored as a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1974 in 1975 , at the age of 37 , he shared the nobel prize for physiology or medicine with howard temin and renato dulbecco he tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of abelson murine leukemia virus ( amulv ) , lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology in 1980 , his group isolated the oncogene in amulv and showed it was a member of a new class of protein kinases that used the amino acid tyrosine as a phosphoacceptor the plasmid dna was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced '' as early as 1984 , rudolf grosschedl and david weaver , postdoctoral fellows , in baltimore 's laboratory , were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease this was a key discovery in determining how the immune system can have specificity for a given molecule out of many possibilities , and was considered by baltimore as of 2005 to be '' our most significant discovery in immunology '' this work helped to identify a class of proteins that become hyperactive in specific types of cancer cells baltimore served as the director of the whitehead institute until july 1 , 1990 , when he was appointed the sixth president of rockefeller university in new york city after resigning on december 3 , 1991 , baltimore remained on the rockefeller university faculty and continued research until spring of 1994 california institute of technology a1 , 22 , 23 '' a luminary of science for caltech 's presidency ; nobelist baltimore has the needed background and clout during baltimore 's tenure at caltech , united states president bill clinton awarded baltimore the national medal of science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world in 2004 , rockefeller university gave baltimore its highest honor , doctor of science ( honoris causa ) in 2003 , as a postdoctoral fellow in david baltimore 's lab at caltech , matthew porteus was the first to demonstrate precise gene editing in human cells using chimeric nucleases in october 2005 , baltimore resigned the office of the president at caltech ( see luk van parijs case ) baltimore recently joined with other scientists to call for a worldwide moratorium on use of a new genome-editing technique to alter inheritable human dna in addition to his influence on public policy for recombinant dna research , baltimore has influenced national policy concerning the aids epidemic amid concerns raised by negative publicity in connection with the scandal , baltimore resigned as president of rockefeller university and rejoined the mit biology faculty baltimore ( 1986 ) molecular cell biology , scientific american , new york , new york

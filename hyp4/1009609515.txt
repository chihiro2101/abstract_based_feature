baltimore was born on march 7 , 1938 , in new york city to gertrude ( lipschitz ) and richard baltimore raised in the queens neighborhoods of forest hills and rego park , queens , he moved with his family to suburban great neck , new york while he was in second grade because his mother felt that the city schools were inadequate '' david baltimore , 1975 nobel laureate and one of the nation 's best-known scientists , is a good case in point he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years after his phd , baltimore returned to mit for postdoctoral research with james darnell in 1963 in february 1965 , baltimore was recruited by renato dulbecco to the newly established salk institute for biological studies in la jolla as an independent research associate there he investigated poliovirus rna replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists ' early careers including marc girard , and michael jacobson he also met his future wife , alice huang , who began working with baltimore at salk in 1967 he and alice together carried out key experiments on defective interfering particles and viral pseudo types during this work , he made a key discovery that polio produced its viral proteins as a single large polyprotein that was subsequently processed into individual functional peptides huang also moved to mit to continue her research on vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) at mit , huang , baltimore , and graduate student martha stampfer discovered that vsv involved an rna-dependent rna polymerase within the virus particle , and used a novel replication strategy to replicate its rna genome vsv entered a host cell as a single negative strand of rna , but brought with it rna polymerase to stimulate the processes of transcription and replication of more rna baltimore extended this work and examined two rna tumor viruses , murine leukemia virus and rous sarcoma virus in doing so , he discovered a distinct class of viruses , later called retroviruses , that use an rna template to catalyze synthesis of viral dna this discovery made it easier to isolate and reproduce individual genes , and was heralded as evidence that molecular and virological approaches to understanding cancer would yield new cures for the dreaded disease this may have influenced president richard nixon 's war on cancer which was launched in 1971 and substantially increased research funding for the disease baltimore was well aware of the importance of the changes occurring in the laboratory : '' the whole asilomar process opened up to the world that modern biology had new powers that you had never conceived of before in 1973 , he was awarded a prestigious american cancer society professor of microbiology that provided substantial salary support luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including baltimore , phillips robbins , herman eisen , philip sharp , and robert weinberg , who all went on to illustrious research careers '' at the time , baltimore 's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as hiv and was discovered independently , and at about the same time , by satoshi mizutani and temin he tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of abelson murine leukemia virus ( amulv ) , lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology they devised a unique structure of an independent research institute composed of '' members '' with a close relationship with the department of biology of mit baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project their discovery led to an '' information explosion '' involving '' one of the most intensely studied signaling paradigms of the last two decades '' as early as 1984 , rudolf grosschedl and david weaver , postdoctoral fellows , in baltimore 's laboratory , were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease they suggested that '' control of lg gene rearrangement might be the only mechanism that determines the specificity of heavy chain gene expression within the lymphoid cell lineage in 1990 , as a student in david baltimore 's laboratory at mit , george q gleevec has shown impressive results in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia and also promise in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) he also began important reforms in fiscal and faculty management and promoted the status of junior faculty at the university cottrell professor of molecular biology and immunology in 2003 , as a postdoctoral fellow in david baltimore 's lab at caltech , matthew porteus was the first to demonstrate precise gene editing in human cells using chimeric nucleases reminiscent of the asilomar conference on recombinant dna in 1975 , those involved want both scientists and the public to be more aware of the ethical issues and risks involved with new techniques for genome modification wolff were invited by the national academy of sciences and the institute of medicine to coauthor an independent report : confronting aids ( 1986 ) , in which they called for a 1 billion research program for hiv/aids gladwell , malcolm ( july 14 , 1992 ) '' prosecutors halt scientific fraud probe ; researcher baltimore claims vindication , plans to 'unretract ' paper '' horace freeland judson also gives a critical assessment of baltimore 's actions in the great betrayal : fraud in science it found van parijs alone committed research misconduct , and that four papers co-authored by baltimore , van parijs , and others required correction nobel prize video interview '' the discover magazine interview with david baltimore '' upon his retirement from the presidency of caltech in 2006 pbs interview with baltimore on aids , hepatitis , vaccines and science politics

baltimore was born on march 7 , 1938 , in new york city to gertrude ( lipschitz ) and richard baltimore his father had been raised as an orthodox jew and his mother was an atheist , and baltimore observed jewish holidays and would attend synagogue with his father through his bar mitzvah david baltimore – interviewed by sara lippincott ; october – november 2009 , california institute of technology '' david baltimore , 1975 nobel laureate and one of the nation 's best-known scientists , is a good case in point '' it was at this program that he met howard temin , with whom he would later share the nobel prize 2016 , baltimore earned his bachelor of arts with high honors at swarthmore college in 1960 he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years he took the cold spring harbor course on animal virology in 1961 and he moved to richard franklin 's lab at the rockefeller institute at new york city which was one of the few labs pioneering molecular research on animal virology he continued his work on virus replication using poliovirus and pursued training in enzymology with jerard hurwitz at albert einstein college of medicine in 1964/1965 in february 1965 , baltimore was recruited by renato dulbecco to the newly established salk institute for biological studies in la jolla as an independent research associate there he investigated poliovirus rna replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists ' early careers including marc girard , and michael jacobson he also met his future wife , alice huang , who began working with baltimore at salk in 1967 in 1968 , he was recruited once more by soon-to-be nobel laureate salvador luria to the department of biology at mit as an associate professor of microbiology vsv entered a host cell as a single negative strand of rna , but brought with it rna polymerase to stimulate the processes of transcription and replication of more rna the discovery of reverse transcriptase , made contemporaneously with howard temin , who had proposed the provirus hypothesis , showed that genetic information could traffic bidirectionally between dna and rna baltimore also helped paul berg and maxine singer to organize the asilomar conference on recombinant dna , held in february 1975 baltimore was well aware of the importance of the changes occurring in the laboratory : '' the whole asilomar process opened up to the world that modern biology had new powers that you had never conceived of before also in 1973 , he became one of the early faculty members in the newly organized mit center for cancer ( ccr ) , capping a creative and industrious period of his career with nearly fifty research publications including the paradigm-shifting paper on reverse transcriptase luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including baltimore , phillips robbins , herman eisen , philip sharp , and robert weinberg , who all went on to illustrious research careers baltimore was honored as a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1974 he returned to new york city in 1975 , for a year-long sabbatical at rockefeller university working with jim darnell '' at the time , baltimore 's greatest contribution to virology was his discovery of reverse transcriptase ( rtase or rt ) which is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses such as hiv and was discovered independently , and at about the same time , by satoshi mizutani and temin after winning the nobel prize , baltimore reorganized his laboratory , refocusing on immunology and virology , with immunoglobulin gene expression as a major area of interest he tackled new problems such as the pathogenesis of abelson murine leukemia virus ( amulv ) , lymphocyte differentiation and related topic in immunology the plasmid dna was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced '' jack '' whitehead , baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project their discovery led to an '' information explosion '' involving '' one of the most intensely studied signaling paradigms of the last two decades '' as early as 1984 , rudolf grosschedl and david weaver , postdoctoral fellows , in baltimore 's laboratory , were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease in 1990 , as a student in david baltimore 's laboratory at mit , george q baltimore served as the director of the whitehead institute until july 1 , 1990 , when he was appointed the sixth president of rockefeller university in new york city he moved his research group to new york in stages and continued to make creative contributions to virology and cellular regulation after resigning on december 3 , 1991 , baltimore remained on the rockefeller university faculty and continued research until spring of 1994 in 2006 baltimore was elected to a three-year term as president of the american association for the advancement of science ( aaas ) during the late 1980s and early 1990s , thereza imanishi-kari , a scientist who was not in baltimore 's laboratory but in a separate , independent laboratory at mit , was implicated in a case of scientific fraud gladwell , malcolm ( july 14 , 1992 ) '' prosecutors halt scientific fraud probe ; researcher baltimore claims vindication , plans to 'unretract ' paper '' '' soon after , at baltimore 's request , caltech began investigating the work luk van parijs had conducted while a postdoc in baltimore 's laboratory baltimore ( 1986 ) molecular cell biology , scientific american

baltimore was born on march 7 , 1938 , in new york city to gertrude ( lipschitz ) and richard baltimore david baltimore – interviewed by sara lippincott ; october – november 2009 , california institute of technology '' but she was also committed to her family and to my father 's right to have his religion , and we celebrated the major holidays , we fasted on yom kippur , and i walked with my father to the shul , which was a long walk from where we lived '' david baltimore , 1975 nobel laureate and one of the nation 's best-known scientists , is a good case in point 2016 , baltimore earned his bachelor of arts with high honors at swarthmore college in 1960 he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years his early interest in phage genetics quickly yielded to a passion for animal viruses after his phd , baltimore returned to mit for postdoctoral research with james darnell in 1963 there he investigated poliovirus rna replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists ' early careers including marc girard , and michael jacobson he also met his future wife , alice huang , who began working with baltimore at salk in 1967 he and alice together carried out key experiments on defective interfering particles and viral pseudo types in 1968 , he was recruited once more by soon-to-be nobel laureate salvador luria to the department of biology at mit as an associate professor of microbiology vsv entered a host cell as a single negative strand of rna , but brought with it rna polymerase to stimulate the processes of transcription and replication of more rna baltimore extended this work and examined two rna tumor viruses , murine leukemia virus and rous sarcoma virus in doing so , he discovered a distinct class of viruses , later called retroviruses , that use an rna template to catalyze synthesis of viral dna reverse transcriptase is essential for the reproduction of retroviruses , allowing such viruses to turn viral rna strands into viral dna strands this may have influenced president richard nixon 's war on cancer which was launched in 1971 and substantially increased research funding for the disease baltimore was honored as a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1974 the plasmid dna was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced the infectious clone , dna encoding the genome of a virus , is a standard tool used today in virology whitehead institute for biomedical research '' jack '' whitehead , baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project during this time , baltimore 's own research program thrived in the new institute nf-κb is involved in regulating cellular responses and belongs to the category of '' rapid-acting '' primary transcription factors this work helped to identify a class of proteins that become hyperactive in specific types of cancer cells gleevec has shown impressive results in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia and also promise in treating gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) baltimore served as the director of the whitehead institute until july 1 , 1990 , when he was appointed the sixth president of rockefeller university in new york city he also began important reforms in fiscal and faculty management and promoted the status of junior faculty at the university during baltimore 's tenure at caltech , united states president bill clinton awarded baltimore the national medal of science in 1999 for his numerous contributions to the scientific world in october 2005 , baltimore resigned the office of the president at caltech ( see luk van parijs case ) baltimore recently joined with other scientists to call for a worldwide moratorium on use of a new genome-editing technique to alter inheritable human dna he was elected a list of fellows of the royal society elected in 1987 ; the french academy of sciences , 2000 ; and the american association for cancer research ( aacr ) o'toole soon dropped her challenge , but the nih , which had funded the contested paper 's research , began investigating , at the insistence of walter w '' neither osi nor ori ever accused baltimore of research misconduct in october 2005 , baltimore resigned the office of the president of caltech , saying , '' this is not a decision that i have made easily , but i am convinced that the interests of the institute will be best served by a presidential transition at this particular time in its history '' soon after , at baltimore 's request , caltech began investigating the work luk van parijs had conducted while a postdoc in baltimore 's laboratory it found van parijs alone committed research misconduct , and that four papers co-authored by baltimore , van parijs , and others required correction baltimore ( 1986 ) molecular cell biology , scientific american , new york , new york

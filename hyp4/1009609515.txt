baltimore was born on march 7 , 1938 , in new york city to gertrude ( lipschitz ) and richard baltimore david baltimore – interviewed by sara lippincott ; october – november 2009 , california institute of technology '' he graduated from great neck north high school in 1956 , and credits his interest in biology to a high-school summer spent at the jackson laboratory 's summer student program in bar harbor , maine '' it was at this program that he met howard temin , with whom he would later share the nobel prize he was introduced to molecular biology by george streisinger under whose mentorship he worked for a summer at cold spring harbor laboratory as part of the inaugural cohort of the undergraduate research program in 1959 there he also met two new mit faculty , future nobel laureate salvador luria and cyrus levinthal who were scouting for candidates for a new program of graduate education in molecular biology baltimore 's future promise was evident in his work as a graduate student when he entered mit 's graduate program in biology in 1960 with a brash and brilliant approach to learning science , completing his phd thesis work in 2 years after his phd , baltimore returned to mit for postdoctoral research with james darnell in 1963 in february 1965 , baltimore was recruited by renato dulbecco to the newly established salk institute for biological studies in la jolla as an independent research associate there he investigated poliovirus rna replication and began a long and storied career of mentoring other scientists ' early careers including marc girard , and michael jacobson he also met his future wife , alice huang , who began working with baltimore at salk in 1967 in 1968 , he was recruited once more by soon-to-be nobel laureate salvador luria to the department of biology at mit as an associate professor of microbiology huang also moved to mit to continue her research on vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) this overturned the simplified version of the central dogma of molecular biology that stated that genetic information flows unidirectionally from dna to rna to proteins this discovery made it easier to isolate and reproduce individual genes , and was heralded as evidence that molecular and virological approaches to understanding cancer would yield new cures for the dreaded disease this may have influenced president richard nixon 's war on cancer which was launched in 1971 and substantially increased research funding for the disease asilomar conference on recombinant dna baltimore also helped paul berg and maxine singer to organize the asilomar conference on recombinant dna , held in february 1975 in 1973 , he was awarded a prestigious american cancer society professor of microbiology that provided substantial salary support luria and quickly achieved pre-eminence with a remarkable group of faculty including baltimore , phillips robbins , herman eisen , philip sharp , and robert weinberg , who all went on to illustrious research careers he returned to new york city in 1975 , for a year-long sabbatical at rockefeller university working with jim darnell in 1975 , at the age of 37 , he shared the nobel prize for physiology or medicine with howard temin and renato dulbecco the infectious clone , dna encoding the genome of a virus , is a standard tool used today in virology '' jack '' whitehead , baltimore was asked to help establish a self-governed research institute dedicated to basic biomedical research they devised a unique structure of an independent research institute composed of '' members '' with a close relationship with the department of biology of mit the institute also received 5 million per year in guaranteed income and a substantial endowment in his will ( for a total gift of 135 million ) whitehead institute 's contributions to bioscience have long been second to none baltimore served as director of the wibr and expanded the faculty and research areas into key areas of research including mouse and drosophila genetics the whitehead institute has been rated as doing '' world leading research in genetics and molecular biology '' , and was an important partner in the human genome project during this time , baltimore 's own research program thrived in the new institute '' as early as 1984 , rudolf grosschedl and david weaver , postdoctoral fellows , in baltimore 's laboratory , were experimenting with the creation of transgenic mice as a model for the study of disease schatz and marjorie oettinger , as students in baltimore 's research group in 1988 and 1989 , identified the protein pair that rearranges immunoglobulin genes , the recombination-activating gene rag-1 and rag-2 daley demonstrated that a fusion protein called bcr-abl is sufficient to stimulate cell growth and cause chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) this work helped to identify a class of proteins that become hyperactive in specific types of cancer cells baltimore served as the director of the whitehead institute until july 1 , 1990 , when he was appointed the sixth president of rockefeller university in new york city he moved his research group to new york in stages and continued to make creative contributions to virology and cellular regulation their results suggest that microrna-146a protects hscs during chronic inflammation , and that its lack may contribute to blood cancers and bone marrow failure award in microbiology and immunology , 1999 national medal of science , and 2000 warren alpert foundation prize historian of science daniel kevles , writing after the exoneration of imanishi-kari , recounted the affair in his 1998 book , the baltimore case baltimore ( 1986 ) molecular cell biology , scientific american , new york , new york nobel prize video interview '' the discover magazine interview with david baltimore '' upon his retirement from the presidency of caltech in 2006 pbs interview with baltimore on aids , hepatitis , vaccines

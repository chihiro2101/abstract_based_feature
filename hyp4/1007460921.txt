nederlandse spoorwegen ( ns ) was founded in 1938 when the two largest dutch railway companies , the hollandsche ijzeren spoorweg-maatschappij ( hsm ) and the maatschappij tot exploitatie van staatsspoorwegen ( ss ) , formally merged while remaining independent companies , hsm and ss improved overall efficiency by cooperatively integrating their operations the government of the netherlands further supported hsm and ss by purchasing shares in both firms there was little alternative transport in the country besides the train , while there was a huge demand for logistics which the ns could provide while the 1950s were a good time for the company , it started to decline in the 1960s , like most other railways around the world the ns had been involved in the transport of coal from the mines in limburg to the remainder of the country this strategy meant , among other things , that the ns substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the intercity services however , it was quite clear that this would never return the company to profitability nevertheless , the company was declared to be of national importance , meaning that it would receive large amounts of subsidy every year not only were there questions regarding the way the ns spent the subsidies , but , after the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s , it was also considered not done to award generic subsidies to companies firstly , the european union passed directive 91/440 , which prescribed , among other things , the formal separation of the national railways into two separate companies , one which deals with the infrastructure , and the other which deals with the transport activities secondly , the old ceo of the ns , leo ploeger , retired , which allowed the authorities to name a new ceo which would execute the government 's plans the plans entailed that the government of the netherlands would remain responsible for the rail infrastructure , while the ns would provide the passenger transport on a commercial basis the division which was responsible for the infrastructure would later be turned into ns railinfratrust to facilitate government plans for the company 's commercial operation , den besten planned to split the ns into many smaller independent divisions the plans , however , received massive opposition from the unions , which meant that the only divisions created were ns reizigers , and locomotive maintenance company nedtrain the freight sector ns cargo became part of deutsche bahn after its merger with railion in 2000 ( later into db cargo ) db and ns sign freight merger railway gazette international 1 august 1999 these reforms were never much of a success and left the company in an uncontrollable state in 2002 karel noordzij was named as new ceo of the ns with the mission to restore the confidence in the company meanwhile , the government had changed its opinion of the railways , it no longer considered competition on ( passenger ) transport a viable goal thus , the government started to commission railway operators to run routes on the network the goal is to give individual concessions for the individual lines , but ( at least ) until 2025 the ns holds the concessions for main lines the timetable change on 10 december 2006 saw the most routes to approximate the symmetry time in clock-face schedules to the one used in most other european countries in 2013 , it was revealed that ns had been using a subsidiary in ireland , ns financial services company ( nsfsc ) , to reduce its tax liability in the netherlands from 1998 the ns used the favourable tax climate in ireland , which resulted in a profit to ns of more than €270 million but a loss to the dutch state of €21 million in 2012 alone ns used its irish subsidiary to buy new trains , among others the high-speed v250 trains from the italian firm ansaldo breda the dutch minister of finance , jeroen dijsselbloem , wrote to the parliament that ns would stop this tax evasion ns repatriates train leasing railway gazette international 26 february 2018 nsfsc was wound up in april 2019 in addition to its domestic services , ns is also a partner ( along with stena line and its british railway company abellio greater anglia ) in the dutchflyer service intercity direct is part of ns international ;

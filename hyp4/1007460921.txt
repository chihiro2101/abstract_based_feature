nederlandse spoorwegen ( ns ) was founded in 1938 when the two largest dutch railway companies , the hollandsche ijzeren spoorweg-maatschappij ( hsm ) and the maatschappij tot exploitatie van staatsspoorwegen ( ss ) , formally merged the government of the netherlands further supported hsm and ss by purchasing shares in both firms in 1938 , the authorities merged the two companies to form the nederlandse spoorwegen in the process , the government of the netherlands bought all remaining shares , yet never nationalised the company therefore , nederlandse spoorwegen remained , and still is owned by the dutch government during world war ii the ns remained an independent company , but was forced to do the germans ' bidding ; ns was forced to construct the railway lines to camp westerbork and help in the deportation of almost a hundred thousand jews to extermination camps the ns played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of the country there was little alternative transport in the country besides the train , while there was a huge demand for logistics which the ns could provide while the 1950s were a good time for the company , it started to decline in the 1960s , like most other railways around the world this strategy meant , among other things , that the ns substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the intercity services the authorities decided on the corporatization ( corporatisation ) of the ns although technically , this is not the case , but instead refers here to withdrawal of the subsidies the idea was that not only rail transport was economically viable , but that there could be competition as well the plans entailed that the government of the netherlands would remain responsible for the rail infrastructure , while the ns would provide the passenger transport on a commercial basis the idea was that these smaller divisions would be better able to respond to the market the plans , however , received massive opposition from the unions , which meant that the only divisions created were ns reizigers , and locomotive maintenance company nedtrain db and ns sign freight merger railway gazette international 1 august 1999 these reforms were never much of a success and left the company in an uncontrollable state the result was that the company started to decline rapidly , and that the employees started many unorganised strikes meanwhile , the government had changed its opinion of the railways , it no longer considered competition on ( passenger ) transport a viable goal the ns was granted ( by the national government ) the concession to run on the main lines , whereas other companies received a number of the concessions on the secondary lines the timetable change on 10 december 2006 saw the most routes to approximate the symmetry time in clock-face schedules to the one used in most other european countries in august 2015 , former minister of the interior and kingdom relations roger van boxtel was named ceo of nederlandse spoorwegen technical problems with the high-speed v250 trains , which started its services on 29 july 2012 , and ended on 17 january 2013 , led to the resignation of ceo bert meerstadt in june 2013 and to a parliamentary investigation in 2015 the high speed alliance ( hsa ) , a ns ( 90 % ) / klm ( 10 % ) joint venture almost went broke due to the late introduction of the trains in combination with a too high price for the concession which the company paid to the dutch government in 2013 , it was revealed that ns had been using a subsidiary in ireland , ns financial services company ( nsfsc ) , to reduce its tax liability in the netherlands ns used its irish subsidiary to buy new trains , among others the high-speed v250 trains from the italian firm ansaldo breda the dutch minister of finance , jeroen dijsselbloem , wrote to the parliament that ns would stop this tax evasion ns repatriates train leasing railway gazette international 26 february 2018 nsfsc was wound up in april 2019 ns ends irish-registered leasing activities railway gazette international 29 april 2019 in 2015 it became clear that a subsidiary of ns , abellio , had shown unfair behaviour with regard to a tendering for public transport in the province of limburg the company had obtained confidential information from a competitor , veolia , through a former employee of veolia who had been hired by abellio subsidiary qbuzz on 5 june 2015 , it became clear that ceo timo huges of the ns had given incomplete and incorrect information about the tendering procedure in addition to its domestic services , ns is also a partner ( along with stena line and its british railway company abellio greater anglia ) in the dutchflyer service intercity direct is part of ns international ; other services such as thalys to france and intercity-express to germany and switzerland are also part of ns international some of the most notable of these stretches are those from elst railway station to arnhem centraal railway station , where ns shares tracks with arriva , and further on to arnhem velperpoort see also intercity netherlands and list of dutch intercity stations ns has contracts with connexxion and veolia transport for the provision of bus services to replace train services in the case of planned and unplanned cancellations the increasing number of servex convenience stores at railway stations and the relatively short duration of most train journeys in the netherlands have lowered the demand for on-train services

nederlandse spoorwegen ( ns ) was founded in 1938 when the two largest dutch railway companies , the hollandsche ijzeren spoorweg-maatschappij ( hsm ) and the maatschappij tot exploitatie van staatsspoorwegen ( ss ) , formally merged as a result of world war i , the dutch economy had declined causing hsm and ss to fall from profitability while remaining independent companies , hsm and ss improved overall efficiency by cooperatively integrating their operations the government of the netherlands further supported hsm and ss by purchasing shares in both firms in 1938 , the authorities merged the two companies to form the nederlandse spoorwegen therefore , nederlandse spoorwegen remained , and still is owned by the dutch government during world war ii the ns remained an independent company , but was forced to do the germans ' bidding ; ns was forced to construct the railway lines to camp westerbork and help in the deportation of almost a hundred thousand jews to extermination camps the ns went on a strike once during the war , in the winter of 1944-45 , after it had declined to participate in one a year earlier the ns played a pivotal role in the reconstruction of the country there was little alternative transport in the country besides the train , while there was a huge demand for logistics which the ns could provide the ns had been involved in the transport of coal from the mines in limburg to the remainder of the country this strategy meant , among other things , that the ns substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the intercity services however , it was quite clear that this would never return the company to profitability in the early 1990s , the government of the netherlands started to question the subsidies given to the ns not only were there questions regarding the way the ns spent the subsidies , but , after the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s , it was also considered not done to award generic subsidies to companies the authorities decided on the corporatization ( corporatisation ) of the ns although technically , this is not the case , but instead refers here to withdrawal of the subsidies the plans entailed that the government of the netherlands would remain responsible for the rail infrastructure , while the ns would provide the passenger transport on a commercial basis the freight sector ns cargo became part of deutsche bahn after its merger with railion in 2000 ( later into db cargo ) db and ns sign freight merger railway gazette international 1 august 1999 these reforms were never much of a success and left the company in an uncontrollable state meanwhile , the government had changed its opinion of the railways , it no longer considered competition on ( passenger ) transport a viable goal thus , the government started to commission railway operators to run routes on the network technical problems with the high-speed v250 trains , which started its services on 29 july 2012 , and ended on 17 january 2013 , led to the resignation of ceo bert meerstadt in june 2013 and to a parliamentary investigation in 2015 in 2013 , it was revealed that ns had been using a subsidiary in ireland , ns financial services company ( nsfsc ) , to reduce its tax liability in the netherlands the procedure was determined to be lawful , but it was unfavorable for the dutch taxpayers for a state-owned company to avoid national taxes ns used its irish subsidiary to buy new trains , among others the high-speed v250 trains from the italian firm ansaldo breda the dutch minister of finance , jeroen dijsselbloem , wrote to the parliament that ns would stop this tax evasion on 5 june 2015 , it became clear that ceo timo huges of the ns had given incomplete and incorrect information about the tendering procedure from december 2008 train frequencies were increased on following services : arnhem–nijmegen ( 8 trains per hour ) and the hague–rotterdam ( 12 trains per hour ) , amsterdam centraal–hoofddorp ( 16 trains per hour ) in addition to its domestic services , ns is also a partner ( along with stena line and its british railway company abellio greater anglia ) in the dutchflyer service intercity direct is part of ns international ;

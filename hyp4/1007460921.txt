nederlandse spoorwegen ( ns ) was founded in 1938 when the two largest dutch railway companies , the hollandsche ijzeren spoorweg-maatschappij ( hsm ) and the maatschappij tot exploitatie van staatsspoorwegen ( ss ) , formally merged the government of the netherlands further supported hsm and ss by purchasing shares in both firms therefore , nederlandse spoorwegen remained , and still is owned by the dutch government there was little alternative transport in the country besides the train , while there was a huge demand for logistics which the ns could provide while the 1950s were a good time for the company , it started to decline in the 1960s , like most other railways around the world the ns had been involved in the transport of coal from the mines in limburg to the remainder of the country this strategy meant , among other things , that the ns substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the intercity services nevertheless , the company was declared to be of national importance , meaning that it would receive large amounts of subsidy every year not only were there questions regarding the way the ns spent the subsidies , but , after the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s , it was also considered not done to award generic subsidies to companies the authorities decided on the corporatization ( corporatisation ) of the ns although technically , this is not the case , but instead refers here to withdrawal of the subsidies secondly , the old ceo of the ns , leo ploeger , retired , which allowed the authorities to name a new ceo which would execute the government 's plans the division which was responsible for the infrastructure would later be turned into ns railinfratrust the idea was that these smaller divisions would be better able to respond to the market the route managers got de facto control over the operation , but they were dependent of a different organ in the company the freight sector ns cargo became part of deutsche bahn after its merger with railion in 2000 ( later into db cargo ) in 2002 karel noordzij was named as new ceo of the ns with the mission to restore the confidence in the company meanwhile , the government had changed its opinion of the railways , it no longer considered competition on ( passenger ) transport a viable goal thus , the government started to commission railway operators to run routes on the network the ns was granted ( by the national government ) the concession to run on the main lines , whereas other companies received a number of the concessions on the secondary lines the goal is to give individual concessions for the individual lines , but ( at least ) until 2025 the ns holds the concessions for main lines previously , this was different at minute ( 46 seconds ) and led to problems by cross-border trains technical problems with the high-speed v250 trains , which started its services on 29 july 2012 , and ended on 17 january 2013 , led to the resignation of ceo bert meerstadt in june 2013 and to a parliamentary investigation in 2015 in 2013 , it was revealed that ns had been using a subsidiary in ireland , ns financial services company ( nsfsc ) , to reduce its tax liability in the netherlands from 1998 the ns used the favourable tax climate in ireland , which resulted in a profit to ns of more than €270 million but a loss to the dutch state of €21 million in 2012 alone the corporate tax rate in ireland was 12.5 % , in the netherlands 25 % at that time ns repatriates train leasing railway gazette international 26 february 2018 nsfsc was wound up in april 2019 the company had obtained confidential information from a competitor , veolia , through a former employee of veolia who had been hired by abellio subsidiary qbuzz a night train service was added between utrecht , gouda and rotterdam intercity direct is part of ns international ; other services such as thalys to france and intercity-express to germany and switzerland are also part of ns international some of the most notable of these stretches are those from elst railway station to arnhem centraal railway station , where ns shares tracks with arriva , and further on to arnhem velperpoort see also intercity netherlands and list of dutch intercity stations the ns sneltrein services are now called intercity , but they stop more often than '' real '' intercities thus , in the case of a voluntary detour , one has to check out and check in to register starting a new journey ns stations - the result of merging the former : ns stations - in charge of the operation of all 404 railway stations in the netherlands , i.e since 1 january 2004 , tobacco smoking is prohibited on domestic trains , station halls and covered parts of platforms dutch railway services ns timetable 2010 rail transport by country rail transport in the netherlands railway stations in the netherlands train categories in europe train routes in the netherlands trains in the netherlands transport in the netherlands

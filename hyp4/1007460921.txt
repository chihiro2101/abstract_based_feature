nederlandse spoorwegen ( ns ) was founded in 1938 when the two largest dutch railway companies , the hollandsche ijzeren spoorweg-maatschappij ( hsm ) and the maatschappij tot exploitatie van staatsspoorwegen ( ss ) , formally merged in 1938 , the authorities merged the two companies to form the nederlandse spoorwegen therefore , nederlandse spoorwegen remained , and still is owned by the dutch government during world war ii the ns remained an independent company , but was forced to do the germans ' bidding ; ns was forced to construct the railway lines to camp westerbork and help in the deportation of almost a hundred thousand jews to extermination camps the ns went on a strike once during the war , in the winter of 1944-45 , after it had declined to participate in one a year earlier this strategy meant , among other things , that the ns substantially increased the number of trains per hour and also introduced the intercity services in the early 1990s , the government of the netherlands started to question the subsidies given to the ns not only were there questions regarding the way the ns spent the subsidies , but , after the neoliberal reforms of the 1980s , it was also considered not done to award generic subsidies to companies firstly , the european union passed directive 91/440 , which prescribed , among other things , the formal separation of the national railways into two separate companies , one which deals with the infrastructure , and the other which deals with the transport activities the plans entailed that the government of the netherlands would remain responsible for the rail infrastructure , while the ns would provide the passenger transport on a commercial basis to facilitate government plans for the company 's commercial operation , den besten planned to split the ns into many smaller independent divisions the plans , however , received massive opposition from the unions , which meant that the only divisions created were ns reizigers

netherlands from 1998 the ns used the favourable tax climate in ireland , which resulted in a profit to ns of more than €270 million but a loss to the dutch state of €21 million in 2012 alone the

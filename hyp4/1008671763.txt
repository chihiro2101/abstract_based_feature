at the time of montreal 's founding in 1642 most of the land stretching past mount royal to the northwest was a vast forest running the length of a long , narrow ridge known as the saint jacques escarpment in may 1912 , the décarie boulevard was officially designated , running north–south from cote-des-neiges and the town of mount royal in the north to saint-henri and cote-st-paul in the south ( a section of the road was already known as décarie avenue ) in 1908 , the first tramway made its appearance in notre-dame-de-grâce , running around the north side of mount royal from snowdon station to the intersection of mount royal and parc avenues broadly speaking notre-dame-de-grâce is a middle class first-ring residential suburb with a culturally and linguistically diverse urban population the cityscape and history of the community is rooted firmly in ndg 's role as a home for an upwardly-mobile french canadian middle class that developed much of the land roughly between confederation and the first world war ndg is a community of communities , as there are several somewhat distinct neighbourhoods within it officially the community is divided into an eastern and western ward with cavendish boulevard serving as the bisecting line the eastern part of notre-dame-de-grâce is itself split in two parts by the decarie expressway ( running north–south ) , which was built in the late 1950s and resulted in the destruction of many hundreds of homes affordable housing and proximity to major anglophone post-secondary educational institutions , particularly dawson college and concordia university , has resulted in a large and consistent student population residing in ndg ndg is almost exclusively residential and institutional in nature , defined in part by major anglophone civic institutions anchoring its eastern and western ends public schools , libraries , places of worship , parks , playgrounds , and public athletic facilities , including a local chapter of the montreal ymca , are distributed throughout the area an important housing project is situated near the geographical center of ndg on boulevard cavendish , which bisects the borough into its eastern and western halves as an example , the sliver of ndg running between the rail line and the saint-jacques escarpment ( from cavendish boulevard to the décarie expressway ) is known as st another section , separated from the rest of ndg by a highway trench and sharing a border with westmount , is closer to where the village of notre-dame-de-grâce was founded , and as such is occasionally referred to as 'old ndg ' ndg first rose to prominence as an important middle-class suburb towards the end of the 19th century , initially populated by the ( then ) new white-collar workforce of the canadian metropolis and accessible via tramways running to and from the city center concurrently , anglophone montrealers consolidated in the west end broadly speaking , with montreal 's irish and black communities shifting away from their traditional neighborhoods ( griffintown and little burgundy respectively ) and taking a more prominent position within the demographics of the area the multitude of services , including parks and other green spaces , schools , clinics , and major institutions , make it an ideal neighborhood to raise a family close to the center of the city of montreal and its central business district the area has three indoor hockey arenas : the public doug harvey arena ( formerly confederation arena ) and the private lower canada college high school and concordia university ( ed meagher arena ) rinks ndg is also served by a variety of stm bus lines offering various service levels : 10 minute max ( 6:00-21:00 ) 24 sherbrooke : east-west local bus serving decarie boulevard in ndg , villa maria metro station is its western terminus 10 minute max ( 6:00-14:00 east ) ( 14:00-21:00 west ) 90 st-jacques : east-west local bus serving st 104 cavendish : east-west local bus serving cavendish boulevard in ndg express ( day ) 420 notre-dame-de-grâce express : commuter express bus that stops along cavendish boulevard and sherbrooke before it goes to downtown montreal the décarie expressway is a major sunken urban highway that runs north–south and splits eastern ndg into two segments the administrative offices of the english montreal school board ( esmb ) , which operates anglophone public schools in this borough , are located in notre-dame-de-grâce

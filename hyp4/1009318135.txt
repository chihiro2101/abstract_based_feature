immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression ( 30.7 % vs 46.4 % ) in one study clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids , mycophenolate , and il-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab in recent years , tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , a form of inflammatory bowel disease although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc as an ointment , tacrolimus is used in the treatment of eczema , in particular atopic dermatitis an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects recently it has also been used to treat segmental vitiligo in children , especially in areas on the face lupus nephritis tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infection while also increasing renal remission in lupus nephritis the risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of treatment tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ( pimecrolimus ) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk , though the matter is still a subject of controversy interactions include that with grapefruit which increases tacrolimus plasma concentrations although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin , the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use genetic variations within cyp3a5 that result in changes to the activity of the cyp3a5 protein can affect concentrations of tacrolimus within the body a branded version of the drug is owned by astellas pharma , and is sold under the brand name prograf , given twice daily the biosynthesis of tacrolimus is hybrid synthesis of both type 1 polyketide synthases ( pks 1 ) and nonribosomal peptide synthases ( nrps ) as mentioned , if two methoxymalonyl coa molecules are substituted for two malonyl-coa molecules , they will take place in module 7 and 8 ( c13 and c15 ) , and fkba enzyme will enforce this process after these tailoring steps , the tacrolimus molecule becomes biologically active .

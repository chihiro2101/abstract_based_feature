immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression ( 30.7 % vs 46.4 % ) in one study clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation in recent years , tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , a form of inflammatory bowel disease although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects it is applied on the active lesions until they heal off , but may also be used continuously in low doses ( twice a week ) , and applied to the thinner skin over the face and eyelids lupus nephritis tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infection while also increasing renal remission in lupus nephritis occlusive dressing known or suspected malignant lesions netherton 's syndrome or similar skin diseases certain skin infections the most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments , especially if used over a wide area , include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications , with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas interactions include that with grapefruit which increases tacrolimus plasma concentrations calcineurin then dephosphorylates the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated t-cells ( nf-at ) , which moves to the nucleus of the t-cell and increases the activity of genes coding for il-2 and related cytokines although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin , the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use although short-term immunosuppression concerning patient and graft survival is found to be similar between the two drugs , tacrolimus results in a more favorable lipid profile , and this may have important long-term implications given the prognostic influence of rejection on graft survival biological half-life varies widely and seems to be higher for healthy persons ( 43 hours on average ) than for patients with liver transplants ( 12 hours ) or kidney transplants ( 16 hours ) , due to differences in clearance in 2007 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults once two malonyl-coa molecules are replaced , post-synthase tailoring steps are no longer required where two methoxymalonyl coa molecules are substituted as mentioned , if two methoxymalonyl coa molecules are substituted for two malonyl-coa molecules , they will take place in module 7 and 8 ( c13 and c15 ) , and fkba enzyme will enforce this process after the last step ( module 10 ) of pks 1 , one molecule of l -pipecolic acid formed from l -lysine and catalyzed through fkbl enzyme synthesizes with the molecule from the module 10

immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression ( 30.7 % vs 46.4 % ) in one study clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids , mycophenolate , and il-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab in recent years , tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , a form of inflammatory bowel disease although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc as an ointment , tacrolimus is used in the treatment of eczema , in particular atopic dermatitis recently it has also been used to treat segmental vitiligo in children , especially in areas on the face lupus nephritis tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infection while also increasing renal remission in lupus nephritis in people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection , an increased risk of malignancy ( cancer ) is a recognised complication the risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of treatment tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ( pimecrolimus ) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk , though the matter is still a subject of controversy tacrolimus is a macrolide calcineurin inhibitor in t-cells , activation of the t-cell receptor normally increases intracellular calcium , which acts via calmodulin to activate calcineurin although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin , the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities it is produced by a soil bacterium , streptomyces tsukubaensis tacrolimus was approved for medical use in the european union in 2002 , for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis after these tailoring steps , the tacrolimus molecule becomes biologically active .

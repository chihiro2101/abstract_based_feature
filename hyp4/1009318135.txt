immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression ( 30.7 % vs 46.4 % ) in one study clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids , mycophenolate , and il-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab in recent years , tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , a form of inflammatory bowel disease although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc as an ointment , tacrolimus is used in the treatment of eczema , in particular atopic dermatitis an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects lupus nephritis tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infection while also increasing renal remission in lupus nephritis in people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection , an increased risk of malignancy ( cancer ) is a recognised complication although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin , the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use genetic variations within cyp3a5 that result in changes to the activity of the cyp3a5 protein can affect concentrations of tacrolimus within the body across a large number of studies , individuals homozygous for the g allele have been shown to have higher concentrations of tacrolimus and require lower doses of the drug , as compared to individuals who are not homozygous for the g allele achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities there is evidence to suggest that dosing patients based on rs776746 genotype can result in faster and more frequent achievement of target tacrolimus levels tacrolimus was approved for medical use in the european union in 2002 , for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in 2009 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric , kidney , liver or heart allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults and children a branded version of the drug is owned by astellas pharma , and is sold under the brand name prograf , given twice daily after the last step ( module 10 ) of pks 1 , one molecule of l -pipecolic acid formed from l -lysine and catalyzed through fkbl enzyme synthesizes with the molecule from the module 10

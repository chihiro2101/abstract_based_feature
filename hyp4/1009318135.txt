immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression ( 30.7 % vs 46.4 % ) in one study clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids , mycophenolate , and il-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab in recent years , tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , a form of inflammatory bowel disease although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc as an ointment , tacrolimus is used in the treatment of eczema , in particular atopic dermatitis an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects lupus nephritis tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infection while also increasing renal remission in lupus nephritis in people receiving immunosuppressants to reduce transplant graft rejection , an increased risk of malignancy ( cancer ) is a recognised complication the most common adverse events associated with the use of topical tacrolimus ointments , especially if used over a wide area , include a burning or itching sensation on the initial applications , with increased sensitivity to sunlight and heat on the affected areas tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ( pimecrolimus ) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk , though the matter is still a subject of controversy the fda issued a health warning in march 2005 for the drug , based on animal models and a small number of patients in detail , tacrolimus reduces peptidylprolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin fkbp12 ( fk506 binding protein ) , creating a new complex achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities however , there is a lack of consistent evidence as to whether dosing based on rs776746 genotype results in improved clinical outcomes ( such as a decreased risk for transplant rejection or drug toxicities ) , likely because patients taking tacrolimus are subject to therapeutic drug monitoring in 2009 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult and paediatric , kidney , liver or heart allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults and children a branded version of the drug is owned by astellas pharma , and is sold under the brand name prograf , given twice daily after the last step ( module 10 ) of pks 1 , one molecule of l -pipecolic acid formed from l -lysine and catalyzed through fkbl enzyme synthesizes with the molecule from the module 10

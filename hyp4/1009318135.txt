immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with ciclosporin-based immunosuppression ( 30.7 % vs 46.4 % ) in one study clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin during the first year of liver transplantation tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids , mycophenolate , and il-2 receptor inhibitors such as basiliximab in recent years , tacrolimus has been used to suppress the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) , a form of inflammatory bowel disease although almost exclusively used in trial cases only , tacrolimus has shown to be significantly effective in the suppression of flares of uc as an ointment , tacrolimus is used in the treatment of eczema , in particular atopic dermatitis an important advantage of tacrolimus is that , unlike steroids , it does not cause skin thinning ( atrophy ) , or other steroid related side effects recently it has also been used to treat segmental vitiligo in children , especially in areas on the face lupus nephritis tacrolimus has been shown to reduce the risk of serious infection while also increasing renal remission in lupus nephritis tacrolimus and a related drug for eczema ( pimecrolimus ) were suspected of carrying a cancer risk , though the matter is still a subject of controversy the fda issued a health warning in march 2005 for the drug , based on animal models and a small number of patients however , current practice by uk dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of these new drugs tacrolimus is primarily metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system of liver enzymes , and there are many substances that interact with this system and induce or inhibit the system 's metabolic activity although this activity is similar to that of cyclosporin , the incidence of acute rejection is reduced by tacrolimus use over cyclosporin use across a large number of studies , individuals homozygous for the g allele have been shown to have higher concentrations of tacrolimus and require lower doses of the drug , as compared to individuals who are not homozygous for the g allele achieving target concentrations of tacrolimus is important â€“ if levels are too low , then there is a risk of transplant rejection , if levels are too high , there is a risk of drug toxicities in 2007 , the indications were expanded to include the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adults after these tailoring steps , the tacrolimus molecule becomes biologically active .

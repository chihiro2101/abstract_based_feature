megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods in an examination of mammal body mass changes over time , the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago ( since generation time scales with body mass 0.259 , increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes a similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared ( using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales ) terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) the largest known metatherian carnivore , proborhyaena gigantea , apparently reached 600 & nbsp ; kg , also close to this limit analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size since tetrapods ( first reptiles , later mammals ) returned to the sea in the late permian , they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range , due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs the ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids , no larger than dogs , of about 53 million years ( ma ) ago following this , the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt , and then to have backtracked , although the available fossil records are limited also , the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulation advantage of large body size in marine endotherms , although diminishing returns apply larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment the lunge feeding technique of rorquals appears to be more energy efficient than the ram feeding of balaenid whales ; the latter technique is used with less dense and patchy plankton the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in europe , both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45 & nbsp ; kg ( in contrast with other landmasses like north america and asia , which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals ) and were the largest european tetrapods in the paleocene however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early cenozoic in south america , the related phorusrhacids shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian sparassodonts during most of the cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from north america ( as part of the great american interchange ) during the pliocene however , none of the flightless birds of the cenozoic , including the predatory brontornis , possibly omnivorous dromornis or herbivorous vorombe , ever grew to masses much above 500 & nbsp ; kg , and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores , let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores it has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds south america about 500 years later , cyprus 10,000 years ago , the antilles 6,000 years ago , new caledonia and nearby islands 3,000 years ago , madagascar 2,000 years ago , new zealand 700 years ago , the mascarenes 400 years ago , and the commander islands 250 years ago humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species to adapt to the climate shift the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna , and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire the increase in fire lagged the disappearance of megafauna by about a century , and most likely resulted from accumulation of fuel once browsing stopped over the next several centuries grass increased ; sclerophyll vegetation increased with a lag of another century , and a sclerophyll forest developed after about another thousand years a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out however , the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna ; i.e in the mesozoic , it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually , contributing to the warmer climate of the time ( up to 10 & nbsp ; °c warmer than at present ) the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time , as recorded in ice cores , was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years , suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) this list is not intended to be exhaustive : clade synapsida class mammalia ( phylogenetically , a clade within therapsida ; see below ) infraclass metatheria order diprotodontia the red kangaroo ( macropus rufus ) is the largest living australian mammal and marsupial at a weight of up to the african bush elephant ( loxodonta africana ) has a shoulder height of up to and weighs up to trogontherii ) is estimated to have commonly weighed around 10 tonnes , making it possibly the largest proboscid , which would make it the second largest land mammal after indricotherines steller 's sea cow ( hydrodamalis gigas ) was probably around five times as massive , but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote commander islands in 1741 in prehistoric times this sea cow also lived along the coasts of northeastern asia and northwestern north america ; it was apparently eliminated from these more accessible locations by aboriginal hunters order pilosa ground sloths were another group of slow , terrestrial xenarthrans , related to modern sloths the extinct malagasy sloth lemur archaeoindris reached a similar size , while the extinct gigantopithecus blacki of southeast asia is believed to have been larger yet , although probably less than twice as large , contrary to early estimates ( the absence of postcranial remains makes its size difficult to judge ) some populations of archaic homo were significantly larger on average than recent homo sapiens ; for example , homo heidelbergensis in southern africa may have commonly reached in height , while neanderthals were about 30 % more massive several recently extinct north american forms were larger : the capybara neochoerus pinckneyi ( another neotropic migrant ) was about 40 % heavier on average ; the castoroides ( castoroides ohioensis ) was similar the extinct blunt-toothed giant hutia ( amblyrhiza inundata ) of several caribbean islands may have been larger still order perissodactyla tapirs are browsing animals , with a short prehensile snout and pig-like form that appears to have changed little in 20 million years the blue whale ( balaenoptera musculus ) is the largest baleen whale and the largest animal that has ever lived , at ^ j an extinct australian pliocene species of liasis , the bluff downs giant python , reached 10 m , while the paleocene titanoboa of south america reached lengths of 12–15 m and an estimated weight of about file : indricotherium11.jpg asian indricothere rhino paraceratherium was among the largest land mammals , about twice a bush elephant 's mass image : giant squid ranheim2.jpg examination of a 9 m giant squid , an abyssal giant and the second largest cephalopod

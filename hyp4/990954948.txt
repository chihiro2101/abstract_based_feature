. evolution of large body size one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods in an examination of mammal body mass changes over time , the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago ( since generation time scales with body mass 0.259 , increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes among terrestrial mammals , the fastest rates of increase of body mass 0.259 vs terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) the largest known metatherian carnivore , proborhyaena gigantea , apparently reached 600 & nbsp ; kg , also close to this limit it has also been suggested that maximum size for mammalian carnivores is constrained by the stress the humerus can withstand at top running speed analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size however , the two parameters are interrelated ( due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation ) , making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify the ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids , no larger than dogs , of about 53 million years ( ma ) ago following this , the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt , and then to have backtracked , although the available fossil records are limited fewer biomechanics constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity , and with aquatic locomotion as opposed to terrestrial locomotion among toothed whales , maximum body size appears to be limited by food availability larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment during this interval , apex predator niches were often occupied by reptiles , such as terrestrial crocodilians ( e.g this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early cenozoic in north america , the bathornithids paracrax and bathornis were apex predators but became extinct by the early miocene it has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna , and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire over the next several centuries grass increased ; sclerophyll vegetation increased with a lag of another century , and a sclerophyll forest developed after about another thousand years continuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional megafaunal extinctions in the recent past , and has created a serious danger of further extinctions in the near future ( see examples below ) a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out famously , in the cretaceousâ€“paleogene extinction event the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptilians were eliminated , many species of other types , including plants , marine invertebrates and plankton , went extinct as well thus , the earlier events must have been caused by more generalized types of disturbances to the biosphere in south america 's amazon basin , it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98 % following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago one study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the great plains of north america before contact with european settlers the study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the pleistocene epoch after the extinction of megafauna in the americas after early humans migrated to the americas about 13,000 bp , their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there this suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the younger dryas the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time , as recorded in ice cores , was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years , suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) the extinct marsupial lion ( thylacoleo carnifex ) , at up to was much larger than any extant carnivorous marsupial infraclass eutheria superorder afrotheria order proboscidea elephants are the largest living land animals the african bush elephant ( loxodonta africana ) has a shoulder height of up to and weighs up to in prehistoric times this sea cow also lived along the coasts of northeastern asia and northwestern north america ; it was apparently eliminated from these more accessible locations by aboriginal hunters superorder xenarthra order cingulata the glyptodonts were a group of large , heavily armored ankylosaur-like xenarthrans related to living armadillos order pilosa ground sloths were another group of slow , terrestrial xenarthrans , related to modern sloths they had a similar history , although they reached north america earlier , and spread farther north ( e.g several recently extinct north american forms were larger : the capybara neochoerus pinckneyi ( another neotropic migrant ) was about 40 % heavier on average ; the castoroides ( castoroides ohioensis ) was similar order siluriformes the critically endangered mekong giant catfish ( pangasianodon gigas ) , at up to , is often viewed as the largest freshwater fish class chondrichthyes order lamniformes the largest living predatory fish , the great white shark ( carcharodon carcharias ) , reaches weights up to image : giant squid ranheim2.jpg examination of a 9 m giant squid , an abyssal giant and the second largest cephalopod

megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults these characteristics , although not exclusive to such megafauna , make them vulnerable to human overexploitation , in part because of their slow population recovery rates . evolution of large body size one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods in an examination of mammal body mass changes over time , the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) the largest known metatherian carnivore , proborhyaena gigantea , apparently reached 600 & nbsp ; kg , also close to this limit a similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals , the energetic cost of obtaining prey , and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size following this , the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt , and then to have backtracked , although the available fossil records are limited however , in the period from 31 ma ago ( in the oligocene ) to the present , cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass ( a rate of increase in body mass 0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years ) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals this trend led to the largest animal of all time , the modern blue whale several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible also , the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulation advantage of large body size in marine endotherms , although diminishing returns apply among toothed whales , maximum body size appears to be limited by food availability larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment the cooling trend in earth 's recent history may have generated more localities of high plankton abundance via wind-driven upwellings , facilitating the evolution of gigantic whales the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to other large pinnipeds include the northern elephant seal at , walrus at , and steller sea lion at the sirenians are another group of marine mammals which adapted to fully aquatic life around the same time as the cetaceans did because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity ( during the paleocene ) for evolution of gigantism without much competition in north america , the bathornithids paracrax and bathornis were apex predators but became extinct by the early miocene in contrast , large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present it has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species to adapt to the climate shift during two periods of climate change about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago , sclerophyll vegetation had also increased at the site in response to a shift to cooler , drier conditions ; neither of these episodes had a significant impact on megafaunal abundance , many species of other types , including plants , marine invertebrates and plankton , went extinct as well in south america 's amazon basin , it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98 % following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago today , around 20 % of annual methane emissions come from livestock methane release in the mesozoic , it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually , contributing to the warmer climate of the time ( up to 10 & nbsp ; °c warmer than at present ) one study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the great plains of north america before contact with european settlers another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the pleistocene epoch after the extinction of megafauna in the americas the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) infraclass eutheria superorder afrotheria order proboscidea elephants are the largest living land animals among recently extinct proboscideans , mammoths ( mammuthus ) were close relatives of elephants , while mastodons ( mammut ) were much more distantly related steller 's sea cow ( hydrodamalis gigas ) was probably around five times as massive , but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote commander islands in 1741 they originated in south america , invaded north america during the great american interchange , and went extinct at the end of the pleistocene epoch order pilosa ground sloths were another group of slow , terrestrial xenarthrans , related to modern sloths they had a similar history , although they reached north america earlier , and spread farther north ( e.g some populations of archaic homo were significantly larger on average than recent homo sapiens ; for example , homo heidelbergensis in southern africa may have commonly reached in height , while neanderthals were about 30 % more massive several recently extinct north american forms were larger : the capybara neochoerus pinckneyi ( another neotropic migrant ) was about 40 % heavier on average ; the castoroides ( castoroides ohioensis ) was similar the extinct blunt-toothed giant hutia ( amblyrhiza inundata ) of several caribbean islands may have been larger still superorder laurasiatheria order carnivora the largest extant cats are in genus panthera , including the tiger ( p the largest living bird , the ostrich ( struthio camelus ) was surpassed by the extinct vorombe of madagascar , the heaviest of the group at up to , and the extinct dinornis ( dinornis ) of new zealand , the tallest , growing to heights of order squamata while the largest extant lizard , the komodo dragon ( varanus komodoensis ) , another island giant , can reach in length , its extinct australian relative megalania may have reached more than twice that size jpg hippo-sized diprotodon of australia , the largest marsupial of all time , became extinct 40,000 years ago

megafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally k-strategists , with high longevity , slow population growth rates , low mortality rates , and ( at least for the largest ) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods in an examination of mammal body mass changes over time , the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes a similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared ( using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales ) the rate for carnivorans ( 0.65 ) was slightly lower yet , while primates , perhaps constrained by their arboreal habits , had the lowest rate ( 0.39 ) among the mammalian groups studied terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) a similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals , the energetic cost of obtaining prey , and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake it has also been suggested that maximum size for mammalian carnivores is constrained by the stress the humerus can withstand at top running speed analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size however , the two parameters are interrelated ( due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation ) , making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify the ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids , no larger than dogs , of about 53 million years ( ma ) ago however , in the period from 31 ma ago ( in the oligocene ) to the present , cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass ( a rate of increase in body mass 0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years ) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals fewer biomechanics constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity , and with aquatic locomotion as opposed to terrestrial locomotion among toothed whales , maximum body size appears to be limited by food availability the lunge feeding technique of rorquals appears to be more energy efficient than the ram feeding of balaenid whales ; the latter technique is used with less dense and patchy plankton the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to these findings indicate that flightlessness and gigantism arose independently multiple times among ratites via parallel evolution predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early cenozoic however , none of the flightless birds of the cenozoic , including the predatory brontornis , possibly omnivorous dromornis or herbivorous vorombe , ever grew to masses much above 500 & nbsp ; kg , and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores , let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores south america about 500 years later , cyprus 10,000 years ago , the antilles 6,000 years ago , new caledonia and nearby islands 3,000 years ago , madagascar 2,000 years ago , new zealand 700 years ago , the mascarenes 400 years ago , and the commander islands 250 years ago nearly all of the world 's isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans , though most of these islands , such as the hawaiian islands , never had terrestrial megafauna , so their extinct fauna were smaller an analysis of the timing of holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials , periods of abrupt warming , but only when humans were also present during two periods of climate change about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago , sclerophyll vegetation had also increased at the site in response to a shift to cooler , drier conditions ; neither of these episodes had a significant impact on megafaunal abundance a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out however , the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna ; i.e in south america 's amazon basin , it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98 % following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago in the sea , cetaceans and pinnipeds that feed at depth are thought to translocate nitrogen from deep to shallow water , enhancing ocean productivity , and counteracting the activity of zooplankton , which tend to do the opposite in the mesozoic , it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually , contributing to the warmer climate of the time ( up to 10 & nbsp ; °c warmer than at present ) this large emission follows from the enormous estimated biomass of sauropods , and because methane production of individual herbivores is believed to be almost proportional to their mass recent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in atmospheric methane one study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the great plains of north america before contact with european settlers the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time , as recorded in ice cores , was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years , suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) this list is not intended to be exhaustive : clade synapsida class mammalia ( phylogenetically , a clade within therapsida ;

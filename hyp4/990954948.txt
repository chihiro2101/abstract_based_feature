these characteristics , although not exclusive to such megafauna , make them vulnerable to human overexploitation , in part because of their slow population recovery rates . evolution of large body size one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods in an examination of mammal body mass changes over time , the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change subsequent to the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about ma ( million years ) ago , terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude however , when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation , the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of indricotherium 30 ma ago ) megaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over 10,000 & nbsp ; kg a similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared ( using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales ) the rate for carnivorans ( 0.65 ) was slightly lower yet , while primates , perhaps constrained by their arboreal habits , had the lowest rate ( 0.39 ) among the mammalian groups studied terrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups ( the artiodactyl andrewsarchus - formerly considered a mesonychid , the oxyaenid sarkastodon , and the carnivorans amphicyon and arctodus ) all reached a maximum size of about 1000 & nbsp ; kg ( the carnivoran arctotherium and the hyaenodontid simbakubwa may have been somewhat larger ) the largest known metatherian carnivore , proborhyaena gigantea , apparently reached 600 & nbsp ; kg , also close to this limit a similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals , the energetic cost of obtaining prey , and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size the ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids , no larger than dogs , of about 53 million years ( ma ) ago by 40 ma ago , cetaceans had attained a length of 20 m or more in basilosaurus , an elongated , serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them however , in the period from 31 ma ago ( in the oligocene ) to the present , cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass ( a rate of increase in body mass 0.259 of a factor of 3.2 per million years ) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals this trend led to the largest animal of all time , the modern blue whale larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment compared to odontocetes , the efficiency of baleen whales ' filter feeding scales more favorably with increasing size when planktonic food is dense , making larger size more advantageous the largest carnivorans of all time are marine pinnipeds , the largest of which is the southern elephant seal , which can reach 6 meters in length and weigh up to other large pinnipeds include the northern elephant seal at , walrus at , and steller sea lion at the sirenians are another group of marine mammals which adapted to fully aquatic life around the same time as the cetaceans did the largest sirenian was the steller 's sea cow , which reached up to 10 meters in length and weighed , and was hunted to extinction in the 18th century the semi-aquatic hippopotamus , which is the terrestrial mammal most closely related to cetaceans , can reach during this interval , apex predator niches were often occupied by reptiles , such as terrestrial crocodilians ( e.g this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand similarly , the small kiwi of new zealand have been found to be the sister group of the extinct elephant birds of madagascar these findings indicate that flightlessness and gigantism arose independently multiple times among ratites via parallel evolution the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna , and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire a number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in earth 's geologic history , in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out famously , in the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptilians were eliminated in the sea , cetaceans and pinnipeds that feed at depth are thought to translocate nitrogen from deep to shallow water , enhancing ocean productivity , and counteracting the activity of zooplankton , which tend to do the opposite the study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year after early humans migrated to the americas about 13,000 bp , their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) infraclass eutheria superorder afrotheria order proboscidea elephants are the largest living land animals trogontherii ) is estimated to have commonly weighed around 10 tonnes , making it possibly the largest proboscid , which would make it the second largest land mammal after indricotherines steller 's sea cow ( hydrodamalis gigas ) was probably around five times as massive , but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote commander islands in 1741 in prehistoric times this sea cow also lived along the coasts of northeastern asia and northwestern north america ; it was apparently eliminated from these more accessible locations by aboriginal hunters they originated in south america , invaded north america during the great american interchange , and went extinct at the end of the pleistocene epoch order pilosa ground sloths were another group of slow , terrestrial xenarthrans , related to modern sloths order rodentia the extant capybara ( hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ) of south america , the largest living rodent , weighs up to order perissodactyla tapirs are browsing animals , with a short prehensile snout and pig-like form that appears to have changed little in 20 million years they are among the second-largest living land mammals at 850-3,800 & nbsp ;

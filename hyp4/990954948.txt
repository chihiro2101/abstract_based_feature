these characteristics , although not exclusive to such megafauna , make them vulnerable to human overexploitation , in part because of their slow population recovery rates . evolution of large body size one observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods this is thought to reflect the emergence , during a trend of increasing maximum body size , of a series of anatomical , physiological , environmental , genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible a strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass , such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism when normalized to generation length , the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change starting from just a few kg before the event , maximum size had reached ~50 & nbsp ; kg a few million years later , and ~750 & nbsp ; kg by the end of the paleocene this trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 ma ago ( in the late eocene ) , suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached , after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude the largest of these , indricotheres and proboscids , have been hindgut fermenters , which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes a similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared ( using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales ) among terrestrial mammals , the fastest rates of increase of body mass 0.259 vs analysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size however , the two parameters are interrelated ( due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation ) , making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify since tetrapods ( first reptiles , later mammals ) returned to the sea in the late permian , they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range , due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs the ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids , no larger than dogs , of about 53 million years ( ma ) ago following this , the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt , and then to have backtracked , although the available fossil records are limited fewer biomechanics constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity , and with aquatic locomotion as opposed to terrestrial locomotion also , the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulation advantage of large body size in marine endotherms , although diminishing returns apply larger size , as in sperm and beaked whales , facilitates deeper diving to access relatively easily-caught , large cephalopod prey in a less competitive environment compared to odontocetes , the efficiency of baleen whales ' filter feeding scales more favorably with increasing size when planktonic food is dense , making larger size more advantageous the lunge feeding technique of rorquals appears to be more energy efficient than the ram feeding of balaenid whales ; the latter technique is used with less dense and patchy plankton other large pinnipeds include the northern elephant seal at , walrus at , and steller sea lion at because of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs , nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity ( during the paleocene ) for evolution of gigantism without much competition during this interval , apex predator niches were often occupied by reptiles , such as terrestrial crocodilians ( e.g this is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the northern hemisphere , while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on gondwanan land masses and europe gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in europe , both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45 & nbsp ; kg ( in contrast with other landmasses like north america and asia , which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals ) and were the largest european tetrapods in the paleocene however , recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree , and are the sister group of the extinct moa of new zealand predatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early cenozoic later in the cenozoic , however , they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out in contrast , large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present it has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds an analysis of the timing of holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials , periods of abrupt warming , but only when humans were also present humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species to adapt to the climate shift the high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna , and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire the increase in fire lagged the disappearance of megafauna by about a century , and most likely resulted from accumulation of fuel once browsing stopped during two periods of climate change about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago , sclerophyll vegetation had also increased at the site in response to a shift to cooler , drier conditions ; neither of these episodes had a significant impact on megafaunal abundance in south america 's amazon basin , it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98 % following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago this large emission follows from the enormous estimated biomass of sauropods , and because methane production of individual herbivores is believed to be almost proportional to their mass recent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in atmospheric methane the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time , as recorded in ice cores , was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years , suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work the following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna ( in the sense of the '' large animal '' definition ) the extinct marsupial lion ( thylacoleo carnifex ) , at up to was much larger than any extant carnivorous marsupial among recently extinct proboscideans , mammoths ( mammuthus ) were close relatives of elephants , while mastodons ( mammut ) were much more distantly related steller 's sea cow ( hydrodamalis gigas ) was probably around five times as massive , but was exterminated by humans within 27 years of its discovery off the remote commander islands in 1741 order pilosa ground sloths were another group of slow , terrestrial xenarthrans , related to modern sloths some populations of archaic homo were significantly larger on average than recent homo sapiens ; for example , homo heidelbergensis in southern africa may have commonly reached in height , while neanderthals were about 30 % more massive order rodentia the extant capybara ( hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ) of south america , the largest living rodent , weighs up to several recently extinct north american forms were larger : the capybara neochoerus pinckneyi ( another neotropic migrant ) was about 40 % heavier on average ; the castoroides ( castoroides ohioensis ) was similar the southern elephant seal ( mirounga leonina ) of antarctic and subantarctic waters is the largest carnivoran of all time , with bull males reaching a maximum length of and maximum weight of an extinct australian pliocene species of liasis , the bluff downs giant python , reached 10 m , while the paleocene titanoboa of south america reached lengths of 12â€“15 m and an estimated weight of about class actinopterygii order tetraodontiformes the largest extant bony fish is the ocean sunfish ( mola mola ) , whose average adult weight is jpg hippo-sized diprotodon of australia , the largest marsupial of all time , became extinct 40,000 years ago jpg macrauchenia , south america 's last and largest litoptern , may have had a short saiga-like trunk or moose-like nostrils image : giant squid ranheim2.jpg examination of a 9 m giant squid , an abyssal giant and the second largest cephalopod

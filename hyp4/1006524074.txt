gamesmen similar to chaupar with different colour schemes along with dice have been identified from the iron age during the painted grey ware period from sites in mathura and noh ( 1100-800 bc a 6th- or 7th-century representation of lord shiva and the goddess parvati is said to be playing chaupar ( a closely related game ) murray 1913 , p 50 philologist irving finkel wrote : the game of pachisi was played by akbar in a truly regal manner it was here that akbar and his courtiers played this game ; sixteen young slaves from the harem wearing the players ' colours , represented the pieces , and moved to the squares according to the throw of the dice it is said that the emperor took such a fancy to playing the game on this grand scale that he had a court for pachisi constructed in all his palaces , and traces of such are still visible at agra and allahabad it is often assumed that the gambling game that plays so significant a role in the mahabharata , the classical literary epic , is pachisi , but the descriptions , such as they are , do not tie in with the game , and this conclusion is perhaps erroneous each player has four beehive-shaped pieces ( this can be increased to up to 16 pieces on each side in some versions ) the shells are thrown from the player 's hand and the number of cowries which fall with their openings upwards indicate how many spaces the player may move : the board is usually embroidery on cloth in some versions , each player throws the cowrie shells and pieces can not move until a 2 , 3 , or 4 is thrown if a 6 , 10 , or 25 is thrown , the player gets a grace , which enables the player to introduce one of their pieces from the charkoni onto the board a player may have any number of pieces on the board at one time also , if the player casts a value higher than they are eligible to move in a single throw , then the player automatically loses that turn if a piece lands on a square ( other than a castle square ) occupied by any number of the opponent 's pieces , those pieces are captured/killed and must return to the charkoni if the player casts a 10 , 25 , or 30 , the player needs to consecutively throw either 10 , 25 , or 30 three times ( including the original throw ) to nullify the higher value throw if the player casts a 14 , the player must consecutively cast a 14 only 3 times ( including the original throw ) to nullify the throw however , when all the player 's pieces have already been introduced onto the board , the player can then move a total of 55 squares ( 25+25+3+1+1 ) , meaning 2 pyadas extra

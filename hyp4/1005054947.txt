materials that can absorb energy and radiate it in those wavelengths exhibit a strong cooling effect materials that can also reflect 95 % or more of sunlight in the 200 nanometres to 2.5 & nbsp ; µm range can exhibit cooling even in direct sunlight the earth-atmosphere system uses radiative cooling to emit long-wave ( infrared ) radiation to balance the absorption of short-wave ( visible light ) energy from the sun radiative cooling is commonly experienced on cloudless nights , when heat is radiated into space from the surface of the earth , or from the skin of a human observer the effect is blunted by earth 's surrounding atmosphere , and particularly the water vapor it contains , so the apparent temperature of the sky is far warmer than outer space the same radiative cooling mechanism can cause frost or black ice to form on surfaces exposed to the clear night sky , even when the ambient temperature does not fall below freezing in 2014 , researchers developed the first daytime radiative cooler using a multi-layer thermal photonic structure that selectively emits long-wave infrared into space , and can achieve 5 & nbsp ; °c sub-ambient cooling under direct sunlight silvered polymer films with solar reflectances of 0.97 and thermal emittance of 0.96 , which remain 11 & nbsp ; °c cooler than commercial white paints under the mid-summer sun , were reported in 2015 high emissivity coatings that facilitate radiative cooling may be used in heat shield ( rtps ) in spacecraft and hypersonic aircraft heat shield optical solar reflector , used for thermal control of spacecraft passive cooling radiative forcing stefan-boltzmann law albedo urban heat island urban thermal plume

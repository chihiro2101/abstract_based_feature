these systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix the first system of radio navigation was the radio direction finder , or rdf kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours by rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null , the relative bearing of the station can be determined the main problem with rdf is that it required a special antenna on the vehicle , which may not be easy to mount on smaller vehicles or single-crew aircraft during the era between world war i and world war ii , a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground the first such system was the german telefunken kompass sender , which began operations in 1907 and was used operationally by the zeppelin fleet until 1918 one of the longest lasting examples was sonne , which went into operation just before world war ii and was used operationally under the name consol until 1991 the modern vor system is based on the same principles ( see below ) this also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these rdf systems , now referred to as non-directional beacons ( ndb ) the frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz , but the same system can be used with any common am-band commercial station vhf omnidirectional range , or vor , is an implementation of the reverse-rdf system , but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated this signal is rotated mechanically or electrically at 30 & nbsp ; hz , which appears as a 30 & nbsp ; hz am signal added to the previous two signals , the phasing of which is dependent on the position of the aircraft relative to the vor station conversion from this audio signal into a usable navigation aid is done by a navigation converter , which takes the reference signal and compares the phasing with the variable signal the phase difference in degrees is transmitted to flight station navigational displays for use by the flight crew once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction beam systems broadcast narrow signals in the sky , and navigation is accomplished by keeping the aircraft centred in the beam these systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive , as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies however , they did not provide navigation outside of the beams , and were thus less flexible in use the system was accurate to less than a degree in some forms development was restarted in germany in the 1930s as a short-range system deployed at airports as a blind landing aid lorenz was an early predecessor to the modern instrument landing system bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver , using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s one of these patterns was '' keyed '' with the morse code signal '' a '' , dit-dah , and the second pattern '' n '' , dah-dit this created two opposed '' a '' quadrants and two opposed '' n '' quadrants around the station the borders between these quadrants created four course legs or '' beams '' and if the pilot flew down these lines , the '' a '' and '' n '' signal merged into a steady '' on course '' tone and the pilot was '' on the beam '' if the pilot deviated to either side the '' a '' or '' n '' tone would become louder and the pilot knew to make a correction effective course accuracy was about three degrees , which near the station provided sufficient safety margins for instrument approaches down to low minimums the remaining widely used beam systems are glide path and the localizer of the instrument landing system ( ils ) ils can provide enough accuracy and redundancy to allow automated landings the introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances the received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power , and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used the same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator 's station , which is equipped with an oscilloscope by measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip , which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception , the distance to the object can be determined any radio signal spreads out over distance , forming the fan-like beams of the lorenz signal , for instance finer accuracy was then provided by measuring the phase difference of the signals , overlaying that second measure on the first radio stations and systems – article 1.42 , definition : radionavigation service – defined as « a radiodetermination service for the purpose of radionavigation , including obstruction warning

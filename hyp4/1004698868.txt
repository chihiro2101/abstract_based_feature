these systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix the first system of radio navigation was the radio direction finder , or rdf kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours at most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern , but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other , producing a sharp drop in reception known as the '' null '' a smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna , but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult during the era between world war i and world war ii , a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction by timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null , then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station , the bearing of the station could be calculated this also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these rdf systems , now referred to as non-directional beacons ( ndb ) the frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz , but the same system can be used with any common am-band commercial station this signal is rotated mechanically or electrically at 30 & nbsp ; hz , which appears as a 30 & nbsp ; hz am signal added to the previous two signals , the phasing of which is dependent on the position of the aircraft relative to the vor station in the vor signal is a single rf carrier that is demodulated into a composite audio signal composed of a 9960 & nbsp ; hz reference signal frequency modulated at 30 & nbsp ; hz , a 30 & nbsp ; hz am reference signal , and a 1020 & nbsp ; hz 'marker ' signal for station identification station identification is known by listening to the audio directly , as the 9960 & nbsp ; hz and 30 & nbsp ; hz signals are filtered out of the aircraft internal communication system , leaving only the 1020 & nbsp ; hz morse-code station identification the system is often able to be utilized with a compatible glideslope and marker beacon receiver , making the aircraft ils-capable ( instrument landing system ) once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction these systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive , as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies the rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after world war ii made systems like vor practical , and most beam systems rapidly disappeared in the post-world war i era , the lorenz company of germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center by broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams , the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones originally known as '' ultrakurzwellen-landefunkfeuer '' ( lff ) , or simply '' leitstrahl '' ( guiding beam ) , little money was available to develop a network of stations lorenz was an early predecessor to the modern instrument landing system in the immediate pre-world war ii era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver , using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s one of these patterns was '' keyed '' with the morse code signal '' a '' , dit-dah , and the second pattern '' n '' , dah-dit the beams were typically aligned with other stations to produce a set of airways , allowing an aircraft to travel from airport to airport by following a selected set of stations effective course accuracy was about three degrees , which near the station provided sufficient safety margins for instrument approaches down to low minimums at its peak deployment , there were over 400 lfr stations in the us navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared , and remained in widespread use until recently the transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal , which is sent into space through broadcast antennas when the signal reflects off a target , some of that signal is reflected back in the direction of the station , where it is received electronics attached to the oscilloscope provides a signal that increases in voltage over a short period of time , a few microseconds this '' sweep '' is triggered by a signal tapped off the broadcaster , so the sweep begins when the pulse is sent amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the y input , where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display an aircraft using gee , raf bomber command 's heavy bombers , examined the time of arrival on an oscilloscope at the navigator 's station if the signal from two stations arrived at the same time , the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters , allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations satellite navigation systems send several signals that are used to decode the satellite 's position , distance between the user satellite , and the user 's precise time radio stations and systems – article 1.42 , definition : radionavigation service – defined as « a radiodetermination service for the purpose of radionavigation , including obstruction warning

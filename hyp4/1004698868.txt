these systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix the first system of radio navigation was the radio direction finder , or rdf kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours a smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna , but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction by timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null , then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station , the bearing of the station could be calculated the first such system was the german telefunken kompass sender , which began operations in 1907 and was used operationally by the zeppelin fleet until 1918 a great advance in the rdf technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas , or a single highly directional solenoid this also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these rdf systems , now referred to as non-directional beacons ( ndb ) ndb can be categorized as long range or short range depending on their power conversion from this audio signal into a usable navigation aid is done by a navigation converter , which takes the reference signal and compares the phasing with the variable signal the phase difference in degrees is transmitted to flight station navigational displays for use by the flight crew the system is often able to be utilized with a compatible glideslope and marker beacon receiver , making the aircraft ils-capable ( instrument landing system ) once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction a number of stations are used to create an airway , with the navigator tuning in different stations along the direction of travel the rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after world war ii made systems like vor practical , and most beam systems rapidly disappeared by broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams , the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones the first widespread radio navigation network , using low and medium frequencies , was instead led by the us ( see lff , below ) lorenz was an early predecessor to the modern instrument landing system this used very large antennas to provide the required accuracy at long distances ( over england ) , and very powerful transmitters the introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances the transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal , which is sent into space through broadcast antennas the same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator 's station , which is equipped with an oscilloscope amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the y input , where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display by measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip , which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception , the distance to the object can be determined any radio signal spreads out over distance , forming the fan-like beams of the lorenz signal , for instance as the distance between the broadcaster and receiver grows , the area covered by the fan increases , decreasing the accuracy of location within it in comparison , transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals , and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else by measuring the total round-trip time on a radar 's oscilloscope , the aircraft 's range could be accurately determined even at very long ranges an operator then relayed this information to the bomber crew over voice channels , and indicated when to drop the bombs to ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations , and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator the second station was used , as in y-gerät , to time the bomb drop this was addressed in the later gee-h system by placing the transponder on the ground and broadcaster in the aircraft dme is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military tacan system , and their dme signals can be used by civilian receivers these systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals , but by comparison of a single signal with a local atomic clock one signal encodes the satellite 's ephemeris data , which is used to accurately calculate the satellite 's location at any time as a result of these advantages , satellite navigation has led to almost all previous systems falling from use the allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to article 5 of the itu radio regulations ( edition 2012 )

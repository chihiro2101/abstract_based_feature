these systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix the first system of radio navigation was the radio direction finder , or rdf kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours early rdf systems normally used a loop antenna , a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis by rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null , the relative bearing of the station can be determined during the era between world war i and world war ii , a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground one of the longest lasting examples was sonne , which went into operation just before world war ii and was used operationally under the name consol until 1991 a great advance in the rdf technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas , or a single highly directional solenoid these receivers were smaller , more accurate , and simpler to operate this also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these rdf systems , now referred to as non-directional beacons ( ndb ) ndb can be categorized as long range or short range depending on their power the frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz , but the same system can be used with any common am-band commercial station station identification is known by listening to the audio directly , as the 9960 & nbsp ; hz and 30 & nbsp ; hz signals are filtered out of the aircraft internal communication system , leaving only the 1020 & nbsp ; hz morse-code station identification once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction beam systems broadcast narrow signals in the sky , and navigation is accomplished by keeping the aircraft centred in the beam however , they did not provide navigation outside of the beams , and were thus less flexible in use the rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after world war ii made systems like vor practical , and most beam systems rapidly disappeared in the post-world war i era , the lorenz company of germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center by broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams , the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones originally known as '' ultrakurzwellen-landefunkfeuer '' ( lff ) , or simply '' leitstrahl '' ( guiding beam ) , little money was available to develop a network of stations in the immediate pre-world war ii era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver , using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs the system was highly accurate , and the 'battle of the beams ' broke out when united kingdom intelligence services attempted , and then succeeded , in rendering the system useless through electronic warfare sonne , however , proved just as useful to the uk as germany , and was left to operate unhindered throughout the war the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s this created two opposed '' a '' quadrants and two opposed '' n '' quadrants around the station navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared , and remained in widespread use until recently the same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator 's station , which is equipped with an oscilloscope electronics attached to the oscilloscope provides a signal that increases in voltage over a short period of time , a few microseconds soon after the introduction of radar , the radio transponder appeared this allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range the first distance-based navigation system was the german y-gerät blind-bombing system this used two stations in england that operated on different frequencies and allowed the aircraft to be triangulated in space the signals were then examined on existing gee display units in the aircraft ( see below ) gee used a series of transmitters sending out precisely timed signals , with the signals leaving the stations at fixed delays if the signal from two stations arrived at the same time , the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters , allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations it was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s , and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down , like gee and decca the allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to article 5 of the itu radio regulations ( edition 2012 )

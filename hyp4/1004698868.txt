these systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix the first system of radio navigation was the radio direction finder , or rdf kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours early rdf systems normally used a loop antenna , a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis during the era between world war i and world war ii , a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground as the antenna rotated through a fixed position , typically due north , the antenna was keyed with the morse code signal of the station 's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station by timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null , then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station , the bearing of the station could be calculated an improved version was introduced by the uk as the orfordness beacon in 1929 and used until the mid-1930s one of the longest lasting examples was sonne , which went into operation just before world war ii and was used operationally under the name consol until 1991 the modern vor system is based on the same principles ( see below ) combined with the introduction of the transistor and integrated circuit , rdf systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s , and were known by the new name , automatic direction finder , or adf this also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these rdf systems , now referred to as non-directional beacons ( ndb ) as the lf/mf signals used by ndbs can follow the curvature of earth , ndb has a much greater range than vor which travels only in line of sight ndb can be categorized as long range or short range depending on their power the frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750 & nbsp ; khz , but the same system can be used with any common am-band commercial station vhf omnidirectional range , or vor , is an implementation of the reverse-rdf system , but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated this signal is rotated mechanically or electrically at 30 & nbsp ; hz , which appears as a 30 & nbsp ; hz am signal added to the previous two signals , the phasing of which is dependent on the position of the aircraft relative to the vor station in the vor signal is a single rf carrier that is demodulated into a composite audio signal composed of a 9960 & nbsp ; hz reference signal frequency modulated at 30 & nbsp ; hz , a 30 & nbsp ; hz am reference signal , and a 1020 & nbsp ; hz 'marker ' signal for station identification conversion from this audio signal into a usable navigation aid is done by a navigation converter , which takes the reference signal and compares the phasing with the variable signal the phase difference in degrees is transmitted to flight station navigational displays for use by the flight crew once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction these systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive , as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies the first widespread radio navigation network , using low and medium frequencies , was instead led by the us ( see lff , below ) bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver , using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s the ground stations consisted of a set of four antennas that projected two overlapping directional figure-eight signal patterns at a 90 degree angle to each other at its peak deployment , there were over 400 lfr stations in the us the remaining widely used beam systems are glide path and the localizer of the instrument landing system ( ils ) positions can be determined with any two measures of angle or distance the introduction of radar in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances early radar systems , like the uk 's chain home , consisted of large transmitters and separate receivers the received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power , and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used in comparison , transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals , and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else dme is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military tacan system , and their dme signals can be used by civilian receivers it was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s , and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down , like gee and decca one signal encodes the satellite 's ephemeris data , which is used to accurately calculate the satellite 's location at any time radio stations and systems – article 1.42 , definition : radionavigation service – defined as « a radiodetermination service for the purpose of radionavigation , including obstruction warning the allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to article 5 of the itu radio regulations ( edition 2012 )

these systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a radio fix the first system of radio navigation was the radio direction finder , or rdf kayton , fried 1977 , p.116 by tuning in a radio station and then using a directional antenna , one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna commercial am radio stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power , but strings of low-power radio beacons were also set up specifically for this task , especially near airports and harbours early rdf systems normally used a loop antenna , a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis at most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern , but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other , producing a sharp drop in reception known as the '' null '' loop antennas can be seen on most pre-1950s aircraft and ships a smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna , but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult during the era between world war i and world war ii , a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction by timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null , then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station , the bearing of the station could be calculated a great advance in the rdf technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas , or a single highly directional solenoid combined with the introduction of the transistor and integrated circuit , rdf systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s , and were known by the new name , automatic direction finder , or adf the frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190â€“1750 & nbsp ; khz , but the same system can be used with any common am-band commercial station vhf omnidirectional range , or vor , is an implementation of the reverse-rdf system , but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated this signal is rotated mechanically or electrically at 30 & nbsp ; hz , which appears as a 30 & nbsp ; hz am signal added to the previous two signals , the phasing of which is dependent on the position of the aircraft relative to the vor station in the vor signal is a single rf carrier that is demodulated into a composite audio signal composed of a 9960 & nbsp ; hz reference signal frequency modulated at 30 & nbsp ; hz , a 30 & nbsp ; hz am reference signal , and a 1020 & nbsp ; hz 'marker ' signal for station identification conversion from this audio signal into a usable navigation aid is done by a navigation converter , which takes the reference signal and compares the phasing with the variable signal once the aircraft 's approach is accurate ( the aircraft is in the '' right place '' ) , the vor receiver will be used on a different frequency to determine if the aircraft is pointed in the '' right direction '' military aircraft will usually employ two vor receiver systems , one in vor-only mode to determine '' right place '' and another in ils mode in conjunction with a glideslope receiver to determine '' right direction the rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after world war ii made systems like vor practical , and most beam systems rapidly disappeared by broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams , the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones the first widespread radio navigation network , using low and medium frequencies , was instead led by the us ( see lff , below ) development was restarted in germany in the 1930s as a short-range system deployed at airports as a blind landing aid although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the us lff , deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate sonne system the system was highly accurate , and the 'battle of the beams ' broke out when united kingdom intelligence services attempted , and then succeeded , in rendering the system useless through electronic warfare the low-frequency radio range ( lfr , also '' four course radio range '' among other names ) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for instrument flying in the 1930s and 1940s in the u.s it was used for both en route navigation as well as instrument approaches the ground stations consisted of a set of four antennas that projected two overlapping directional figure-eight signal patterns at a 90 degree angle to each other the borders between these quadrants created four course legs or '' beams '' and if the pilot flew down these lines , the '' a '' and '' n '' signal merged into a steady '' on course '' tone and the pilot was '' on the beam '' early radar systems , like the uk 's chain home , consisted of large transmitters and separate receivers the transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal , which is sent into space through broadcast antennas the received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power , and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used the same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator 's station , which is equipped with an oscilloscope as these systems are almost always used with a specific navigational chart with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it , they generally reveal the receiver 's location directly , eliminating the need for manual triangulation the resulting system ( operating in the low frequency ( lf ) radio spectrum from 90 to 110 & nbsp ; khz ) that was both long-ranged ( for 60 & nbsp ; kw stations , up to 3400 miles ) and accurate it was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s , and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down , like gee and decca as a result of these advantages , satellite navigation has led to almost all previous systems falling from use the only other systems still in use are aviation aids , which are also being turned off for long-range navigation while new differential gps systems are being deployed to provide the local accuracy needed for blind landings

the earliest records of attacks by vikings in britain or ireland are at the end of the eighth century the monastery on lindisfarne , in the kingdom of northumbria , was sacked on 8 june 793 , and the monastery of iona in the kingdom of the picts was attacked in 795 and 802 in ireland rathlin island , off the north-east coast , was the target in 795 , and so too was st patrick 's island on the east coast in 798 portland in the kingdom of wessex in south-west britain was attacked during the reign of king beorhtric of wessex ( ruled from 786 to 802 ) 50 & ndash ; 51 ; ó corráin , '' ireland , wales , man , and the hebrides '' , pp during the second quarter of the century the frequency and size of raids increased and the first permanent viking settlements ( called longphorts in ireland ) appeared 51 & ndash ; 52 ; ó corráin , '' ireland , wales , man , and the hebrides '' , pp the ímar from whom the uí ímair were descended is generally presumed to be that ímar ( english pronunciation ivar ) : '' king of the northmen of all britain and ireland '' , whose death is reported by the annals of ulster in 873 see also woolf , pictland to alba , chapter 2 ; downham , viking kings , chapters 1 & ndash ; 3 , especially pp ó corráin , '' vikings in scotland and ireland '' , passim , sets out the case against the identification amlaíb cuarán was probably a great-grandson of ímar thus downham , viking kings , p cyril hart 's contributions to the oxford dictionary of national biography make ragnall , sitriuc and gofraid brothers ; likewise hudson , viking pirates , p downham , viking kings , pp the anglo-saxon chronicle records his marriage to king æthelstan 's sister at tamworth on 30 january 926 a daughter of sitriuc named gytha is said in the heimskringla to have married norway pirate king olaf tryggvason , but she was probably a daughter of amlaíb cuarán 171 & ndash ; 173 ; hudson , viking pirates , p following sitriuc 's death , amlaíb may have become king in york for a short time , thus keynes , '' rulers of the english '' , p but if he did it came to an end when æthelstan took over the kingdom of northumbria and defeated sitriuc 's brother gofraid downham , viking kings , p hudson , '' óláf sihtricson '' , presumes amlaíb to have been born in york , in which case he was a child at this time in 937 an attack on æthelstan 's kingdom by gofraid 's son amlaíb , assisted by constantín mac áeda , the king of alba , and owen , the king of strathclyde , ended in defeat at the battle of brunanburh 168 & ndash ; 173 ; downham , viking kings , pp hudson , viking pirates , pp amlaíb mac gofrith , ruling in dublin , crossed to britain where he was accepted as king of the northumbrians the basic argument presented is that amlaíb mac gofrith did not rule in york and the suggestion that only one amlaíb , amlaíb cuarán , was king there may explain some of the apparent anomalies in the numismatic record amlaíb cuarán 's career began in 941 , following the death of his cousin amlaíb mac gofrith , when he became co-ruler of york , sharing power with his cousin ragnall mac gofrith amlaíb and ragnall ruled in york until 944 it appears that after æthelstan 's death , not only did edmund lose control of northumbria , but that the five burghs of the mercian danelaw also pledged themselves to amlaíb mac gofrith here king edmund besieged king olaf and archbishop wulfstan in leicester , and he might have controlled them had they not escaped from the stronghold in the night it is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place , and as a result historians disagree as to whether they concern amlaíb mac gofrith or amlaíb cuarán 110 ; hudson , '' óláf sihtricson '' , associate them with amlaíb cuarán swanton , anglo-saxon chronicle , pp costambeys , '' ragnall '' ; downham , viking kings , p downham , viking kings , pp 46 , 241 & 248 ; hudson , viking pirates , pp congalach and amlaíb fought against ruaidrí ua canannáin , a rival for the high kingship who belonged to the cenél conaill , based in modern county donegal in 945 the two defeated part of ruaidrí 's army in conaille muirtheimne ( modern county louth ) and the following year amlaíb raided kilcullen in the province of leinster this defeat appears to have lost amlaíb his kingship , as the annals record that blácaire , not amlaíb , was the leader of the dublin forces in the following year the main beneficiary was the brother of amlaíb 's new wife dúnflaith , domnall ua néill , who became the next high king of ireland domnall mac congalaig was married to a daughter of amlaíb , perhaps at about this time 50 & ndash ; 51 & 242 ; hudson , '' óláf sihtricson '' ; hudson , '' domnall ua néill '' amlaíb retired to the monastery on iona where he died soon afterwards downham , viking kings , pp amlaíb cuarán ( olaf kvaran ) is referred to at least twice in the icelandic sagas , once in njal 's saga and again in saga of gunnlaugr serpent-tongue

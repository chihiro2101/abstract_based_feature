the earliest records of attacks by vikings in britain or ireland are at the end of the eighth century the monastery on lindisfarne , in the kingdom of northumbria , was sacked on 8 june 793 , and the monastery of iona in the kingdom of the picts was attacked in 795 and 802 in ireland rathlin island , off the north-east coast , was the target in 795 , and so too was st patrick 's island on the east coast in 798 portland in the kingdom of wessex in south-west britain was attacked during the reign of king beorhtric of wessex ( ruled from 786 to 802 ) 50 & ndash ; 51 ; ó corráin , '' ireland , wales , man , and the hebrides '' , pp these raids continued in a sporadic fashion throughout the first quarter of the ninth century during the second quarter of the century the frequency and size of raids increased and the first permanent viking settlements ( called longphorts in ireland ) appeared 51 & ndash ; 52 ; ó corráin , '' ireland , wales , man , and the hebrides '' , pp the ímar from whom the uí ímair were descended is generally presumed to be that ímar ( english pronunciation ivar ) : '' king of the northmen of all britain and ireland '' , whose death is reported by the annals of ulster in 873 whether this ímar is to be identified with ivar the boneless , the leader of the great heathen army , is rather less certain , although at the same time not unlikely see also woolf , pictland to alba , chapter 2 ; downham , viking kings , chapters 1 & ndash ; 3 , especially pp ó corráin , '' vikings in scotland and ireland '' , passim , sets out the case against the identification amlaíb cuarán was probably a great-grandson of ímar there is no contemporary evidence setting out the descent from ímar to his grandsons , but it may be that the grandsons of ímar recorded between 896 and 934—amlaíb cuarán 's father sitriuc ( d amlaíb 's father sitriuc first appears in the record in 917 when he seized dublin , a settlement which had probably been under the control of an irish king since the expulsion of the previous viking rulers in 902 sitriuc ruled northumbria until his death in 927 the anglo-saxon chronicle records his marriage to king æthelstan 's sister at tamworth on 30 january 926 according to some late sources , such as the chronicler john of wallingford , amlaíb was the son of sitriuc and this west saxon princess hudson , viking pirates , p a daughter of sitriuc named gytha is said in the heimskringla to have married norway pirate king olaf tryggvason , but she was probably a daughter of amlaíb cuarán hart , '' sihtric cáech '' ; '' saga of olaf tryggvason '' , chapter 32 , heimskringla , pp but if he did it came to an end when æthelstan took over the kingdom of northumbria and defeated sitriuc 's brother gofraid in 937 an attack on æthelstan 's kingdom by gofraid 's son amlaíb , assisted by constantín mac áeda , the king of alba , and owen , the king of strathclyde , ended in defeat at the battle of brunanburh william of malmesbury wrote that amlaíb was present at brunanburh and spied out the english camp the night before the battle disguised as a skald 30 & ndash ; 31 ; hudson states : '' if there is any historical basis to this story , olaf cuaran is clearly confused with his cousin he died in 941 , shortly after sacking the church of saint baldred at tyninghame , struck dead by the saint 's power according to the historia de sancto cuthberto hudson , '' óláf guthfrithson '' ; woolf , pictland to alba , p the basic argument presented is that amlaíb mac gofrith did not rule in york and the suggestion that only one amlaíb , amlaíb cuarán , was king there may explain some of the apparent anomalies in the numismatic record amlaíb cuarán 's career began in 941 , following the death of his cousin amlaíb mac gofrith , when he became co-ruler of york , sharing power with his cousin ragnall mac gofrith according to the annals of clonmacnoise , amlaíb had been in britain since 940 , having left another son of gofraid , blácaire , as ruler of dublin the dating of events in the period between the death of æthelstan and the expulsion of amlaíb and ragnall is uncertain as the various versions of the anglo-saxon chronicle are in conflict it appears that after æthelstan 's death , not only did edmund lose control of northumbria , but that the five burghs of the mercian danelaw also pledged themselves to amlaíb mac gofrith here king edmund besieged king olaf and archbishop wulfstan in leicester , and he might have controlled them had they not escaped from the stronghold in the night it is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place , and as a result historians disagree as to whether they concern amlaíb mac gofrith or amlaíb cuarán the events are associated with amlaíb mac gofrith by higham , kingdom of northumbria , p 193 ; miller , '' edmund '' ; woolf , pictland to alba , p edmund reconquered the five burghs in 942 , an event celebrated in verse by the anglo-saxon chronicle the chronicle reports the baptism of amlaíb , with king edmund becoming his godparent this need not mean that amlaíb was not already a christian , nor would such a baptism have permanently committed him to christianity , as such baptisms were often political acts asser 's life of king alfred the great the following year , 949 , by which time blacáire was dead and amlaíb 's brother ruling in dublin , the northumbrians invited amlaíb to rule in york hudson , '' domnall ua néill '' ; hudson , viking pirates , page numbers needed in 960 the annals of ulster report that cammán , son of amlaíb mac gofrith , was defeated at an unidentifiable place named dub amlaíb 's byname , cuarán , is usually translated as '' sandal '' or '' shoe '' amlaíb cuarán ( olaf kvaran ) is referred to at least twice in the icelandic sagas , once in njal 's saga and again in saga of gunnlaugr serpent-tongue

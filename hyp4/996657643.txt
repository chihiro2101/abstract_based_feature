hudson , viking pirates , p hudson , '' óláf sihtricson '' , presumes amlaíb to have been born in york , in which case he was a child at this time in 937 an attack on æthelstan 's kingdom by gofraid 's son amlaíb , assisted by constantín mac áeda , the king of alba , and owen , the king of strathclyde , ended in defeat at the battle of brunanburh 168 & ndash ;

miller , '' edmund '' ; woolf , pictland to alba , p 174 ; but that either amlaíb controlled the mercian danelaw is questioned by downham , viking kings , pp here king edmund besieged king olaf and archbishop wulfstan in leicester , and he might have controlled them had they not escaped from the stronghold in the night it is not clear when in the period between 940 and 943 these events took place , and as a result historians disagree as to whether they concern amlaíb mac gofrith or amlaíb cuarán the events are associated with amlaíb mac gofrith by higham , kingdom of northumbria , p edmund reconquered the five burghs in 942 , an event celebrated in verse by the anglo-saxon chronicle congalach and amlaíb fought against ruaidrí ua canannáin , a rival for the high kingship who belonged to the cenél conaill , based in modern county donegal in the early 960s amlaíb cuarán probably faced a challenge from the sons of his cousin amlaíb mac gofrith 50 & ndash ;

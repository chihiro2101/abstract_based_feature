after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) the british experimental gloster e.28/39 first took to the air on may 15 , 1941 , powered by sir frank whittle 's turbojet '' flight ( flightglobal.com ) , 27 october 1949 p554 the united states produced the bell xp-59a using two examples of a version of the whittle engine built by general electric , which flew on october 1 , 1942 the world 's first turbojet fighter – messerschmitt me 262 an me 262 scored the first combat victory for a jet fighter on 26 july 1944 it was the fastest conventional aircraft of the war , although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means , such as the rocket-powered messerschmitt me 163 komet the us introduced the north american b-45 tornado , their first jet bomber , into service in 1948 this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines jet ! when britain ruled the skies - bbc the series of crashes gave time for the boeing 707 to enter service in 1958 and this came to dominate the market for civilian airliners turbofan aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s , bringing far greater fuel efficiency , and this is the type of jet in widespread use today most people use the term 'jet aircraft ' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines , but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion jet-powered wingsuits exist - powered by model aircraft jet engines - but of short duration and needing to be launched at height turbojets are the second oldest type ; it has a high , usually supersonic , exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section , and so is best suited to high-speed , usually supersonic , flight jet aircraft fly considerably differently to propeller aircraft for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity coandă-1910 commercial aviation contrail jet airliner jet noise jumbo jet very light jet list of jet aircraft of world war ii

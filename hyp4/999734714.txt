after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested rené lorin , morize , harris proposed systems for creating a jet efflux rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 the first turbojet aircraft to fly was the heinkel he 178 , on august 27 , 1939 in rostock ( germany ) , england , 2009 this was largely a proof of concept , as the problem of '' creep '' ( metal fatigue caused by the high temperatures within the engine ) had not been solved , and the engine quickly burned out the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) campini began development of the motorjet in 1932 , which differed from a true turbojet , in that the air was driven through by a piston engine , instead of the exhaust gas , a much more complex solution an me 262 scored the first combat victory for a jet fighter on 26 july 1944 the me 262 had first flown on april 18 , 1941 , but mass production had not started until early 1944 with the first squadrons operational that year , too late for a decisive effect on the outcome of the world war ii the us introduced the north american b-45 tornado , their first jet bomber , into service in 1948 boac operated the first commercial jet service , from london to johannesburg , in 1952 with the de havilland comet jetliner this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines the tu-144 supersonic transport was the fastest commercial jet aircraft at mach 2.35 the fastest military jet aircraft was the sr-71 blackbird at mach 3.35 most people use the term 'jet aircraft ' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines , but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion cruise missiles are single-use unmanned jet aircraft , powered predominately by ramjets or turbojets or sometimes turbofans , but they will often have a rocket propulsion system for initial propulsion for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity coandă-1910 commercial aviation contrail jet airliner jet noise jumbo jet very light jet list of jet aircraft of world war ii

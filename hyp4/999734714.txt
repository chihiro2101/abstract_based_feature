after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 the first turbojet aircraft to fly was the heinkel he 178 , on august 27 , 1939 in rostock ( germany ) the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) campini began development of the motorjet in 1932 , which differed from a true turbojet , in that the air was driven through by a piston engine , instead of the exhaust gas , a much more complex solution the british experimental gloster e.28/39 first took to the air on may 15 , 1941 , powered by sir frank whittle 's turbojet manufactured by germany during world war ii and entering service on 19 april 1944 with erprobungskommando 262 at lechfeld just south of augsburg it was the fastest conventional aircraft of the war , although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means , such as the rocket-powered messerschmitt me 163 komet the imperial japanese navy also developed jet aircraft in 1945 , including the nakajima kikka , a modified , and slightly smaller version of the me 262 that had folding wings the us introduced the north american b-45 tornado , their first jet bomber , into service in 1948 boac operated the first commercial jet service , from london to johannesburg , in 1952 with the de havilland comet jetliner this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines turbofan aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s , bringing far greater fuel efficiency , and this is the type of jet in widespread use today most people use the term 'jet aircraft ' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines , but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion jet aircraft are usually designed using the whitcomb area rule , which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a sears-haack body for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity coandă-1910 commercial aviation contrail jet airliner jet noise jumbo jet very light jet list of jet aircraft of world war ii the official erich warsitz website ( the world 's first jet pilot ) , inclusive rare videos ( heinkel he 178 ) and audio commentaries

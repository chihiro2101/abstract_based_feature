after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested rené lorin , morize , harris proposed systems for creating a jet efflux rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 the ente had previously been flown as a glider the first turbojet aircraft to fly was the heinkel he 178 , on august 27 , 1939 in rostock ( germany ) the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) the messerschmitt me 262 was the first operational jet fighter , hecht , heinrich the world 's first turbojet fighter – messerschmitt me 262 it was the fastest conventional aircraft of the war , although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means , such as the rocket-powered messerschmitt me 163 komet by the end of 1945 , the us had introduced their first jet fighter , the lockheed p-80 shooting star into service and the uk its second fighter design , the de havilland vampire the us introduced the north american b-45 tornado , their first jet bomber , into service in 1948 jet ! when britain ruled the skies - bbc the series of crashes gave time for the boeing 707 to enter service in 1958 and this came to dominate the market for civilian airliners most people use the term 'jet aircraft ' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines , but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion jet-powered wingsuits exist - powered by model aircraft jet engines - but of short duration and needing to be launched at height jet aircraft fly considerably differently to propeller aircraft for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity coandă-1910 commercial aviation contrail jet airliner jet noise jumbo jet very light jet list of jet aircraft of world war ii lutz warsitz : the first jet pilot – the story of german test pilot erich warsitz , pen and sword books ltd

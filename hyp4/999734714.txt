after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 the next year , in 1929 , the opel rak.1 became the first purpose-built rocket aircraft to fly the turbojet was invented in the 1930s , independently by frank whittle and later hans von ohain the first turbojet aircraft to fly was the heinkel he 178 , on august 27 , 1939 in rostock ( germany ) warsitz , lutz : the first jet pilot – the story of german test pilot erich warsitz ( p it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) campini began development of the motorjet in 1932 , which differed from a true turbojet , in that the air was driven through by a piston engine , instead of the exhaust gas , a much more complex solution manufactured by germany during world war ii and entering service on 19 april 1944 with erprobungskommando 262 at lechfeld just south of augsburg an me 262 scored the first combat victory for a jet fighter on 26 july 1944 it was the fastest conventional aircraft of the war , although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means , such as the rocket-powered messerschmitt me 163 komet the imperial japanese navy also developed jet aircraft in 1945 , including the nakajima kikka , a modified , and slightly smaller version of the me 262 that had folding wings this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines jet ! when britain ruled the skies - bbc the series of crashes gave time for the boeing 707 to enter service in 1958 and this came to dominate the market for civilian airliners turbofan aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s , bringing far greater fuel efficiency , and this is the type of jet in widespread use today the fastest military jet aircraft was the sr-71 blackbird at mach 3.35 most people use the term 'jet aircraft ' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines , but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion jet aircraft are usually designed using the whitcomb area rule , which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a sears-haack body coandă-1910 commercial aviation contrail jet airliner jet noise jumbo jet very light jet list of jet aircraft of world war ii

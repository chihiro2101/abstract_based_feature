after the first instance of powered flight , a large number of jet engine designs were suggested in fact the ducted-fan engine backfired , setting the aircraft on fire before any flights were ever made , and it lacked nearly all of the features necessary for a jet engine - including a lack of fuel injection , and any concern about hot jet efflux being directed at a highly flammable fabric surface rocket-engine research was being carried out in germany and the first aircraft to fly under rocket power was the lippisch ente , in 1928 '' the internet encyclopedia of science : experimental aircraft the next year , in 1929 , the opel rak.1 became the first purpose-built rocket aircraft to fly the turbojet was invented in the 1930s , independently by frank whittle and later hans von ohain the first turbojet aircraft to fly was the heinkel he 178 , on august 27 , 1939 in rostock ( germany ) warsitz , lutz : the first jet pilot – the story of german test pilot erich warsitz ( p the first flight of a jet-propelled aircraft to come to public attention was the italian caproni campini n.1 motorjet prototype that flew on august 27 , 1940 it was the first jet aircraft recognised by the fédération aéronautique internationale ( at the time the german he 178 program was still kept secret ) campini began development of the motorjet in 1932 , which differed from a true turbojet , in that the air was driven through by a piston engine , instead of the exhaust gas , a much more complex solution '' flight ( flightglobal.com ) , 27 october 1949 p554 the united states produced the bell xp-59a using two examples of a version of the whittle engine built by general electric , which flew on october 1 , 1942 an me 262 scored the first combat victory for a jet fighter on 26 july 1944 it was the fastest conventional aircraft of the war , although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means , such as the rocket-powered messerschmitt me 163 komet the us introduced the north american b-45 tornado , their first jet bomber , into service in 1948 this highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft , was much quieter , smoother , and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines turbofan aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s , bringing far greater fuel efficiency , and this is the type of jet in widespread use today most people use the term 'jet aircraft ' to denote gas turbine based airbreathing jet engines , but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion for jet aircraft the propulsive efficiency ( essentially energy efficiency ) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as , or nearly the same as , the vehicle velocity

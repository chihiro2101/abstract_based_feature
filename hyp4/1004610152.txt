the fokker g.i was a private venture design by dutch aircraft manufacturer fokker in 1936 the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( prior to the battle of the netherlands , the g.i was actively involved in air-border patrols in order to ensure neutrality & the integrity of dutch airspace in the '' five-day war '' , the available g.i fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions , strafing advancing german infantry units , but were also used to attack junkers ju 52 with relentless attacks by the luftwaffe on dutch airfields , and overwhelming german air superiority , the g.i suffered heavy losses at the conclusion of hostilities , several g.is were captured by the germans , and utilized as heavy-fighter trainers for bf 110 crews at wiener neustadt the company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber , and was interested in the g.i wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a british climate in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) in response to this specification , french aircraft manufacturer potez developed the potez 630 rickard , j ( 19 may 2011 ) , potez 630 , the basic design was extremely close to the original specification ; that of either a 2 or 3 seat , dual-engine heavy fighter , armed with two 20 & nbsp ; mm hispano-suiza hs.404 cannons in gondolas under the fuselage and a rearward-facing machine gun for defense numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced , including day fighter , night fighter , reconnaissance , and light bomber variants while the 63 series was primarily developed for the french air force and french naval air arm , they would serve with numerous other nations , both axis and allied powers , via either pre-armistice sales by the french government , or via use of captured aircraft in french service the series saw action during the battle of france , and post-armistice within both the vichy french vichy french air force , and the free french free french air forces on 20 may 1940 , the light bomber variant , the potez 633 , took part in a ground attack against german troops near arras perhaps the most successful unit operating the potez 631 was the flottille f1c of the french naval air arm between 10–21 may 1940 , aircraft of the flottille shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat while the bréguet 690 was not selected to serve as france 's primary heavy fighter , the french air force command staff was still intrigued by the sturdy and versatile design the 691 's engines proved unreliable in testing , and the decision was made to mount new engines on the design , which was finally designated as the bréguet 693 rickard , j ( 2 october 2009 ) , breguet 691 ab2 ( assaut bombardement – biplace/ two-seat attack bomber ) , few 693s were completed before the battle of france , however , enough were completed to see some action a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role before the war the british sought both twin-engined fighters with turret-mounted and nose-mounted ( cannon ) armament perhaps in the belief that '' the bomber will always get through '' , britain lagged behind in heavy fighter development during the battle of britain , bristol blenheim bombers were fitted , as an interim measure and in utmost secrecy , with radars and ventral gun packs , turning them into the raf 's first night fighters buttler , t and griffith , a american secret projects : fighters bombers and attack aircraft 1937 to 1945 p 73-74 another bomber destroyer was the beech model 28 with a 75 & nbsp ; mm gun and twin turrets for defence however , additional issues were again discovered with the pe-3bis , and in may 1942 the petlyakov design bureau switched production over to a pe-3bis with further minor modifications ; no name or designation change was made bomber destroyer interceptor aircraft light fighter night fighter

the fokker g.i was a private venture design by dutch aircraft manufacturer fokker in 1936 the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( 31 in ) madsen machine guns ( later up-armed to eight machine guns ) in the nose for defensive purposes , a single madsen 7.9 & nbsp ; mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret , manned by the second crew-member in the '' five-day war '' , the available g.i fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions , strafing advancing german infantry units , but were also used to attack junkers ju 52 with relentless attacks by the luftwaffe on dutch airfields , and overwhelming german air superiority , the g.i suffered heavy losses in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) the specification also required , at minimum , two forward-facing 20 & nbsp ; mm cannons , as well as a rearward-facing machine gun for defensive purposes numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced , including day fighter , night fighter , reconnaissance , and light bomber variants on 20 may 1940 , the light bomber variant , the potez 633 , took part in a ground attack against german troops near arras perhaps the most successful unit operating the potez 631 was the flottille f1c of the french naval air arm between 10–21 may 1940 , aircraft of the flottille shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat the reconnaissance variants , the potez 637 and 63.11 , equipped numerous groupes de reconnaissance of the french air force , with more than 700 reconnaissance potez 63.11s having been delivered in addition to the potez 63 series , another aircraft was developed from the original 1934 heavy fighter specification rickard , j ( 2 october 2009 ) , bréguet 690 , by 1938 , with france falling behind in ground-attack/close-air support aircraft , the decision was made by the air force to re-designate the bréguet 690 as the bréguet 691 , and to utilize it as a ground-attack aircraft a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters while lighter fighters were intended for defense , the destroyers were intended for offensive missions : to escort bombers on missions at long range , then use its superior speed to outrun defending fighters that would be capable of outmaneuvering it aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role due to their relatively large size , these were mostly used as night fighter-bomber destroyers , as there was ample room to install airborne intercept radar systems as well as heavy armament following the example set by the bf 110 , the japanese built the broadly similar kawasaki ki-45 toryu due to the different requirements for naval fighter aircraft , the british put into service some heavyweight single-engine fighters such as the fairey firefly buttler , t and griffith , a american secret projects : fighters bombers and attack aircraft 1937 to 1945 p 73-74 another bomber destroyer was the beech model 28 with a 75 & nbsp ; mm gun and twin turrets for defence as an escort fighter , the p-38 accompanied b-17 flying fortress raids deep into german-held europe although grumman designed and developed the aircraft during world war ii , it entered service too late to see action before vj day during the interwar period the ussr , as with many other nations , set about developing twin-engine fighters with recoilless rifle armament to function in the heavy-fighter role , particularly as interceptors and bomber destroyers 4th-generation and 5th-generation air superiority fighters are designed to wrest air superiority from the enemy in hostile territory , and thus usually have greater range than tactical fighters or interceptors bomber destroyer interceptor aircraft light fighter night fighter

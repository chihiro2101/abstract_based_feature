the fokker g.i was a private venture design by dutch aircraft manufacturer fokker in 1936 the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( for defensive purposes , a single madsen 7.9 & nbsp ; mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret , manned by the second crew-member prior to the battle of the netherlands , the g.i was actively involved in air-border patrols in order to ensure neutrality & the integrity of dutch airspace on 10 may 1940 , when nazi germany invaded , 23 g.i aircraft were serviceable in the '' five-day war '' , the available g.i fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions , strafing advancing german infantry units , but were also used to attack junkers ju 52 although reports are fragmentary and inaccurate as to the results , g.i fighters were employed over rotterdam and the hague , contributing to the loss of 167 ju 52s , scoring up to 14 confirmed aerial kills with relentless attacks by the luftwaffe on dutch airfields , and overwhelming german air superiority , the g.i suffered heavy losses the company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber , and was interested in the g.i wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a british climate in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) the specification also required , at minimum , two forward-facing 20 & nbsp ; mm cannons , as well as a rearward-facing machine gun for defensive purposes in response to this specification , french aircraft manufacturer potez developed the potez 630 numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced , including day fighter , night fighter , reconnaissance , and light bomber variants in french service the series saw action during the battle of france , and post-armistice within both the vichy french vichy french air force , and the free french free french air forces on 20 may 1940 , the light bomber variant , the potez 633 , took part in a ground attack against german troops near arras the reconnaissance variants , the potez 637 and 63.11 , equipped numerous groupes de reconnaissance of the french air force , with more than 700 reconnaissance potez 63.11s having been delivered in addition to the potez 63 series , another aircraft was developed from the original 1934 heavy fighter specification while the bréguet 690 was not selected to serve as france 's primary heavy fighter , the french air force command staff was still intrigued by the sturdy and versatile design the 691 's engines proved unreliable in testing , and the decision was made to mount new engines on the design , which was finally designated as the bréguet 693 a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters many of the best pilots were assigned to bf 110 wings , specifically designated as zerstörergeschwader ( '' destroyer squadron '' ) wings aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role due to their relatively large size , these were mostly used as night fighter-bomber destroyers , as there was ample room to install airborne intercept radar systems as well as heavy armament buttler and griffith , p144 the us military never designated an aircraft as a '' heavy fighter , '' but some american fighters were relatively heavy in weight it was designed as a twin-engine bomber interceptor to climb quickly and carry heavy armament at high speed , with the lighter bell p-39 airacobra meeting the single-engine version of the same requirement like other military types , piston-engine heavy fighters such as the de havilland hornet and sea hornet , as well as the north american f-82 twin mustang continued in service in the years immediately after the war bomber destroyer interceptor aircraft light fighter night fighter

the fokker g.i was a private venture design by dutch aircraft manufacturer fokker in 1936 the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( for defensive purposes , a single madsen 7.9 & nbsp ; mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret , manned by the second crew-member in the '' five-day war '' , the available g.i fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions , strafing advancing german infantry units , but were also used to attack junkers ju 52 with relentless attacks by the luftwaffe on dutch airfields , and overwhelming german air superiority , the g.i suffered heavy losses piet vos , managed to fly a g.i to england from the occupied netherlands after landing in england , the g.i was conscripted by miles aircraft the company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber , and was interested in the g.i wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a british climate in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) the specification also required , at minimum , two forward-facing 20 & nbsp ; mm cannons , as well as a rearward-facing machine gun for defensive purposes this was relatively heavy armament for a fighter in 1934 numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced , including day fighter , night fighter , reconnaissance , and light bomber variants the day/night fighter variant , the potez 631 , had quickly proved to be an ineffectual interceptor ; it was slower than some german bomber aircraft and 130 & nbsp ; km/h slower than the messerschmitt bf 109 e-variant fighter between 10–21 may 1940 , aircraft of the flottille shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat in addition to the potez 63 series , another aircraft was developed from the original 1934 heavy fighter specification this was the bréguet 693 , designed and manufactured originally by bréguet aviation while the bréguet 690 was not selected to serve as france 's primary heavy fighter , the french air force command staff was still intrigued by the sturdy and versatile design as the fighting drew to a close the french attempted to fly as many 693s as possible to north africa , but only three made the flight , and none were used by the vichy air force in north africa a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters many of the best pilots were assigned to bf 110 wings , specifically designated as zerstörergeschwader ( '' destroyer squadron '' ) wings it served well against the hawker hurricane during the battle of france , but was easily outperformed by – and up to 50 & nbsp ; km/h ( 31 & nbsp ; mph ) slower in top speed than – the supermarine spitfire during the battle of britain aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role due to their relatively large size , these were mostly used as night fighter-bomber destroyers , as there was ample room to install airborne intercept radar systems as well as heavy armament the p-38 proved adaptable to undertake multiple roles including fighter escort , reconnaissance ( as the f-4 and f-5 variants of which over 1,200 were built ) , and fighter-bomber as an escort fighter , the p-38 accompanied b-17 flying fortress raids deep into german-held europe like other military types , piston-engine heavy fighters such as the de havilland hornet and sea hornet , as well as the north american f-82 twin mustang continued in service in the years immediately after the war bomber destroyer interceptor aircraft light fighter night fighter

the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( for defensive purposes , a single madsen 7.9 & nbsp ; mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret , manned by the second crew-member on 10 may 1940 , when nazi germany invaded , 23 g.i aircraft were serviceable in the '' five-day war '' , the available g.i fighters were mainly deployed in ground attack missions , strafing advancing german infantry units , but were also used to attack junkers ju 52 although reports are fragmentary and inaccurate as to the results , g.i fighters were employed over rotterdam and the hague , contributing to the loss of 167 ju 52s , scoring up to 14 confirmed aerial kills with relentless attacks by the luftwaffe on dutch airfields , and overwhelming german air superiority , the g.i suffered heavy losses there are no surviving g.is today , although a replica has been built , and is now displayed at the dutch nationaal militair museum ( national military museum ) in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) the specification also required , at minimum , two forward-facing 20 & nbsp ; mm cannons , as well as a rearward-facing machine gun for defensive purposes this was relatively heavy armament for a fighter in 1934 numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced , including day fighter , night fighter , reconnaissance , and light bomber variants while the 63 series was primarily developed for the french air force and french naval air arm , they would serve with numerous other nations , both axis and allied powers , via either pre-armistice sales by the french government , or via use of captured aircraft between 10–21 may 1940 , aircraft of the flottille shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat in addition to the potez 63 series , another aircraft was developed from the original 1934 heavy fighter specification the 691 's engines proved unreliable in testing , and the decision was made to mount new engines on the design , which was finally designated as the bréguet 693 rickard , j ( 2 october 2009 ) , breguet 693 ab2 ( assaut bombardement – biplace/ two-seat attack bomber ) , a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters many of the best pilots were assigned to bf 110 wings , specifically designated as zerstörergeschwader ( '' destroyer squadron '' ) wings it served well against the hawker hurricane during the battle of france , but was easily outperformed by – and up to 50 & nbsp ; km/h ( 31 & nbsp ; mph ) slower in top speed than – the supermarine spitfire during the battle of britain aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role due to their relatively large size , these were mostly used as night fighter-bomber destroyers , as there was ample room to install airborne intercept radar systems as well as heavy armament perhaps in the belief that '' the bomber will always get through '' , britain lagged behind in heavy fighter development a contemporary design the six cannon armed vickers type 432 , which itself descended from a requirement for a fighter with 40mm cannon , got no further than the prototype buttler , t and griffith , a american secret projects : fighters bombers and attack aircraft 1937 to 1945 p 73-74 another bomber destroyer was the beech model 28 with a 75 & nbsp ; mm gun and twin turrets for defence the p-38 and the much lighter north american p-51 mustang were the first two american fighters over berlin in march 1944 4th-generation and 5th-generation air superiority fighters are designed to wrest air superiority from the enemy in hostile territory , and thus usually have greater range than tactical fighters or interceptors bomber destroyer interceptor aircraft light fighter night fighter

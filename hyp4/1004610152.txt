the fokker g.i was a private venture design by dutch aircraft manufacturer fokker in 1936 the g.i was designed to serve on the heavier end of the spectrum of heavy fighters , as a jachtkruiser or a bomber destroyer , and was comparable to early models of the german messerschmitt bf 110 the g.i was formidably armed relative even to other early heavy fighters ; with twin 23 & nbsp ; mm ( for defensive purposes , a single madsen 7.9 & nbsp ; mm machine gun was mounted in a rear-facing turret , manned by the second crew-member although reports are fragmentary and inaccurate as to the results , g.i fighters were employed over rotterdam and the hague , contributing to the loss of 167 ju 52s , scoring up to 14 confirmed aerial kills with relentless attacks by the luftwaffe on dutch airfields , and overwhelming german air superiority , the g.i suffered heavy losses at the conclusion of hostilities , several g.is were captured by the germans , and utilized as heavy-fighter trainers for bf 110 crews at wiener neustadt for the next two years , flugzeugführerschule ( b ) 8 flew the g.i until attrition grounded the fleet on 5 may 1941 , a fokker test pilot , hidde leegstra , accompanied by engineer ( and member of the fokker board of directors ) dr the company had designed an all-wooden fighter-bomber , and was interested in the g.i wing structure and its resistance to the rigours of a british climate there are no surviving g.is today , although a replica has been built , and is now displayed at the dutch nationaal militair museum ( national military museum ) in 1934 , the french ministry of air issued a specification for a new two or three-seat multi-role fighter , capable of functioning as a bomber escort and night fighter , as well as providing fighter direction ( leading formations of single-engine fighters to their targets ) the specification also required , at minimum , two forward-facing 20 & nbsp ; mm cannons , as well as a rearward-facing machine gun for defensive purposes this was relatively heavy armament for a fighter in 1934 numerous variants and sub-variants of the 63 series would be designed and produced , including day fighter , night fighter , reconnaissance , and light bomber variants in french service the series saw action during the battle of france , and post-armistice within both the vichy french vichy french air force , and the free french free french air forces on 20 may 1940 , the light bomber variant , the potez 633 , took part in a ground attack against german troops near arras the day/night fighter variant , the potez 631 , had quickly proved to be an ineffectual interceptor ; it was slower than some german bomber aircraft and 130 & nbsp ; km/h slower than the messerschmitt bf 109 e-variant fighter between 10–21 may 1940 , aircraft of the flottille shot down 12 enemy aircraft in exchange for 8 of their own losses prior to its withdrawal from active combat in addition to the potez 63 series , another aircraft was developed from the original 1934 heavy fighter specification while the bréguet 690 was not selected to serve as france 's primary heavy fighter , the french air force command staff was still intrigued by the sturdy and versatile design the 691 's engines proved unreliable in testing , and the decision was made to mount new engines on the design , which was finally designated as the bréguet 693 a major heavy fighter design was the messerschmitt bf 110 , a german fighter that , prior to the war , was considered by the german luftwaffe more important than their single-engine fighters aside from the bf 110 and me 210/410 , the luftwaffe also utilized various light bombers , medium bombers , and schnellbombers ( german ; literally '' fast bomber '' ) in the heavy fighter role buttler and griffith , p144 the us military never designated an aircraft as a '' heavy fighter , '' but some american fighters were relatively heavy in weight during the interwar period the ussr , as with many other nations , set about developing twin-engine fighters with recoilless rifle armament to function in the heavy-fighter role , particularly as interceptors and bomber destroyers with the operation barbarossa in 1941 , the soviet air forces were caught off-guard ; with only lighter , single-engined , relatively lightly-armed fighters to intercept luftwaffe bombers , and no dedicated night fighters ( a role typically filled by heavy fighters ) bomber destroyer interceptor aircraft light fighter night fighter

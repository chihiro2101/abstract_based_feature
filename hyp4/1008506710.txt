489 , 497 before the romans arrived in britain , the land now forming the county of carmarthenshire was part of the kingdom of the demetae who gave their name to the county of dyfed ; it contained one of their chief settlements , moridunum , now known as carmarthen the romans established two forts in south wales , one at caerwent to control the southeast of the country , and one at carmarthen to control the southwest the fort at carmarthen dates from around 75 ad , and there is a roman amphitheatre nearby , so this probably makes carmarthen the oldest continually occupied town in wales carmarthenshire has its early roots in the region formerly known as ystrad tywi ( '' vale of the river tywi '' ) and part of the kingdom of deheubarth during the high middle ages , with the court at dinefwr following the conquest of wales by edward i , the region was reorganized by the statute of rhuddlan in 1284 into carmarthenshire edward i made carmarthen the capital of this new county , establishing his courts of chancery and his exchequer there , and holding the court of great sessions in wales in the town the normans transformed carmarthen into an international trading port , the only staple port in wales the first industrial canal in wales was built in 1768 to convey coal from the gwendraeth valley to the coast , and the following year , the earliest tramroad bridge was on the tramroad built alongside the canal the landscape changed as much woodland was cleared to make way for more food production , and mills , power stations , mines and factories sprang up between llanelli and pembrey carmarthenshire was at the centre of the rebecca riots around 1840 , when local farmers and agricultural workers dressed as women and rebelled against higher taxes and tolls on 1 april 1974 , under the local government act 1972 , carmarthenshire joined cardiganshire and pembrokeshire in the new county of dyfed ; carmarthenshire was divided into three districts : carmarthen , llanelli and dinefwr the black mountain range dominates the east of the county , with the lower foothills of the cambrian mountains to the north across the valley of the river towy carmarthenshire is the largest historic county by area in wales the county is drained by several important rivers which flow southwards into the bristol channel , especially the river towy , and its several tributaries , such as the river cothi the river teifi forms much of the border between carmarthenshire and ceredigion , and there are a number of towns in the teifi valley which have communities living on either side of the river and hence in different counties the coastline includes notable beaches such as pendine sands and cefn sidan sands , and large areas of foreshore are uncovered at low tide along the loughor and towy estuaries the principal towns in the county are ammanford , burry port , carmarthen , kidwelly , llanelli , llandeilo , newcastle emlyn , llandovery , st clears , and whitland carmarthenshire is predominantly an agricultural county , with only the southeastern area having any significant amount of industry the lowest bridge over the river is at carmarthen , and the towi estuary cuts the southwesterly part of the county , including llansteffan and laugharne , off from the more urban southeastern region under the local government ( wales ) act 1994 , dyfed was abolished on 1 april 1996 and carmarthenshire was re-established as a county population levels have thus dipped and then increased again over the course of eighty years carmarthenshire was the most populous of the five historic counties of wales to remain majority welsh-speaking throughout the 20th century there are large stretches of golden sands and the wales coast path now provides a continuous walking route around the whole of wales west wales raiders , based in llanelli , represent the county in rugby league carmarthenshire is served by the main line railway service operated by transport for wales rail which links london paddington , and to southwest wales

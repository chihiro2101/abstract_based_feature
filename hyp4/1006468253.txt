gerhard friedrich müller developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the second kamchatka expedition ( 1733–43 ) as a professor of history and geography this became known as '' ethnography , '' following the introduction of the greek neologism ethnographia by johann friedrich schöpperlin and the german variant by a , 2008 , early history of ethnography and ethnology in the german enlightenment , leiden , p digital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography this type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies traditional ethnography may use videos or images , but digital ethnography goes more in-depth for example , digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as twitter or blogs so that people 's interactions and behaviors can be studied a modern example of this technology in application , is the use of captured audio in smart devices , transcribed to issue targeted adverts ( often reconciled vs other metadata , or product development data for designers most ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved relational ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people in this regard , the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions ( 2018 ) understanding ethnography : an 'exotic ' ethnographer 's perspective interaction design : beyond human-computer interaction ( 4th edition ) ethnography can also be used in other methodological frameworks , for instance , an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation according to john brewer , a leading social scientist , data collection methods are meant to capture the '' social meanings and ordinary activities '' brewer , john d '' the goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data in the 21st century , anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed reflexivity refers to the researcher 's aim '' to explore the ways in which the researcher 's involvement with a particular study influences , acts upon and informs such research '' social constructionist psychology : a critical analysis of theory and practice these informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community , often using snowball or chain sampling this process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied ( 2010 ) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective , in which behavior is observed , to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects research can range from an objectivist account of fixed , observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing '' the interplay of individual agency and social structure ) , encyclopedia of case study research an image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual 's perspective , primarily based on that individual 's past experiences one example of an image is how an individual views a novel after completing it cultural and social anthropology cultural anthropology and social anthropology were developed around ethnographic research and their canonical texts , which are mostly ethnographies : e.g cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common ethnographers study and interpret culture , its universalities , and its variations through the ethnographic study based on fieldwork an ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture , society , or community all being people she wished to study for her anthropological data the experience set the idea for her to produce her theory of '' culture is personality writ large '' ( modell , 1988 ) by studying the culture between the different pueblo and plain indians , she discovered the culture isomorphism that would be considered her personalized unique approach to the study of anthropology using ethnographic techniques kinship and social structure ( including age grading , peer groups , gender , voluntary associations , clans , moieties , and so forth , if they exist ) are typically included languages spoken , dialects , and the history of language change are another group of standard topics as ethnography developed , anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture , such as values , worldview and what clifford geertz termed the '' ethos '' of the culture in this way , cultural boundaries of communication could be explored , as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence geertz , while still following something of a traditional ethnographic outline , moved outside that outline to talk about '' webs '' instead of '' outlines '' geertz , clifford 190-191 along with the development of experimental forms such as 'dialogic anthropology , ' 'narrative ethnography , ' and 'literary ethnography ' , literary ethnography writing culture helped to encourage the development of 'collaborative ethnography gubrium 's series of organizational ethnographies focused on the everyday practices of illness , care , and recovery are notable but even though many sub-fields and theoretical perspectives within sociology use ethnographic methods , ethnography is not the sine qua non of the discipline , as it is in cultural anthropology like anthropology scholars , communication scholars often immerse themselves , and participate in and/or directly observe the particular social group being studied '' american anthropology association code of ethics , p.5-6 research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people these relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography , although they may influence the research findings

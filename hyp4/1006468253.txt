gerhard friedrich müller developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the second kamchatka expedition ( 1733–43 ) as a professor of history and geography this became known as '' ethnography , '' following the introduction of the greek neologism ethnographia by johann friedrich schöpperlin and the german variant by a august ludwig von schlözer and christoph wilhelm jacob gatterer of the university of göttingen introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history digital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography this type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies traditional ethnography may use videos or images , but digital ethnography goes more in-depth for example , digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as twitter or blogs so that people 's interactions and behaviors can be studied most ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved relational ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people features of ethnographic research according to dewan ( 2018 ) , the researcher is not looking for generalizing the findings ; rather , they are considering it in reference to the context of the situation in this regard , the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions ( eds ) asian qualitative research in tourism in ethnography , the researcher gathers what is available , what is normal , what it is that people do , what they say , and how they work interaction design : beyond human-computer interaction ( 4th edition ) '' the goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community interviews are often taped and later transcribed , allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking , but with all information available later for full analysis secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic in the past , kinship charts were commonly used to '' discover logical patterns and social structure in non-western societies '' in order to make the data collection and interpretation transparent , researchers creating ethnographies often attempt to be '' reflexive '' traditionally , the ethnographer focuses attention on a community , selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well critical theory researchers address '' issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power an image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual 's perspective , primarily based on that individual 's past experiences '' the idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner the image presents the perspective , experiences , and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence , the individual will always contain this image in the group under study the ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines , primarily by anthropologists/ethnologists but also occasionally by sociologists cultural and social anthropology evans-pritchard , naven ( 1936 , 1958 ) by gregory bateson , or '' the lele of the kasai '' ( 1963 ) by mary douglas the typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people , almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends ethnographies are also sometimes called '' case studies shadowed lives : undocumented workers in american society ( case studies in cultural anthropology ) the fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society , living with the local people and learning about their ways of life by studying the culture between the different pueblo and plain indians , she discovered the culture isomorphism that would be considered her personalized unique approach to the study of anthropology using ethnographic techniques folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences , chapters 7 and 8 rites , rituals , and other evidence of religion have long been an interest and are sometimes central to ethnographies , especially when conducted in public where visiting anthropologists can see them as ethnography developed , anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture , such as values , worldview and what clifford geertz termed the '' ethos '' of the culture in his fieldwork , geertz used elements of a phenomenological approach , tracing not just the doings of people , but the cultural elements themselves in this way , cultural boundaries of communication could be explored , as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence later '' reflexive '' ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer in the 1980s , the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline , under the general influence of literary theory and postcolonial/post-structuralist thought fischer and mehdi abedi , a space on the side of the road by kathleen stewart , and advocacy after bhopal by kim fortun beyond writing culture : current intersections of epistemologies and representational practices ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain '' how '' ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities while there is no international standard on ethnographic ethics , many western anthropologists look to the american anthropological association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work '' the kindly ethnographer '' – most ethnographers present themselves as being more sympathetic than they are , which aids in the research process , but is also deceptive 270-77 '' the honest ethnographer '' – if research participants know the research goals , their responses will likely be skewed

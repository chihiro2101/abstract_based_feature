gerhard friedrich müller developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the second kamchatka expedition ( 1733–43 ) as a professor of history and geography this became known as '' ethnography , '' following the introduction of the greek neologism ethnographia by johann friedrich schöpperlin and the german variant by a august ludwig von schlözer and christoph wilhelm jacob gatterer of the university of göttingen introduced the term into the academic discourse in an attempt to reform the contemporary understanding of world history , 2008 , early history of ethnography and ethnology in the german enlightenment , leiden , p digital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography this type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies traditional ethnography may use videos or images , but digital ethnography goes more in-depth most ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved relational ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people meaning that relational ethnography does n't take an object nor a bounded group that is defined by its members shared social features nor a specific location that is delimited by the boundaries of a particular area but rather the processes involving configurations of relations among different agents or institutions ( 2018 ) understanding ethnography : an 'exotic ' ethnographer 's perspective in ethnography , the researcher gathers what is available , what is normal , what it is that people do , what they say , and how they work '' the goal is to collect data in such a way that the researcher imposes a minimal amount of personal bias in the data in the past , kinship charts were commonly used to '' discover logical patterns and social structure in non-western societies '' in the 21st century , anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed reflexivity refers to the researcher 's aim '' to explore the ways in which the researcher 's involvement with a particular study influences , acts upon and informs such research '' traditionally , the ethnographer focuses attention on a community , selecting knowledgeable informants who know the activities of the community well these informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community , often using snowball or chain sampling this process is often effective in revealing common cultural denominators connected to the topic being studied participation , rather than just observation , is one of the keys to this process ethnography is very useful in social research ( 2010 ) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography ethnographic research can range from a realist perspective , in which behavior is observed , to a constructivist perspective where understanding is socially constructed by the researcher and subjects ) , encyclopedia of case study research critical theory researchers address '' issues of power within the researcher-researched relationships and the links between knowledge and power '' the image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea '' the idea of an image relies on the imagination and has been seen to be utilized by children in a very spontaneous and natural manner the image presents the perspective , experiences , and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence , the individual will always contain this image in the group under study the ethnographic method is used across a range of different disciplines , primarily by anthropologists/ethnologists but also occasionally by sociologists cultural anthropology and social anthropology were developed around ethnographic research and their canonical texts , which are mostly ethnographies : e.g cultural and social anthropologists today place a high value on doing ethnographic research the typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people , almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends the fieldwork usually involves spending a year or more in another society , living with the local people and learning about their ways of life the experience set the idea for her to produce her theory of '' culture is personality writ large '' ( modell , 1988 ) folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences material culture , technology , and means of subsistence are usually treated next , as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure practices of child rearing , acculturation , and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure for example , if within a group of people , winking was a communicative gesture , he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean ( it might mean several things ) in this way , cultural boundaries of communication could be explored , as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence within cultural anthropology , there are several subgenres of ethnography beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s , anthropologists began writing '' bio-confessional '' ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research in the 1980s , the rhetoric of ethnography was subjected to intense scrutiny within the discipline , under the general influence of literary theory and postcolonial/post-structuralist thought beyond writing culture : current intersections of epistemologies and representational practices while there is no international standard on ethnographic ethics , many western anthropologists look to the american anthropological association for guidance when conducting ethnographic work '' american anthropology association code of ethics , p.5-6 research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people these relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography , although they may influence the research findings

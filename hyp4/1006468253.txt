ethnology in the german enlightenment , leiden , p digital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography this type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil digital ethnography allows for a lot more opportunities to look at different cultures and societies traditional ethnography may use videos or images , but digital ethnography goes more in-depth for example , digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as twitter or blogs so that people 's interactions and behaviors can be studied most ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved relational ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people meaning that relational ethnography does n't take an object nor a bounded group that is defined by its members shared social features nor a specific location that is delimited by the boundaries of a particular area features of ethnographic research in this regard , the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions ( eds ) asian qualitative research in tourism in ethnography , the researcher gathers what is available , what is normal , what it is that people do , what they say , and how they work ethnography can also be used in other methodological frameworks , for instance , an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation of people ( informants ) in '' naturally occurring settings '' that are commonly referred to as '' the field in the past , kinship charts were commonly used to '' discover logical patterns and social structure in non-western societies '' in the 21st century , anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed reflexivity refers to the researcher 's aim '' to explore the ways in which the researcher 's involvement with a particular study influences , acts upon and informs such research '' these informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community , often using snowball or chain sampling ethnography is very useful in social research ( 2010 ) examine the ontological and epistemological presuppositions underlying ethnography research can range from an objectivist account of fixed , observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing '' the interplay of individual agency and social structure '' the image is the projection that an individual puts on an object or abstract idea an image can be contained within the physical world through a particular individual 's perspective , primarily based on that individual 's past experiences the physical entity that is the novel contains a specific image in the perspective of the interpreting individual and can only be expressed by the individual in the terms of '' i can tell you what an image is by telling you what it feels like social movement , and criminology are other fields which have made use of ethnography cultural anthropology and social anthropology were developed around ethnographic research and their canonical texts , which are mostly ethnographies : e.g the typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people , almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends using language or community boundaries to bound the ethnography is common shadowed lives : undocumented workers in american society ( case studies in cultural anthropology ) an ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture , society , or community folk notions of botany and zoology are presented as ethnobotany and ethnozoology alongside references from the formal sciences material culture , technology , and means of subsistence are usually treated next , as they are typically bound up in physical geography and include descriptions of infrastructure as ethnography developed , anthropologists grew more interested in less tangible aspects of culture , such as values , worldview and what clifford geertz termed the '' ethos '' of the culture then , he sought to determine in what contexts winks were used , and whether , as one moved about a region , winks remained meaningful in the same way in this way , cultural boundaries of communication could be explored , as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence the interpretation of culture , chapter one within cultural anthropology , there are several subgenres of ethnography beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s , anthropologists began writing '' bio-confessional '' ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research scholars of communication studies use ethnographic research methods to analyze communicative behaviors and phenomena ethnographic work in communication studies seeks to explain '' how '' ordinary methods/practices/performances construct the ordinary actions used by ordinary people in the accomplishments of their identities often this type of research results in a case study or field study such as an analysis of speech patterns at a protest rally , or the way firemen communicate during '' down time '' at a fire station the american anthropologist george spindler was a pioneer in applying the ethnographic methodology

on the people and animals they study '' american anthropology association code of ethics , p.5-6 research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people these relationships are sometimes not accounted for within the reporting of the ethnography , although they may influence the research findings

gerhard friedrich müller developed the concept of ethnography as a separate discipline whilst participating in the second kamchatka expedition ( 1733–43 ) as a professor of history and geography whilst involved in the expedition , he differentiated völker-beschreibung as a distinct area of study this became known as '' ethnography , '' following the introduction of the greek neologism ethnographia by johann friedrich schöpperlin and the german variant by a digital ethnography is also seen as virtual ethnography this type of ethnography is not so typical as ethnography recorded by pen and pencil traditional ethnography may use videos or images , but digital ethnography goes more in-depth for example , digital ethnographers would use social media platforms such as twitter or blogs so that people 's interactions and behaviors can be studied most ethnographies take place in specific places where the observer can observe specific instances that relate to the topic involved relational ethnography articulates studying fields rather than places or processes rather than processed people meaning that relational ethnography does n't take an object nor a bounded group that is defined by its members shared social features nor a specific location that is delimited by the boundaries of a particular area features of ethnographic research in this regard , the best way to integrate ethnography in a quantitative research would be to use it to discover and uncover relationships and then use the resultant data to test and explain the empirical assumptions ( 2018 ) understanding ethnography : an 'exotic ' ethnographer 's perspective in ethnography , the researcher gathers what is available , what is normal , what it is that people do , what they say , and how they work ethnography can also be used in other methodological frameworks , for instance , an action research program of study where one of the goals is to change and improve the situation of people ( informants ) in '' naturally occurring settings '' that are commonly referred to as '' the field multiple methods of data collection may be employed to facilitate a relationship that allows for a more personal and in-depth portrait of the informants and their community interviews are often taped and later transcribed , allowing the interview to proceed unimpaired of note-taking , but with all information available later for full analysis secondary research and document analysis are also used to provide insight into the research topic in the past , kinship charts were commonly used to '' discover logical patterns and social structure in non-western societies '' in the 21st century , anthropology focuses more on the study of people in urban settings and the use of kinship charts is seldom employed reflexivity refers to the researcher 's aim '' to explore the ways in which the researcher 's involvement with a particular study influences , acts upon and informs such research '' this factor has provided a basis to criticize ethnography these informants are typically asked to identify other informants who represent the community , often using snowball or chain sampling ethnography is very useful in social research research can range from an objectivist account of fixed , observable behaviors to an interpretive narrative describing '' the interplay of individual agency and social structure '' another form of data collection is that of the '' image the image presents the perspective , experiences , and influences of an individual as a single entity and in consequence , the individual will always contain this image in the group under study social movement , and criminology are other fields which have made use of ethnography cultural and social anthropology cultural anthropology and social anthropology were developed around ethnographic research and their canonical texts , which are mostly ethnographies : e.g argonauts of the western pacific ( 1922 ) by bronisław malinowski , ethnologische excursion in johore ( 1875 ) by nicholas miklouho-maclay , coming of age in samoa ( 1928 ) by margaret mead , the nuer ( 1940 ) by e the typical ethnography is a document written about a particular people , almost always based at least in part on emic views of where the culture begins and ends ethnographies are also sometimes called '' case studies ethnographers study and interpret culture , its universalities , and its variations through the ethnographic study based on fieldwork an ethnography is a specific kind of written observational science which provides an account of a particular culture , society , or community ruth fulton benedict uses examples of enthrotyhy in her serious of field work that began in 1922 of serrano , of the zuni in 1924 , the cochiti in 1925 and the pina in 1926 kinship and social structure ( including age grading , peer groups , gender , voluntary associations , clans , moieties , and so forth , if they exist ) are typically included practices of child rearing , acculturation , and emic views on personality and values usually follow after sections on social structure in his fieldwork , geertz used elements of a phenomenological approach , tracing not just the doings of people , but the cultural elements themselves for example , if within a group of people , winking was a communicative gesture , he sought to first determine what kinds of things a wink might mean ( it might mean several things ) in this way , cultural boundaries of communication could be explored , as opposed to using linguistic boundaries or notions about the residence beginning in the 1950s and early 1960s , anthropologists began writing '' bio-confessional '' ethnographies that intentionally exposed the nature of ethnographic research later '' reflexive '' ethnographies refined the technique to translate cultural differences by representing their effects on the ethnographer urban sociology , atlanta university ( now clark-atlanta university ) , and the chicago school , in particular , are associated with ethnographic research , with some well-known early examples being the philadelphia negro ( 1899 ) by w '' american anthropology association code of ethics , p.5-6 research results of ethnographies should not be withheld from participants in the research if that research is being observed by other people 270-77 '' the honest ethnographer '' – if research participants know the research goals , their responses will likely be skewed the following are commonly misconceived conceptions of ethnographers : '' the candid ethnographer '' – where the researcher personally situates within the ethnography is ethically problematic

the alliterative hendiadys nacht und nebel ( german for '' night and fog '' ) is documented in german since the beginning of the 17th century grimmsches wörterbuch it was used by wagner in das rheingold ( 1869 ) and has since been adopted into everyday german ( e.g it is not clear whether the term nacht-und-nebel-erlass ( '' night and fog directive '' ) had been in wide circulation or used publicly before 1945 the designation '' nn '' was sometimes used , however , to refer to prisoners and deportees ( '' nn-gefangener '' , '' nn-häftling '' , '' nn-sache '' ) at the time the abbreviation '' nn '' was otherwise well known in german to mean '' nullus nomen '' ( '' without name '' for security reasons ) , similar to the english nn for '' nomen nescio '' even before the holocaust gained momentum , the nazis had begun rounding up political prisoners from both germany and occupied europe most of the early prisoners were of two sorts : they were either political prisoners of personal conviction or belief whom the nazis deemed in need of '' re-education '' to nazi ideals , or resistance leaders in occupied western europe hitler and nazi germany : a history , pp up until the time of the nacht und nebel decree , prisoners from western europe were handled by german soldiers in approximately the same way as by other countries : according to international agreements and procedures such as the geneva convention nazi germany 1933–1945 : faith and annihilation , pp and reinhard heydrich 's sicherheitsdienst ( security service ; sd ) was given responsibility for over-seeing and carrying out the nacht und nebel decree the decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission , by denying friends and families of seized persons any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate the prisoners were secretly transported to germany , and vanished without a trace in 1945 , abandoned sd records were found to include merely names and the initials '' nn '' ( nacht und nebel ) ; even the sites of graves were unrecorded himmler immediately communicated keitel 's directive to various ss stations and within six months , the decree was sent to concentration camp commanders by richard glücks the nacht und nebel prisoners were mostly from france , belgium , luxembourg , denmark , the netherlands , and norway they were usually arrested in the middle of the night and quickly taken to prisons hundreds of kilometres away for questioning , eventually arriving at concentration camps such as natzweiler , esterwegen or gross-rosen , if they survived the theory and practice of hell : the german concentration camps and the system behind them , pp natzweiler concentration camp in particular , became an isolation camp for political prisoners from northern and western europe under the decree 's mandate the policy , enforced in german-occupied europe , meant that whenever someone was arrested , the family would learn nothing about the person 's fate the people arrested , sometimes only suspected resisters , were secretly sent to germany and perhaps to a concentration camp this was done to keep the population in occupied countries quiet by promoting an atmosphere of mystery , fear and terror '' nacht und nebel erlaß , '' in lexikon nationalsozialismus : begriffe , organisationen und institutionen , p according to historian wolfgang sofsky , prisoners of the nacht und nebel transports were marked by broad red bands ; on their backs and both trouser legs was a cross , with the letters '' nn '' to its right if a camp did not have a gas chamber of its own , the so-called muselmann , or prisoners who were too sick to work , were often killed or transferred to other concentration camps for extermination although captured archives from the sd contain numerous orders stamped with '' nn '' ( nacht und nebel ) , it has never been determined exactly how many people disappeared as a result of the decree what we knew : terror , mass murder , and everyday life in nazi germany the theory and practice of hell : the german concentration camps and the system behind them

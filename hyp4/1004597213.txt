he wrote that '' the time has passed when the russians had no instinct for technology '' and that germany would have to reckon '' with the eastern question in a form more serious than ever before in history '' however , during the planning for operation barbarossa , the german invasion of the soviet union , he had become optimistic about the supposed superiority of german arms by may 1941 guderian had accepted hitler 's official position that operation barbarossa was a preemptive war he had accepted some core elements of national socialism : the lebensraum concept of territorial expansion and the destruction of the supposed judeo-bolshevik threat the combined forces of 2nd and 3rd panzer army closed the minsk pocket , taking 300,000 prisoners before attacking towards smolensk halder had guderian fly in to führer 's headquarters to argue the army 's case for continuing the assault against moscow by 15 september , german forces including the 1st and 2nd panzer groups had completed the largest encirclement in history , the battle of kiev owing to the 2nd panzer group 's southward turn during the battle , the wehrmacht destroyed the entire southwestern front east of kiev , inflicting over 600,000 losses on the red army by 26 september guderian 's 2nd panzer group was in the worst shape ; it had just 21 per cent of its tanks in working order by november , the attack by the 2nd panzer group on tula and kashira , south of moscow , achieved limited success , while guderian vacillated between despair and optimism , depending on the situation at the front in the aftermath of the battle , guderian blamed slow commitment of 4th army to the attack for the german failure to reach moscow it also failed to appreciate the reality that moscow was a metropolis that german forces lacked the numbers to either encircle or to capture in a frontal assault in the aftermath of the german failure , guderian refused to pass on hitler 's 'stand fast ' order and fell out with kluge , the new commander of the army group centre after the war , guderian claimed that his actions in the final months as head of the okh were driven by a search for a solution to germany 's increasingly bleak prospects despite the general 's later claims of being anti-nazi , hitler most likely found guderian 's values to be closely aligned with nazi ideology guderian 's german memoirs were first published in 1950 units under his command carried out the commissar order , which entailed the murder of red army political officers in 1976 , the leading wargaming magazine , strategy and tactics , spotlighted guderian in a featured game of the month called panzergruppe guderian

it had just 21 per cent of its tanks in working order it also failed to appreciate the reality that moscow was a metropolis that german forces lacked the numbers to either encircle or to capture in a frontal assault in the aftermath of the german failure , guderian refused to pass on hitler 's 'stand fast ' order and fell out with kluge , the new commander of the army group centre in his memoirs , guderian denied having given the commissar order in september 1942 , when erwin rommel was recuperating in germany from health problems , he suggested guderian to okw as the only man suitable to replace him in africa on 1 march 1943 , after the german defeat in the battle of stalingrad , hitler appointed guderian to the newly created position of inspector general of armoured troops the military failures of 1943 prevented guderian from restoring combat power to the armored forces to any significant degree guderian became the acting chief of the general staff of the army high command with the responsibility of advising hitler on the eastern front guderian 's post-war autobiography panzer leader was a success with the reading public guderian claimed , contrary to historical evidence , that the criminal commissar order was not carried out by his troops because it '' never reached his panzer group ''

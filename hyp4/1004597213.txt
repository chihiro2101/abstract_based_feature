early life and world war i on 1 october 1913 , he married margarete goerne with whom he had two sons , heinz günther ( 2 august 1914 – 2004 ) and kurt ( 17 september 1918 – 1984 ) at the outbreak of world war i guderian served as a communications officer and the commander of a radio station between may 1915 and january 1916 , guderian was in charge of signals intelligence for the 4th army on 28 february 1918 , guderian was appointed to the general staff corps he disagreed with germany signing the armistice in 1918 , believing that the german empire should have continued the fight early in 1919 , guderian was selected as one of the four thousand officers allowed by the versailles treaty in the reduced-size german army , the reichswehr in june 1919 , guderian joined the iron brigade ( later known as the iron division ) as its second general staff officer he studied the leading european literature on armored warfare and between 1922 and 1928 wrote five papers for military weekly , an armed forces journal while the topics covered were mundane , guderian related them to why germany had lost world war i , a controversial subject at the time , and thus raised his profile in the military there were some trial maneuvers conducted in the soviet union and guderian academically evaluated the results in 1927 , guderian was promoted to major and in october he was posted to the transport section of the truppenamt , a clandestine form of the army 's general staff , which had been forbidden by the treaty of versailles in 1931 , he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and became chief of staff to the inspectorate of motorized troops under oswald lutz this placed guderian at the center of germany 's development of mobile warfare and armored forces in the 1930s guderian played a significant role in the development of both the panzer division concept and a doctrine of mechanized offensive warfare that would later become known as blitzkrieg guderian 's 3rd motor transport battalion became the blueprint for the future german armored force however , his role was less central than he claimed in his memoirs and than historians repeated in the post-war era guderian and his immediate superior lutz had a symbiotic relationship guderian was the public face advocating mechanized warfare and lutz worked behind the scenes guderian reached into the nazi regime to promote the panzer force concept , attract support and secure resources lutz was dismissed and replaced by guderian in the spring of that year guderian had his first experience of commanding a panzer force during the anschluss the mobilization was chaotic , tanks ran out of fuel or broke down , and the combat value of the formation was non-existent he stood beside the führer in linz as hitler addressed germany and austria in celebration during august 1939 guderian took command of the newly formed xix army corps under his corps command was one of germany 's six panzer divisions ; guderian 's corps controlled 14.5 per cent of germany 's armoured fighting vehicles guderian had accomplished his first operational victory and he gave a tour of the battlefield to hitler and heinrich himmler , head of the ss the next day he shifted his corps across east prussia to participate in the advance on warsaw on 16 september , guderian launched an attack on brest litovsk ; the next day the soviet union invaded poland the soviet union 's entry into the war shattered polish morale and polish forces began to surrender en masse to guderian 's troops at the conclusion of the campaign , guderian was awarded a knight 's cross of the iron cross foremost in his mind was the '' liberation '' of his former family estate at gross-klonia ; guderian ordered the advance on gross-klonia at night and through fog , leading to what he subsequently admitted were '' serious casualties '' during the invasion , the german military mistreated and killed prisoners of war , ignoring both the geneva convention and their own army regulations he learned of murder operations and of jews being forced into nazi ghettos from his son , heinz günther guderian , who had witnessed some of them guderian was involved in the strategic debates that preceded the invasion of france and the low countries the manstein plan shifted the weight of the armoured formations away from a head-on attack through the low countries to one through the ardennes guderian 's corps spearheaded the drive through the ardennes and over the meuse river guderian 's panzer group led the '' race to the sea '' , ending with the british expeditionary force ( bef ) and french forces trapped at dunkirk despite the success of the invasion , french defeat was not inevitable ; the french had better , more numerous military equipment and were not overwhelmed by a numerically or technologically superior military force instead , the french loss stemmed from poor army morale , faulty military strategy and a lack of coordination among allied troops however , during the planning for operation barbarossa , the german invasion of the soviet union , he had become optimistic about the supposed superiority of german arms by may 1941 guderian had accepted hitler 's official position that operation barbarossa was a preemptive war by 15 september , german forces including the 1st and 2nd panzer groups had completed the largest encirclement in history , the battle of kiev however , the campaign had been costly ; the german forces had just half the tanks they had three months earlier hitler placed guderian in charge of the '' honour court '' ; a kangaroo court for those accused of involvement in the 20 july plot as chief-of-staff of the okh , guderian did not object to the orders that hitler and himmler issued during the brutal suppression of the warsaw uprising nor the atrocities being perpetrated against the civilian population of the city guderian and his staff surrendered to us forces on 10 may 1945 guderian 's post-war autobiography panzer leader was a success with the reading public hart adds that his strengths were outweighed by his deficiencies , such as deliberately creating animosity between his panzer force and the other military arms , with disastrous consequences guderian also did not mention that he had initially requested an estate three times larger , but he was turned down by the local gauleiter , with support from himmler with resolute support for the regime , the generals unquestioningly waged one war of aggression after the other , and , once barbarossa began , willingly partook in the genocide of the nazi regime '' the magazine featured a glowing profile of guderian where he was identified as the originator of blitzkrieg and lauded for his military achievements

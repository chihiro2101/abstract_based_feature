in recent years , it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding it also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline 's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines , both in methods and software technology its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building development of computer algorithms and software ( applied ai science ) that make this theoretical knowledge available to the user at least two journals , the italian archeologia e calcolatori and the british archaeological computing newsletter , are dedicated to archaeological computing methods quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research thus , providing students of archaeology with a solid background in quantitative sciences such as mathematics , statistics and computer sciences seems today more important than ever the most important platform for students and researchers in quantitative archaeology and ai science is the international conference on computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa ) which has been in existence for more than 30 years now and is held in a different city of europe each year computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology archeologia e calcolatori journal homepage archaeological computing newsletter homepage , now a supplement to archeologia e calcolatori computational archaeology computational archaeology blog '' computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa '' ) '' international conference on cultural heritage and new technologies '' ( formerly : '' workshop arch√§ologie und computer '' at vienna )

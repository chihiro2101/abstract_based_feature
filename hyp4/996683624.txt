ai science is an emerging discipline that attempts to uncover , quantitatively represent and explore specific properties and patterns of archaeological information fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures this opens archaeological analysis to a wide range of computer-based information processing methods fit to solve problems of great complexity it also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline 's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines , both in methods and software technology its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building there is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology at least two journals , the italian archeologia e calcolatori and the british archaeological computing newsletter , are dedicated to archaeological computing methods quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology archeologia e calcolatori journal homepage archaeological computing newsletter homepage , now a supplement to archeologia e calcolatori computational archaeology computational archaeology blog in cultural informatics university of washington digital archaeology research lab the computational archaeology lab at san diego state university focuses on open-science and open-source approaches to gis , agent based modeling , imagery analysis , and computation in archaeology and coupled human-natural systems science

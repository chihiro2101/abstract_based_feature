in recent years , it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process ai science is an emerging discipline that attempts to uncover , quantitatively represent and explore specific properties and patterns of archaeological information fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures this opens archaeological analysis to a wide range of computer-based information processing methods fit to solve problems of great complexity it also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline 's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines , both in methods and software technology its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building there is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research archeologia e calcolatori journal homepage archaeological computing newsletter homepage , now a supplement to archeologia e calcolatori computational archaeology computational archaeology blog cultural and educational technology institute is a research institute which constitutes an integrated research environment with continuous interaction with the academic community , in particular with the democritus university of thrace , the national and european educational and cultural technology industry , the international scientific community and the public sector l - p : archaeology archaeovision oxford archaeology digital archaeology data service intrasis gis arctron ( in german ) open context : experimental system for archaeological data-sharing archaeological analytics : digital content for north american material culture

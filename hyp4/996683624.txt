fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures this opens archaeological analysis to a wide range of computer-based information processing methods fit to solve problems of great complexity it also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline 's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines , both in methods and software technology development of computer algorithms and software ( applied ai science ) that make this theoretical knowledge available to the user there is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology at least two journals , the italian archeologia e calcolatori and the british archaeological computing newsletter , are dedicated to archaeological computing methods quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research they also build a bridge between archaeology and numerous quantitative sciences such as geophysics , geoinformation sciences and applied statistics the most important platform for students and researchers in quantitative archaeology and ai science is the international conference on computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa ) which has been in existence for more than 30 years now and is held in a different city of europe each year archeologia e calcolatori journal homepage archaeological computing newsletter homepage , now a supplement to archeologia e calcolatori computational archaeology computational archaeology blog '' computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa '' ) '' international conference on cultural heritage and new technologies '' ( formerly : '' workshop arch√§ologie und computer '' at vienna )

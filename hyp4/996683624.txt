in recent years , it has become clear that archaeologists will only be able to harvest the full potential of quantitative methods and computer technology if they become aware of the specific pitfalls and potentials inherent in the archaeological data and research process fundamental research on data and methods for a self-sufficient archaeological approach to information processing produces quantitative methods and computer software specifically geared towards archaeological problem solving and understanding ai science is capable of complementing and enhancing almost any area of scientific archaeological research it incorporates a large part of the methods and theories developed in processual archaeology since the 1960s but goes beyond former attempts at quantifying archaeology by exploring ways to represent general archaeological information and problem structures as computer algorithms and data structures it also promotes a formalized understanding of the discipline 's research objects and creates links between archaeology and other quantitative disciplines , both in methods and software technology its agenda can be split up in two major research themes that complement each other : fundamental research ( theoretical ai science ) on the structure , properties and possibilities of archaeological data , inference and knowledge building there is already a large body of literature on the use of quantitative methods and computer-based analysis in archaeology quantitative approaches to archaeological information handling and inference constitute a critical body of scientific methods in archaeological research the most important platform for students and researchers in quantitative archaeology and ai science is the international conference on computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa ) which has been in existence for more than 30 years now and is held in a different city of europe each year caa 2003 , computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology archeologia e calcolatori journal homepage archaeological computing newsletter homepage , now a supplement to archeologia e calcolatori computational archaeology computational archaeology blog '' computer applications and quantitative methods in archaeology ( caa '' ) '' international conference on cultural heritage and new technologies '' ( formerly : '' workshop arch√§ologie und computer '' at vienna )

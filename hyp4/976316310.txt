unlike h2g2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole your contributions will be edited , rearranged , re-worded and expanded , and you should n't be shy about doing the same to other people 's work like h2g2 researchers , most wikipedians try to avoid personal attacks here on wikipedia , you will have a '' user page '' with a function similar to your own personal space on h2g2 for example , you may want to link to your h2g2 personal space from your wikipedia user page a userbox has been created specifically to help you do this , called user : ubx/h2g2 you can , therefore , move any unedited entries that you have personally written on h2g2 to wikipedia for collaborative unedited entries , or entries you did not write , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) however , you can contribute the original version to wikipedia you could also ask not panicking ltd for permission to submit the approved version to wikipedia also , wikipedia has a much higher proportion of links per article than h2g2 on wikipedia there 's a genuine plethora of people and locations to ask for help , either generally or more specifically about the transfer from h2g2 to wikipedia

unlike h2g2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia 's style may sound dry at first to you remember that it 's not wikipedia 's place , as an encyclopedia , to give advice or suggest good restaurants be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated to a greater extent than h2g2 's reactive moderation system here on wikipedia , you will have a '' user page '' with a function similar to your own personal space on h2g2 for example , you may want to link to your h2g2 personal space from your wikipedia user page a userbox has been created specifically to help you do this , called user : ubx/h2g2 it looks like this : use this code to add it to your user page , replacing u123 with your own u-number from h2g2 : you may also be interested in reading h2g2 's entry about wikipedia for collaborative unedited entries , or entries you did not write , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) however , you can contribute the original version to wikipedia it is similar to h2g2 's requirements for balance in edited entries on controversial subjects , but there are subtle differences in the two policies moving content from wikipedia to h2g2

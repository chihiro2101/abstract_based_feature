wikipedia is focused on making an encyclopedia unlike h2g2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole remember that it 's not wikipedia 's place , as an encyclopedia , to give advice or suggest good restaurants be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated to a greater extent than h2g2 's reactive moderation system here on wikipedia , you will have a '' user page '' with a function similar to your own personal space on h2g2 for example , you may want to link to your h2g2 personal space from your wikipedia user page a userbox has been created specifically to help you do this , called user : ubx/h2g2 moving content from h2g2 to wikipedia you can , therefore , move any unedited entries that you have personally written on h2g2 to wikipedia for collaborative unedited entries , or entries you did not write , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) it is similar to h2g2 's requirements for balance in edited entries on controversial subjects , but there are subtle differences in the two policies on wikipedia there 's a genuine plethora of people and locations to ask for help , either generally or more specifically about the transfer from h2g2 to wikipedia

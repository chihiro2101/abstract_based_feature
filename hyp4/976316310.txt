unlike h2g2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole the edited guide entries knocking on doors and first kiss , last kiss , best kiss and worst kiss for instance , are great h2g2 content but would be out of place here be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated to a greater extent than h2g2 's reactive moderation system many people are members of several different collaboratively written encyclopedia projects at once for example , you may want to link to your h2g2 personal space from your wikipedia user page it looks like this : use this code to add it to your user page , replacing u123 with your own u-number from h2g2 : you may also be interested in reading h2g2 's entry about wikipedia moving content from h2g2 to wikipedia please copy your good encyclopedic content from h2g2 to wikipedia ! do n't forget to search for related wikipedia content first & mdash ; if wikipedia already has an article on the subject , just merge your own content into it : be bold ! for collaborative unedited entries , or entries you did not write , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) also , wikipedia has a much higher proportion of links per article than h2g2 the best course of action would be to save a local copy of your wikipedia article on your computer before anyone else edits it on wikipedia there 's a genuine plethora of people and locations to ask for help , either generally or more specifically about the transfer from h2g2 to wikipedia

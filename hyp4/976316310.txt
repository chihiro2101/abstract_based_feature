unlike h2g2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia 's style may sound dry at first to you remember that it 's not wikipedia 's place , as an encyclopedia , to give advice or suggest good restaurants be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated to a greater extent than h2g2 's reactive moderation system here on wikipedia , you will have a '' user page '' with a function similar to your own personal space on h2g2 moving content from h2g2 to wikipedia you can , therefore , move any unedited entries that you have personally written on h2g2 to wikipedia mention on the wikipedia article 's talk page ( click '' discuss this page '' ) that you originally wrote the material for h2g2 and give your researcher number ( u-number ) , so that nobody thinks you 're committing plagiarism for collaborative unedited entries , or entries you did not write , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) wikipedia titles are generally shorter , so phrases like '' a short guide to '' should be removed , and most titles should only have lower-case letters on wikipedia we try to quote opinions from people who are influential , or have some special expertise , and the best people for that generally wo n't be wikipedians on wikipedia there 's a genuine plethora of people and locations to ask for help , either generally or more specifically about the transfer from h2g2 to wikipedia

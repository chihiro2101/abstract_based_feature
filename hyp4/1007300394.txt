he began his studies in engineering at the technical university of budapest in 1918 , later in germany , at the charlottenburg technical university in berlin , now known as the technical university of berlin at the start of his career , he analysed the properties of high voltage electric transmission lines by using cathode-beam oscillographs , which led to his interest in electron optics studying the fundamental processes of the oscillograph , gabor was led to other electron-beam devices such as electron microscopes and tv tubes in 1933 gabor fled from nazi germany , where he was considered jewish , and was invited to britain to work at the development department of the british thomson-houston company in rugby , warwickshire gabor 's research focused on electron inputs and outputs , which led him to the invention of re-holography in 1948 gabor moved from rugby to imperial college london , and in 1958 became professor of applied physics until his retirement in 1967 in 1971 he was the single recipient of the nobel prize in physics with the motivation '' for his invention and development of the holographic method '' and presented the history of the development of holography from 1948 in his nobel lecture one of imperial college 's new halls of residence in prince 's gardens , knightsbridge is named gabor hall in honour of gabor 's contribution to imperial college he developed an interest in social analysis and published the mature society : a view of the future in 1972 the institute of physics also offers a dennis gabor medal and prize

circuit elements can be classified into different categories one is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components : one-port elementsthese represent the simplest components , that have only two terminals to connect to elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals passive elementsthese are elements which do not have a source of energy , examples are diodes , resistances , capacitances , and inductances another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function examples of linear elements are resistances , capacitances , inductances , and linear dependent sources nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function only nine types of element ( memristor not included ) , five passive and four active , are required to model any electrical component or circuit each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi two sources : current source , measured in amperes – produces a current in a conductor here \phi is the time integral of voltage but whether or not that represents a physical quantity depends on the nature of the voltage source for a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful , but for an electrochemical source , or a voltage that is the output of another circuit , no physical meaning is attached to it : :both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements three passive elements : resistance r , measured in ohms – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element four abstract active elements : voltage-controlled voltage source ( vcvs ) generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain there are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component : nullator : defined as v i 0 norator : defined as an element which places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever there are two lossless , passive , linear two-port elements that are normally introduced into network analysis the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements

circuit elements can be classified into different categories one is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components : one-port elementsthese represent the simplest components , that have only two terminals to connect to they connect to the external circuit through multiple pairs of terminals called ports for example , a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element ; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals which represent a port two-port elementsthese are the most common multiport elements , which have four terminals consisting of two ports elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources they can be used to represent ideal batteries and power supply dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals passive elementsthese are elements which do not have a source of energy , examples are diodes , resistances , capacitances , and inductances only nine types of element ( memristor not included ) , five passive and four active , are required to model any electrical component or circuit each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi : :both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements three passive elements : resistance r , measured in ohms â€“ produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element to more exactly describe the passive elements , their constitutive relation is used instead of simple proportionality from this it is supposed that there is a theoretical fourth passive element since there are only five elements in total ( not including the various dependent sources ) found in linear network analysis this is the case for all linear elements , but also for example , an ideal diode , which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor , has a constitutive relation of the form v f ( i ) networks built from the basic linear elements only are obliged to be reciprocal and so can not be used by themselves to represent a non-reciprocal system the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements a more refined model also includes a series inductance , to represent the effects of its lead inductance ( resistors constructed as a spiral have more significant inductance )

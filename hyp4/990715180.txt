elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals passive elementsthese are elements which do not have a source of energy , examples are diodes , resistances , capacitances , and inductances another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function examples of linear elements are resistances , capacitances , inductances , and linear dependent sources nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi two sources : current source , measured in amperes – produces a current in a conductor voltage source , measured in volts – produces a potential difference between two points affects magnetic flux according to the relation d\phi v\ , dt here \phi is the time integral of voltage but whether or not that represents a physical quantity depends on the nature of the voltage source for a voltage generated by magnetic induction it is meaningful , but for an electrochemical source , or a voltage that is the output of another circuit , no physical meaning is attached to it three passive elements : resistance r , measured in ohms – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element relates voltage and current according to the relation dv r\ , di inductance l , measured in henries – produces the magnetic flux proportional to the rate of change of current through the element current-controlled voltage source ( ccvs ) generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain memristance : constitutive relation defined as f ( \phi , q ) 0 the gyrator , on the other hand , maps a voltage at one port to a current at the other for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current

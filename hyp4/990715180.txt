one is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components : one-port elementsthese represent the simplest components , that have only two terminals to connect to they connect to the external circuit through multiple pairs of terminals called ports for example , a transformer with three separate windings has six terminals and could be idealized as a three-port element ; the ends of each winding are connected to a pair of terminals which represent a port elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals passive elementsthese are elements which do not have a source of energy , examples are diodes , resistances , capacitances , and inductances another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function circuits with nonlinear elements are harder to analyse and design , often requiring circuit simulation computer programs such as spice only nine types of element ( memristor not included ) , five passive and four active , are required to model any electrical component or circuit two sources : current source , measured in amperes â€“ produces a current in a conductor in the case of the current generator , q , the time integral of current , represents the quantity of electric charge physically delivered by the generator : :both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements four abstract active elements : voltage-controlled voltage source ( vcvs ) generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain current-controlled voltage source ( ccvs ) generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain current-controlled current source ( cccs ) generates a current based on an input current and a specified gain this is the case for all linear elements , but also for example , an ideal diode , which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor , has a constitutive relation of the form v f ( i ) the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current

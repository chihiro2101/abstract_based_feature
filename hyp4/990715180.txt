circuit elements can be classified into different categories two-port elementsthese are the most common multiport elements , which have four terminals consisting of two ports elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function circuits with only linear elements , linear circuits , do not cause intermodulation distortion , and can be easily analysed with powerful mathematical techniques such as the laplace transform nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function only nine types of element ( memristor not included ) , five passive and four active , are required to model any electrical component or circuit each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi three passive elements : resistance r , measured in ohms – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element relates voltage and current according to the relation dv r\ , di capacitance c , measured in farads – produces a current proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the element inductance l , measured in henries – produces the magnetic flux proportional to the rate of change of current through the element four abstract active elements : voltage-controlled voltage source ( vcvs ) generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain current-controlled voltage source ( ccvs ) generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain current-controlled current source ( cccs ) generates a current based on an input current and a specified gain there are also two special non-linear elements which are sometimes used in analysis but which are not the ideal counterpart of any real component : nullator : defined as v i 0 norator : defined as an element which places no restrictions on voltage and current whatsoever the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements for example , on a first degree of approximation , a bipolar transistor may be represented by a variable current source that is controlled by the input current

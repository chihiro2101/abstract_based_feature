circuit elements can be classified into different categories one is how many terminals they have to connect them to other components : one-port elementsthese represent the simplest components , that have only two terminals to connect to two-port elementsthese are the most common multiport elements , which have four terminals consisting of two ports elements can also be divided into active and passive : active elements or sourcesthese are elements which can source electrical power ; examples are voltage sources and current sources dependent sourcesthese are two-port elements with a voltage or current source which is proportional to the voltage or current at a second pair of terminals another distinction is between linear and nonlinear : linear elementsthese are elements in which the constituent relation , the relation between voltage and current , is a linear function circuits with only linear elements , linear circuits , do not cause intermodulation distortion , and can be easily analysed with powerful mathematical techniques such as the laplace transform nonlinear elementsthese are elements in which the relation between voltage and current is a nonlinear function only nine types of element ( memristor not included ) , five passive and four active , are required to model any electrical component or circuit each element is defined by a relation between the state variables of the network : current , i ; voltage , v , charge , q ; and magnetic flux , \phi two sources : current source , measured in amperes – produces a current in a conductor voltage source , measured in volts – produces a potential difference between two points : :both these elements are necessarily non-linear elements three passive elements : resistance r , measured in ohms – produces a voltage proportional to the current flowing through the element four abstract active elements : voltage-controlled voltage source ( vcvs ) generates a voltage based on another voltage with respect to a specified gain current-controlled voltage source ( ccvs ) generates a voltage based on an input current elsewhere in the circuit with respect to a specified gain current-controlled current source ( cccs ) generates a current based on an input current and a specified gain this is the case for all linear elements , but also for example , an ideal diode , which in circuit theory terms is a non-linear resistor , has a constitutive relation of the form v f ( i ) the following are examples of representation of components by way of electrical elements

the most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field stemming from this symptom , someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination a buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size a person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision dysmetropsia in one eye , a case of aniseikonia , can present with symptoms such as headaches , asthenopia , reading difficulties , depth perception problems , or double vision the visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience there is evidence that those who experience alice in wonderland syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail there may be no evidence of psychiatric disturbance and , as a result , no psychiatric therapy may be required psychological conditions often arise from macropsia , but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia psychologically , a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family the psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots field-dependent aniseikonia associated with an epiretinal membrane a case study aniseikonia is known to be associated with certain retinal conditions epiretinal membrane has been found to cause metamorphopsia and aniseikonia aniseikonia , metamorphopsia and perceived entoptic pattern : some effects of a macular epiretinal membrane , and the subsequent spontaneous separation of the membrane vitreomacular traction caused by the excessive vitreomacular adhesion to the retina is related to aniseikonia due to the separation and compression of photoreceptor cells micropsia and metamorphopsia in the re-attached macula following retinal detachment there is evidence that a lesion appearing in the posterior area of the ventral occippitotemporal visual pathway can cause macropsia macropsia caused by acute posterior cerebral artery infarction the most prevalent research on prescription drugs with side effects of macropsia deals with zolpidem and citalopram the intensity of the macropsia episodes decreased with the decreasing amount of zolpidem administered ; it is implied in the article that the level of intensity was based on the patients accounts of her macropsia episodes , and that no external diagnosis was used there are suggestions that visual distortions , such as macropsia , can be associated with cocaine use it is usually the macropsia or other visual disturbance which precedes the painful migrainous headaches 2002 jul ; 34 ( 4 ) : 348-52 macropsia may appear either before the onset , or after the resolution , of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness patients with coxsackievirus b1 have reported numerous symptoms of alice in wonderland syndrome , the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis , in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction macropsia is generally diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms , such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field the new aniseikonia test ( nat ) can quantify the degree of macropsia or micropsia independently in the vertical and horizontal meridians the problem with correction through optical means is that the optics do not vary with field angle and thus can not compensate for non-uniform macropsia macropsia , micropsia , and episodic illusions in japanese adolescents

the most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field stemming from this symptom , someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination a buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size a person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions symptoms caused chemically by drugs such as cannabis , magic mushrooms , or cocaine tend to dissipate after the chemical compound has been excreted from the body those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision dysmetropsia in one eye , a case of aniseikonia , can present with symptoms such as headaches , asthenopia , reading difficulties , depth perception problems , or double vision the visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images without suppression of one of the images symptoms from mild poor stereopsis , binocular diplopia and intolerable rivalry can occur there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience one competing theory has radically stated that macropsia may be an entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without any structural defect or definite cause there is evidence that those who experience alice in wonderland syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail psychological conditions often arise from macropsia , but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia psychologically , a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family he or she , in an attempt to balance the size distortion , may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior the psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots in cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images , the condition is known as aniseikonia aniseikonia is known to be associated with certain retinal conditions aniseikonia , metamorphopsia and perceived entoptic pattern : some effects of a macular epiretinal membrane , and the subsequent spontaneous separation of the membrane vitreomacular traction caused by the excessive vitreomacular adhesion to the retina is related to aniseikonia due to the separation and compression of photoreceptor cells micropsia and metamorphopsia in the re-attached macula following retinal detachment and surgical re-attachment for macula-of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can also cause an increased separation of macular photoreceptor cells resulting in dysmetropsia macropsia caused by acute posterior cerebral artery infarction the most prevalent research on prescription drugs with side effects of macropsia deals with zolpidem and citalopram zolpidem is a drug prescribed for insomnia , and although it has proven beneficial effects , there have been numerous reported cases of adverse perceptual reactions cinbis m , aysun s : alice in wonderland syndrome as an initial manifestation of epstein-barr virus infection ( case report ) patients with coxsackievirus b1 have reported numerous symptoms of alice in wonderland syndrome , the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis , in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction the problem with correction through optical means is that the optics do not vary with field angle and thus can not compensate for non-uniform macropsia patients have reported significantly improved visual comfort associated with a correction of 5-10 % of the aniseikonia overall , there have not been very many reports of macropsia induced by certain drugs , specifically zolpidem and citalopram once a larger effort is made to compile such reports , there will inevitably be more research on the subject of macropsia

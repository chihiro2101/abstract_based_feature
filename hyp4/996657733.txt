the most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field stemming from this symptom , someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination a buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size am j psychiatry 121:1123-1124 , may 1965 it is important to note , however , that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes , being able to recount specific details a person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision the visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience there is evidence that those who experience alice in wonderland syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail psychological conditions often arise from macropsia , but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia those afflicted may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes as a result of the overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field psychologically , a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family he or she , in an attempt to balance the size distortion , may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior the psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots aniseikonia , metamorphopsia and perceived entoptic pattern : some effects of a macular epiretinal membrane , and the subsequent spontaneous separation of the membrane vitreomacular traction caused by the excessive vitreomacular adhesion to the retina is related to aniseikonia due to the separation and compression of photoreceptor cells micropsia and metamorphopsia in the re-attached macula following retinal detachment retinoschisis is another eye disease that has been shown to cause aniseikonia there is evidence that a lesion appearing in the posterior area of the ventral occippitotemporal visual pathway can cause macropsia the most prevalent research on prescription drugs with side effects of macropsia deals with zolpidem and citalopram the intensity of the macropsia episodes decreased with the decreasing amount of zolpidem administered ; it is implied in the article that the level of intensity was based on the patients accounts of her macropsia episodes , and that no external diagnosis was used zolpidem-induced macropsia in anorexic woman the first case of macropsia thought to be induced by citalopram involves a woman who experienced macropsia after her first administration of 10 & nbsp ; mg citalopram there are suggestions that visual distortions , such as macropsia , can be associated with cocaine use past research has linked macropsia to migraine one of these studies was conducted on japanese adolescents who reported visual episodic illusions with macropsia and showed that illusions are three times more likely to occur in association with migraine adolescents who are deemed to have multiple distortions per episode , such as slow motion vision and macropsia , are even more likely to be sufferers of migraine anti-seizure medications appropriate for focal-onset seizures , like oxcarbazepine , have also been used successfully in the treatment of epilepsy-related macropsia macropsia may be a result of optical magnification differences between the eyes , retinal receptor distribution , or the cortical processing of the sampled image in some cases , the effects of macropsia have been shown to be field dependent , in that the degree of visual distortion is related to the visual field angle patients have reported significantly improved visual comfort associated with a correction of 5-10 % of the aniseikonia macropsia , micropsia , and episodic illusions in japanese adolescents

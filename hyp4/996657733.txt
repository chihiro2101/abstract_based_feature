the most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field stemming from this symptom , someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination am j psychiatry 121:1123-1124 , may 1965 it is important to note , however , that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes , being able to recount specific details a person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions symptoms caused chemically by drugs such as cannabis , magic mushrooms , or cocaine tend to dissipate after the chemical compound has been excreted from the body those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision the visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience there is evidence that those who experience alice in wonderland syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail psychological conditions often arise from macropsia , but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia those afflicted may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes as a result of the overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field psychologically , a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family the patient may falsely present an outgoing or flamboyant persona , while remaining fearful of people internally he or she , in an attempt to balance the size distortion , may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots in cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images , the condition is known as aniseikonia de wit gc , muraki cs aniseikonia , metamorphopsia and perceived entoptic pattern : some effects of a macular epiretinal membrane , and the subsequent spontaneous separation of the membrane there is evidence that a lesion appearing in the posterior area of the ventral occippitotemporal visual pathway can cause macropsia gen hosp psychiatry 1996 ; 18:452â€“453 the same woman later had two more episodes of zolpidem-induced macropsia , after taking 5 & nbsp ; mg and 2.5 & nbsp ; mg zolpidem , respective to each episode the similarities were that all the cases were reported by women , the disorganization and agitation followed the first administration of zolpidem , and once zolpidem was discontinued , there were no lasting residual effects the first case of macropsia thought to be induced by citalopram involves a woman who experienced macropsia after her first administration of 10 & nbsp ; mg citalopram there are suggestions that visual distortions , such as macropsia , can be associated with cocaine use episodes of temporary drug-induced macropsia subside as the chemicals leave the body past research has linked macropsia to migraine one of these studies was conducted on japanese adolescents who reported visual episodic illusions with macropsia and showed that illusions are three times more likely to occur in association with migraine no evidence of drugs was found , which eliminates the possibility of the macropsia in the adolescents being drug-induced a person with macropsia may fail to see the connection between the migraine and the macropsia , since the conditions may not elicit symptoms at the same time macropsia may present itself as a symptom of both frontal lobe epilepsy and temporal lobe epilepsy , which may actually help in the diagnosis of those diseases macropsia has been observed in experimental hypoglycaemia and in patients receiving insulin therapy macropsia may be a result of optical magnification differences between the eyes , retinal receptor distribution , or the cortical processing of the sampled image field dependent testing ) is especially important when the macropsia ( or micropsia ) has a retinal origin macropsia , micropsia , and episodic illusions in japanese adolescents

the most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field stemming from this symptom , someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination a buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size am j psychiatry 121:1123-1124 , may 1965 it is important to note , however , that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes , being able to recount specific details a person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions the visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience one competing theory has radically stated that macropsia may be an entirely psychological pathological phenomenon without any structural defect or definite cause there is evidence that those who experience alice in wonderland syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail there may be no evidence of psychiatric disturbance and , as a result , no psychiatric therapy may be required psychological conditions often arise from macropsia , but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia he or she , in an attempt to balance the size distortion , may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior the psychological impact of macropsia on long time sufferers who have had the condition since childhood may be greater and lead to severe ego-deficiencies in cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images , the condition is known as aniseikonia aniseikonia is known to be associated with certain retinal conditions micropsia and metamorphopsia in the re-attached macula following retinal detachment and surgical re-attachment for macula-of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can also cause an increased separation of macular photoreceptor cells resulting in dysmetropsia zolpidem is a drug prescribed for insomnia , and although it has proven beneficial effects , there have been numerous reported cases of adverse perceptual reactions the first case of macropsia thought to be induced by citalopram involves a woman who experienced macropsia after her first administration of 10 & nbsp ; mg citalopram it is unlikely that macropsia in japanese adolescents could be due to epileptic seizure since only 0.3 % of japanese adolescents have epilepsy it is usually the macropsia or other visual disturbance which precedes the painful migrainous headaches it may be subsequently concluded that the eeg is congruent with temporal or frontal lobe seizure anxiety and headaches accompany the episodes of visual distortion associated with epilepsy anti-seizure medications appropriate for focal-onset seizures , like oxcarbazepine , have also been used successfully in the treatment of epilepsy-related macropsia endogenous hypoglycaemia can result in number of visual disturbances and sometimes macropsia this kind of hypoglycaemia is defined as having an abnormally low blood-sugar level due to anything other than the exogenous administration of insulin abnormal magnetic resonance imaging in a child with alice in wonderland syndrome following epstein-barr virus infection no to hattatsu patients with coxsackievirus b1 have reported numerous symptoms of alice in wonderland syndrome , the most common of which being macropsia and micropsia asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis , in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction the new aniseikonia test ( nat ) can quantify the degree of macropsia or micropsia independently in the vertical and horizontal meridians the most common way to treat forms of aniseikonia , including macropsia , is through the use of auxiliary optics to correct for the magnification properties of the eyes future research may focus on ways to limit the occurrence of retinally-induced macropsia due to surgery overall , there have not been very many reports of macropsia induced by certain drugs , specifically zolpidem and citalopram

the most obvious symptom of macropsia is the presence of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field stemming from this symptom , someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination , indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination a buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size am j psychiatry 121:1123-1124 , may 1965 it is important to note , however , that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes , being able to recount specific details a person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision dysmetropsia in one eye , a case of aniseikonia , can present with symptoms such as headaches , asthenopia , reading difficulties , depth perception problems , or double vision the visual distortion can cause uncorrelated images to stimulate corresponding retinal regions simultaneously impairing fusion of the images without suppression of one of the images symptoms from mild poor stereopsis , binocular diplopia and intolerable rivalry can occur there are a broad range of psychological and emotional effects that a person suffering macropsia may experience there is evidence that those who experience alice in wonderland syndrome and associated macropsia are able to recount their experiences with thorough detail psychological conditions often arise from macropsia , but the general consensus is that they do not cause macropsia those afflicted may experience extreme anxiety both during and after episodes as a result of the overwhelming nature of his or her distorted visual field due to the fear and anxiety associated with the condition , those who have previously suffered an episode hesitate to recount the episode , although retain the ability to do so psychologically , a person with macropsia may feel separation and dissociation from the outside world and even from immediate family the patient may feel that he or she must unfairly contend with hostile and aggressive forces due to the gigantic nature of the surrounding environment he or she , in an attempt to balance the size distortion , may try to make others feel small in size through insult or hostile behavior an alternative interpretation of the condition is that macropsia is a response to biophysiological contraction and has no psychological roots in cases where macropsia affects one eye resulting in differences in the way the two eyes perceive the size or shape of images , the condition is known as aniseikonia field-dependent aniseikonia associated with an epiretinal membrane a case study aniseikonia is known to be associated with certain retinal conditions epiretinal membrane has been found to cause metamorphopsia and aniseikonia aniseikonia , metamorphopsia and perceived entoptic pattern : some effects of a macular epiretinal membrane , and the subsequent spontaneous separation of the membrane vitreomacular traction caused by the excessive vitreomacular adhesion to the retina is related to aniseikonia due to the separation and compression of photoreceptor cells micropsia and metamorphopsia in the re-attached macula following retinal detachment it is usually the macropsia or other visual disturbance which precedes the painful migrainous headaches the macropsia episodes associated with migraine are typically equivalent to the duration of the aura , which can range from moments to 15 minutes the pathophysiology of the condition is not fully understood , but the timing of some episodic occurrences with the headaches suggests that there is a connection between macropsia and the vasoconstrictive phase of a migraine 2002 jul ; 34 ( 4 ) : 348-52 macropsia may appear either before the onset , or after the resolution , of all clinical symptoms associated with the illness asymmetry has also been observed with retinoschisis , in which macropsia generally results in the vertical direction while micropsia presents in the horizontal direction macropsia is generally diagnosed once a patient complains of the characteristic symptoms , such as disproportionally large objects in their visual field field dependent testing ) is especially important when the macropsia ( or micropsia ) has a retinal origin once a larger effort is made to compile such reports , there will inevitably be more research on the subject of macropsia

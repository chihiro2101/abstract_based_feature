in august 1973 , nasa and esro ( now european space agency or esa ) signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to build a science laboratory for use on space shuttle flights 46 in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle , and also space research the nasa administrator at the time moved the focus from a new space station to space laboratory for planned space shuttle spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth when the habitable module was not used , some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo , a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew area spacelab mission typically supported multiple experiments , and the spacelab 1 mission had experiments in the fields of space plasma physics , solar physics , atmosphere physics , astronomy , and earth observation the selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for spacelab shuttle missions , and for example , a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets , or vice versa a pressurized tunnel connected the space shuttle orbiter main cabin to spacelab habitable module ( s ) , with a connection point at the mid-deck when the habitable module was not used , but additional space was needed for support equipment another structure called the igloo could be used it was also possible to operate spacelab experiments from the space shuttle orbiter aft flight deck the spacelab pallet is a u-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation , large instruments , experiments requiring exposure to space , and instruments requiring a large field of view , such as telescopes the spacelab pallet used to transport both canadarm-2 and dextre to the international space station is currently at the canada aviation and space museum , on loan from nasa through the canadian space agency ( csa ) ips was used on three different space shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995 science work was moved to the international space station and spacehab module , a pressurized carrier similar to the spacelab module the spacelab components were used on 32 shuttle missions in total spacelab history on nasa.gov spacelab : an international short-stay orbiting laboratory , nasa-ep-165 on nasa.gov science in orbit : the shuttle & spacelab experience , 1981â€“1986 , nasa-np-119 on nasa.gov spacelab payloads on shuttle flights on nasa.gov spacelab illustration for nasa publication ep-165

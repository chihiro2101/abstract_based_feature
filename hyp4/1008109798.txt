in august 1973 , nasa and esro ( now european space agency or esa ) signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to build a science laboratory for use on space shuttle flights later , nasa purchased lm2 , the second lab '' construction on the spacelab modules began in 1974 by what was then the company erno-vfw-fokker 46 in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle , and also space research spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth however , the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research when the habitable module was not used , some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo , a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew area spacelab mission typically supported multiple experiments , and the spacelab 1 mission had experiments in the fields of space plasma physics , solar physics , atmosphere physics , astronomy , and earth observation the selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for spacelab shuttle missions , and for example , a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets , or vice versa the spacelab module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as short or long module flown in the rear of the space shuttle cargo bay , connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel a pressurized tunnel connected the space shuttle orbiter main cabin to spacelab habitable module ( s ) , with a connection point at the mid-deck when the habitable module was not used , but additional space was needed for support equipment another structure called the igloo could be used the spacelab pallet is a u-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation , large instruments , experiments requiring exposure to space , and instruments requiring a large field of view , such as telescopes ips missions : spacelab 2 , a.k.a spacelab components flew on 22 space shuttle missions from november 1983 to april 1998 the spacelab components were used on 32 shuttle missions in total spacelab history on nasa.gov spacelab : an international short-stay orbiting laboratory , nasa-ep-165 on nasa.gov science in orbit : the shuttle & spacelab experience , 1981â€“1986 , nasa-np-119 on nasa.gov spacelab payloads on shuttle flights on nasa.gov spacelab illustration for nasa publication ep-165

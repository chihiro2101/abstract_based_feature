in august 1973 , nasa and esro ( now european space agency or esa ) signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to build a science laboratory for use on space shuttle flights construction of spacelab was started in 1974 by erno ( a subsidiary of vfw-fokker gmbh , after merger with mbb named mbb/erno , and merged into eads space transportation in 2003 ) later , nasa purchased lm2 , the second lab '' construction on the spacelab modules began in 1974 by what was then the company erno-vfw-fokker 46 in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle , and also space research spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth however , the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research when the habitable module was not used , some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo , a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew area the spacelab module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as short or long module flown in the rear of the space shuttle cargo bay , connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel when the habitable module was not used , but additional space was needed for support equipment another structure called the igloo could be used lm1 is on display at the udvar-hazy center at the national air and space museum behind the space shuttle discovery the spacelab pallet used to transport both canadarm-2 and dextre to the international space station is currently at the canada aviation and space museum , on loan from nasa through the canadian space agency ( csa ) a spacelab pallet was transferred to the swiss museum of transport for permanent display on 5 march 2010 ips was used on three different space shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995 science work was moved to the international space station and spacehab module , a pressurized carrier similar to the spacelab module the spacelab components were used on 32 shuttle missions in total the habitable modules were flown on 16 space shuttle missions in the 1980s and 1990s

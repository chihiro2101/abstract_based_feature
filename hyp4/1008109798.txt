46 in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle , and also space research the nasa administrator at the time moved the focus from a new space station to space laboratory for planned space shuttle spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth however , the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research when the habitable module was not used , some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo , a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew area spacelab mission typically supported multiple experiments , and the spacelab 1 mission had experiments in the fields of space plasma physics , solar physics , atmosphere physics , astronomy , and earth observation the selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for spacelab shuttle missions , and for example , a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets , or vice versa the spacelab module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as short or long module flown in the rear of the space shuttle cargo bay , connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel a pressurized tunnel connected the space shuttle orbiter main cabin to spacelab habitable module ( s ) , with a connection point at the mid-deck it was also possible to operate spacelab experiments from the space shuttle orbiter aft flight deck lm1 is on display at the udvar-hazy center at the national air and space museum behind the space shuttle discovery the spacelab pallet is a u-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation , large instruments , experiments requiring exposure to space , and instruments requiring a large field of view , such as telescopes up to five pallets can be configured in the space shuttle cargo bay by using a double pallet plus triple pallet configurations the spacelab pallet used to transport both canadarm-2 and dextre to the international space station is currently at the canada aviation and space museum , on loan from nasa through the canadian space agency ( csa ) . diagram , spacelab module and pallet space station freedom space shuttle retirement international space station columbus module columbus man-tended free flyer hermes ( spacecraft ) spacelab , a 1978 song by kraftwerk spacehab module , various , not to be confused with spacelab

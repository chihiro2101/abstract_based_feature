in august 1973 , nasa and esro ( now european space agency or esa ) signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to build a science laboratory for use on space shuttle flights construction of spacelab was started in 1974 by erno ( a subsidiary of vfw-fokker gmbh , after merger with mbb named mbb/erno , and merged into eads space transportation in 2003 ) 46 in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle , and also space research the nasa administrator at the time moved the focus from a new space station to space laboratory for planned space shuttle spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth however , the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research when the habitable module was not used , some of the support equipment for the pallets could be housed in the smaller igloo , a pressurized cylinder connected to the space shuttle orbiter crew area the selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for spacelab shuttle missions , and for example , a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets , or vice versa the spacelab module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory configurable as short or long module flown in the rear of the space shuttle cargo bay , connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel it was also possible to operate spacelab experiments from the space shuttle orbiter aft flight deck two habitable modules were built , named lm1 and lm2 the spacelab pallet is a u-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation , large instruments , experiments requiring exposure to space , and instruments requiring a large field of view , such as telescopes ips was used on three different space shuttle missions between 1985 and 1995 spacelab components flew on 22 space shuttle missions from november 1983 to april 1998 science work was moved to the international space station and spacehab module , a pressurized carrier similar to the spacelab module spacelab history on nasa.gov spacelab : an international short-stay orbiting laboratory , nasa-ep-165 on nasa.gov science in orbit : the shuttle & spacelab experience , 1981â€“1986 , nasa-np-119 on nasa.gov spacelab payloads on shuttle flights on nasa.gov spacelab illustration for nasa publication ep-165

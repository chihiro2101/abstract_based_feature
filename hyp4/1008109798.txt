in august 1973 , nasa and esro ( now european space agency or esa ) signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) to build a science laboratory for use on space shuttle flights construction of spacelab was started in 1974 by erno ( a subsidiary of vfw-fokker gmbh , after merger with mbb named mbb/erno , and merged into eads space transportation in 2003 ) the first lab module , lm1 , was donated to nasa in exchange for flight opportunities for european astronauts 46 in the early 1970s nasa shifted its focus from the lunar missions to the space shuttle , and also space research the nasa administrator at the time moved the focus from a new space station to space laboratory for planned space shuttle spacelab consisted of a variety of interchangeable components , with the major one being a crewed laboratory that could be flown in space shuttle orbiter 's bay and returned to earth however , the habitable module did not have to be flown to conduct a spacelab-type mission and there was a variety of pallets and other hardware supporting space research spacelab mission typically supported multiple experiments , and the spacelab 1 mission had experiments in the fields of space plasma physics , solar physics , atmosphere physics , astronomy , and earth observation the selection of appropriate modules was part of mission planning for spacelab shuttle missions , and for example , a mission might need less habitable space and more pallets , or vice versa a pressurized tunnel connected the space shuttle orbiter main cabin to spacelab habitable module ( s ) , with a connection point at the mid-deck lm1 is on display at the udvar-hazy center at the national air and space museum behind the space shuttle discovery up to five pallets can be configured in the space shuttle cargo bay by using a double pallet plus triple pallet configurations ips missions : spacelab 2 , a.k.a spacelab components flew on 22 space shuttle missions from november 1983 to april 1998 '' spacelab pallet â€“ deployable 2 ( slp-d2 ) '' was scheduled for sts-127 the spacelab components were used on 32 shuttle missions in total

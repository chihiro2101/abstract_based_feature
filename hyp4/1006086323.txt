there are several distinct branches of mathematical physics , and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods these approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics , continuum mechanics , classical field theory and quantum field theory following mathematics : the theory of partial differential equation , variational calculus , fourier analysis , potential theory , and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics the theory of atomic spectra ( and , later , quantum mechanics ) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra , the spectral theory of operators , operator algebras and more broadly , functional analysis nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes schrödinger operators , and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics this was group theory , which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry this was , however , gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena it relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics ( or its quantum version ) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory there are increasing interactions between combinatorics and physics , in particular statistical physics the usage of the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes idiosyncratic certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not , in fact , considered parts of mathematical physics , while other closely related fields are the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework in this sense , mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and physics theoretical aspect although related to theoretical physics , quote : '' implies his encyclopaedic knowledge of physics combined with possessing enough mathematical armament in the latter case , he is usually considered as a specialist in mathematical physics mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics on the other hand , theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and experimental physics , which often requires theoretical physicists ( and mathematical physicists in the more general sense ) to use heuristic , intuitive , and approximate arguments such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories because of the required level of mathematical rigour , these researchers often deal with questions that theoretical physicists have considered to be already solved the effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing not only developed physics but also has influenced developments of some mathematical areas the mathematical study of quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator algebras the attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory isaac newton ( 1642–1727 ) developed some concepts in calculus ( although gottfried wilhelm leibniz developed similar concepts outside the context of physics ) and newton 's method to solve problems in physics in england , george green ( 1793-1841 ) published an essay on the application of mathematical analysis to the theories of electricity and magnetism in 1828 , which in addition to its significant contributions to mathematics made early progress towards laying down the mathematical foundations of electricity and magnetism list of prominent contributors to mathematical physics in the 20th century

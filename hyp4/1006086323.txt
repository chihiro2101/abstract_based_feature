there are several distinct branches of mathematical physics , and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods these approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics , continuum mechanics , classical field theory and quantum field theory following mathematics : the theory of partial differential equation , variational calculus , fourier analysis , potential theory , and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics physical applications of these developments include hydrodynamics , celestial mechanics , continuum mechanics , elasticity theory , acoustics , thermodynamics , electricity , magnetism , and aerodynamics the theory of atomic spectra ( and , later , quantum mechanics ) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra , the spectral theory of operators , operator algebras and more broadly , functional analysis nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes schrödinger operators , and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics this was group theory , which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry this was , however , gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena in the mathematical description of this physical areas , some concepts in homological algebra and category theory are also important nowadays it relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics ( or its quantum version ) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory the usage of the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes idiosyncratic certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not , in fact , considered parts of mathematical physics , while other closely related fields are john herapath used the term for the title of his 1847 text on '' mathematical principles of natural philosophy '' ; the scope at that time being '' the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature '' john herapath ( 1847 ) mathematical physics ; or , the mathematical principles of natural philosophy , the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature , whittaker and company via hathitrust the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework in this sense , mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and physics theoretical aspect mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics such mathematical physicists primarily expand and elucidate physical theories however , they can sometimes show that the previous solution was incomplete , incorrect , or simply too naïve the effort to put physical theories on a mathematically rigorous footing not only developed physics but also has influenced developments of some mathematical areas the mathematical study of quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator algebras the attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory having ostensibly reduced the keplerian celestial laws of motion as well as galilean terrestrial laws of motion to a unifying force , newton achieved great mathematical rigor , but with theoretical laxity hamiltonian dynamics had played an important role in the formulation of modern theories in physics , including field theory and quantum mechanics together , these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory , fluid dynamics , and statistical mechanics it was hypothesized that the aether thus kept maxwell 's electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of galilean invariance across all inertial frames of reference , while newton 's theory of motion was spared

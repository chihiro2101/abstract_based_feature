there are several distinct branches of mathematical physics , and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods the rigorous , abstract and advanced reformulation of newtonian mechanics adopting the lagrangian mechanics and the hamiltonian mechanics even in the presence of constraints these approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics , continuum mechanics , classical field theory and quantum field theory following mathematics : the theory of partial differential equation , variational calculus , fourier analysis , potential theory , and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics physical applications of these developments include hydrodynamics , celestial mechanics , continuum mechanics , elasticity theory , acoustics , thermodynamics , electricity , magnetism , and aerodynamics the theory of atomic spectra ( and , later , quantum mechanics ) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra , the spectral theory of operators , operator algebras and more broadly , functional analysis nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes schrödinger operators , and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics this was group theory , which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry this was , however , gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena in the mathematical description of this physical areas , some concepts in homological algebra and category theory are also important nowadays statistical mechanics forms a separate field , which includes the theory of phase transitions it relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics ( or its quantum version ) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not , in fact , considered parts of mathematical physics , while other closely related fields are john herapath ( 1847 ) mathematical physics ; or , the mathematical principles of natural philosophy , the causes of heat , gaseous elasticity , gravitation , and other great phenomena of nature , whittaker and company via hathitrust the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework in this sense , mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and physics theoretical aspect implies his encyclopaedic knowledge of physics combined with possessing enough mathematical armament the mathematical study of quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and quantum statistical mechanics has motivated results in operator algebras the attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory antony g flew , dictionary of philosophy , rev 2nd edn ( new york : st martin 's press , 1984 ) , p 129 having introduced experimentation , galileo then refuted geocentric cosmology by refuting aristotelian physics itself by the galilean law of inertia as well as the principle of galilean invariance , also called galilean relativity , for any object experiencing inertia , there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at relative rest or relative motion—rest or motion with respect to another object rené descartes adopted galilean principles and developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology , anchored on the principle of vortex motion , cartesian physics , whose widespread acceptance brought the demise of aristotelian physics very relevant contributions to this approach are due to his german colleague mathematician carl gustav jacobi ( 1804–1851 ) in particular referring to canonical transformations together , these individuals laid the foundations of electromagnetic theory , fluid dynamics , and statistical mechanics it was hypothesized that the aether thus kept maxwell 's electromagnetic field aligned with the principle of galilean invariance across all inertial frames of reference , while newton 's theory of motion was spared ( under special relativity—a special case of general relativity—even massless energy exerts gravitational effect by its mass equivalence locally '' curving '' the geometry of the four , unified dimensions of space and time

there are several distinct branches of mathematical physics , and these roughly correspond to particular historical periods the rigorous , abstract and advanced reformulation of newtonian mechanics adopting the lagrangian mechanics and the hamiltonian mechanics even in the presence of constraints both formulations are embodied in analytical mechanics and lead to understanding the deep interplay of the notions of symmetry and conserved quantities during the dynamical evolution , as embodied within the most elementary formulation of noether theorem these approaches and ideas have been extended to other areas of physics as statistical mechanics , continuum mechanics , classical field theory and quantum field theory following mathematics : the theory of partial differential equation , variational calculus , fourier analysis , potential theory , and vector analysis are perhaps most closely associated with mathematical physics physical applications of these developments include hydrodynamics , celestial mechanics , continuum mechanics , elasticity theory , acoustics , thermodynamics , electricity , magnetism , and aerodynamics the theory of atomic spectra ( and , later , quantum mechanics ) developed almost concurrently with some parts of the mathematical fields of linear algebra , the spectral theory of operators , operator algebras and more broadly , functional analysis nonrelativistic quantum mechanics includes schrödinger operators , and it has connections to atomic and molecular physics this was group theory , which played an important role in both quantum field theory and differential geometry this was , however , gradually supplemented by topology and functional analysis in the mathematical description of cosmological as well as quantum field theory phenomena it relies upon the hamiltonian mechanics ( or its quantum version ) and it is closely related with the more mathematical ergodic theory and some parts of probability theory certain parts of mathematics that initially arose from the development of physics are not , in fact , considered parts of mathematical physics , while other closely related fields are for example , ordinary differential equations and symplectic geometry are generally viewed as purely mathematical disciplines , whereas dynamical systems and hamiltonian mechanics belong to mathematical physics the term '' mathematical physics '' is sometimes used to denote research aimed at studying and solving problems in physics or thought experiments within a mathematically rigorous framework in this sense , mathematical physics covers a very broad academic realm distinguished only by the blending of some mathematical aspect and physics theoretical aspect implies his encyclopaedic knowledge of physics combined with possessing enough mathematical armament in the latter case , he is usually considered as a specialist in mathematical physics mathematical physics in this sense emphasizes the mathematical rigour of the similar type as found in mathematics on the other hand , theoretical physics emphasizes the links to observations and experimental physics , which often requires theoretical physicists ( and mathematical physicists in the more general sense ) to use heuristic , intuitive , and approximate arguments the attempt to construct a rigorous mathematical formulation of quantum field theory has also brought about some progress in fields such as representation theory by the galilean law of inertia as well as the principle of galilean invariance , also called galilean relativity , for any object experiencing inertia , there is empirical justification for knowing only that it is at relative rest or relative motion—rest or motion with respect to another object rené descartes adopted galilean principles and developed a complete system of heliocentric cosmology , anchored on the principle of vortex motion , cartesian physics , whose widespread acceptance brought the demise of aristotelian physics into the early 19th century , following mathematicians in france , germany and england had contributed to mathematical physics the french pierre-simon laplace ( 1749–1827 ) made paramount contributions to mathematical astronomy , potential theory a couple of decades ahead of newton 's publication of a particle theory of light , the dutch christiaan huygens ( 1629–1695 ) developed the wave theory of light , published in 1690 list of prominent contributors to mathematical physics in the 20th century

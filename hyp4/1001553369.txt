softsynths can cover a range of synthesis methods , including subtractive synthesis ( including analog modeling , a subtype ) , fm synthesis ( including the similar phase distortion synthesis ) , physical modelling synthesis , additive synthesis ( including the related resynthesis ) , and sample-based synthesis many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software the emulation can even extend to having graphics that model the exact placements of the original hardware controls some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer popular synthesizers such as the minimoog , yamaha dx7 , korg m1 , prophet-5 , oberheim ob-x , roland jupiter 8 , arp 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software some softsynths are heavily sample-based , and frequently have more capability than hardware units , since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers when the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer , both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time however modern professional audio interfaces can frequently operate with extremely low latency , so in recent years this has become much less of a problem than in the early days of computer music the advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds , potentially increasing sound quality stand-alone softsynths run as a program on the computer so additional software is not required plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation , which records the music that is played : category : software synthesizers : category : music software plugin architectures digital audio editor modular synthesizer music sequencer digital audio workstation sound module synthesizer synthfont timidity++ video game music list of music software

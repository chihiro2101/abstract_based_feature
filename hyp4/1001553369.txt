many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer popular synthesizers such as the minimoog , yamaha dx7 , korg m1 , prophet-5 , oberheim ob-x , roland jupiter 8 , arp 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software some softsynths are heavily sample-based , and frequently have more capability than hardware units , since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers it is also possible to generate sound files offline , meaning sound generation does not have to be in real time , or live playing a wav or mp3 file simply means playing a precalculated waveform the advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds , potentially increasing sound quality also of note is software like csound and nyquist , which can be used to program software instruments stand-alone softsynths run as a program on the computer so additional software is not required plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation , which records the music that is played hardware manufacturers have also released apps for the ipad and iphone including moog music , korg , roland corporation , akai and tascam : category : software synthesizers : category : music software plugin architectures digital audio editor modular synthesizer music sequencer digital audio workstation sound module synthesizer synthfont timidity++ video game music list of music software

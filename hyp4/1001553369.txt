softsynths can cover a range of synthesis methods , including subtractive synthesis ( including analog modeling , a subtype ) , fm synthesis ( including the similar phase distortion synthesis ) , physical modelling synthesis , additive synthesis ( including the related resynthesis ) , and sample-based synthesis many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer some softsynths are heavily sample-based , and frequently have more capability than hardware units , since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers some of these sample-based synthesizers come with sample libraries many gigabytes in size the major downside of using softsynths can often be more latency ( delay between playing the note and hearing the corresponding sound ) however modern professional audio interfaces can frequently operate with extremely low latency , so in recent years this has become much less of a problem than in the early days of computer music the advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds , potentially increasing sound quality also of note is software like csound and nyquist , which can be used to program software instruments plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation , which records the music that is played hardware manufacturers have also released apps for the ipad and iphone including moog music , korg , roland corporation , akai and tascam : category : software synthesizers : category : music software plugin architectures digital audio editor modular synthesizer music sequencer digital audio workstation sound module synthesizer synthfont timidity++ video game music list of music software

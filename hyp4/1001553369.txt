many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer popular synthesizers such as the minimoog , yamaha dx7 , korg m1 , prophet-5 , oberheim ob-x , roland jupiter 8 , arp 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software some softsynths are heavily sample-based , and frequently have more capability than hardware units , since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers some of these sample-based synthesizers come with sample libraries many gigabytes in size many sample libraries are available in a common format like wav , when the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer , both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time the advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds , potentially increasing sound quality also of note is software like csound and nyquist , which can be used to program software instruments zynaddsubfx is an open-source software synthesizer for linux , macos and windows recently , there have been many virtual synthesizers released for apples ios devices ( ipad , iphone , and ipod touch ) hardware manufacturers have also released apps for the ipad and iphone including moog music , korg , roland corporation , akai and tascam

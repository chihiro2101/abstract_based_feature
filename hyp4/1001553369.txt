many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software the emulation can even extend to having graphics that model the exact placements of the original hardware controls some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer some softsynths are heavily sample-based , and frequently have more capability than hardware units , since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers many sample libraries are available in a common format like wav , the major downside of using softsynths can often be more latency ( delay between playing the note and hearing the corresponding sound ) when the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer , both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time it is also possible to generate sound files offline , meaning sound generation does not have to be in real time , or live the advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds , potentially increasing sound quality stand-alone softsynths run as a program on the computer so additional software is not required plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation , which records the music that is played zynaddsubfx is an open-source software synthesizer for linux , macos and windows

softsynths can cover a range of synthesis methods , including subtractive synthesis ( including analog modeling , a subtype ) , fm synthesis ( including the similar phase distortion synthesis ) , physical modelling synthesis , additive synthesis ( including the related resynthesis ) , and sample-based synthesis many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer popular synthesizers such as the minimoog , yamaha dx7 , korg m1 , prophet-5 , oberheim ob-x , roland jupiter 8 , arp 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software some softsynths are heavily sample-based , and frequently have more capability than hardware units , since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers when the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer , both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time however modern professional audio interfaces can frequently operate with extremely low latency , so in recent years this has become much less of a problem than in the early days of computer music image : cubase 6 feature - software instruments and software effects.svg thumb top : software instruments bottom : software effect processors on cubase 6 a software instrument can be a synthesized version of a real instrument ( like the sounds of a violin or drums ) , or a unique instrument , generated by computer software also of note is software like csound and nyquist , which can be used to program software instruments plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation , which records the music that is played many softsynths use mathematical algorithms that directly emulate the electronic components and circuitry of the original hardware synthesizer : category : software synthesizers : category : music software plugin architectures digital audio editor modular synthesizer music sequencer digital audio workstation sound module synthesizer synthfont timidity++ video game music list of music software

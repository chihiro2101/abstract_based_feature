thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to the leaves are alternate , simple , broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin the flowers are produced in racemes known as '' strigs '' up to long containing ten to twenty flowers , each about in diameter the flowers open in succession from the base of the strig and are mostly pollination , but some pollen is distributed by the wind a pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive if fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely an established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year in the uk , young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots newly planted bushes should be pruned severely , cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level this gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit the remaining branches should be thinned to remove old unproductive wood and to encourage new shoots when harvesting by machine , plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged these move continually down the rows , straddling a row of bushes , shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit thumb ribes plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests reversion is a serious disease transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite cecidophyopsis ribis on the blackcurrant , it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves as a result , the blackcurrant was banned in the united states as a disease vector for much of the 20th century , and even after the federal ban was lifted in 1966 , several u.s podosphaera and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips , and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance the blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning , crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem there are many cultivars of blackcurrant in britain the scottish crop research institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country they produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance , especially in the spring , ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus it was cultivated in russia by the 11th century when it was present in monastery gardens and also grown in towns and settlements the addition of blackcurrant to a mix of cider and lager results in '' diesel '' or '' snakebite and black '' available at pubs blackcurrant juice may be combined with whey in an energy drink pfaf plant database — ribes nigrum blackcurrant — characteristics , cultivation , uses

thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive if fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely an established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year plants from northern asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety , ribes nigrum var blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams , or forest soils , as long as their nutrient requirements are met planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring , but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used on a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of and row separations of or more in the uk , young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base a balanced fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of per plant the blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time , some machines have conveyor system which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row it causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in europe but is rarely encountered on other continents symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ( '' big bud '' ) in winter , each housing thousands of microscopic mites white pine blister rust ( cronartium ribicola ) needs two alternate hosts to complete its life cycle the fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year the other host is any of the white pines , in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the north american species that have not co-evolved with the rust podosphaera and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips , and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots , which wilt and die back this was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'ben alder ' and 'ben tirran ' and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance , disease resistance , machine harvesting , fruit quality , nutritional content and fruit flavour varieties producing green fruit , less strongly-flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants , are cultivated in finland , where they are called '' greencurrants '' ( viherherukka ) in poland , the research institute of horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance , fruit quality , adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'titania ' that have a higher yield , better disease resistance , are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting the fruit of blackcurrants when eaten raw has a strong , tart flavour the purée can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes , yogurt , ice cream , desserts , sorbets , and many other sweet dishes macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif , crème de cassis , which in turn is added to white wine to produce a kir or to champagne to make a kir royal the leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye , and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye resulting from its rich content of anthocyanins pfaf plant database — ribes nigrum blackcurrant — characteristics , cultivation , uses

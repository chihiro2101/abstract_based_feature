thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to each flower has a hairy sepal with yellow glands , the five lobes of which are longer than the inconspicuous petals in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive if fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely in midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries , very dark purple in colour , almost black , with glossy skins and persistent calyxes at the apex , each containing many seeds an established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year plants from northern asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety , ribes nigrum var although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring , but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used on a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of and row separations of or more spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots this gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit the remaining branches should be thinned to remove old unproductive wood and to encourage new shoots the blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time , some machines have conveyor system which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ( '' big bud '' ) in winter , each housing thousands of microscopic mites as a result , the blackcurrant was banned in the united states as a disease vector for much of the 20th century , and even after the federal ban was lifted in 1966 , several u.s currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance the blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning , crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem during the 20th century in europe , much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant 's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields they produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance , especially in the spring , ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin , and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the uk climate , the british government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation 's crop increased significantly commercially , most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern europe for the juice and juice concentrate market as a result , currant growing is making a comeback in new york , vermont , connecticut and oregon a '' black ' n ' black '' can be made by adding a small amount of blackcurrant juice to a pint of stout in britain , 95 % of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture ribena ( a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from ribes nigrum ) and similar fruit syrups and juices polyphenol phytochemicals present in the fruit , seeds and leaves , are being investigated for their potential biological activities pfaf plant database — ribes nigrum blackcurrant — characteristics , cultivation , uses

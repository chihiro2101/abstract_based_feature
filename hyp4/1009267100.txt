thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to the leaves are alternate , simple , broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive if fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely in midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries , very dark purple in colour , almost black , with glossy skins and persistent calyxes at the apex , each containing many seeds two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used an annual spring mulch of well rotted manure is ideal and poultry manure can also be used but needs prior composting with straw or other waste vegetable material spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils the blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen , and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots when harvesting by machine , plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged these move continually down the rows , straddling a row of bushes , shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit the blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time , some machines have conveyor system which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market reversion is a serious disease transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite cecidophyopsis ribis white pine blister rust ( cronartium ribicola ) needs two alternate hosts to complete its life cycle the fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year as a result , the blackcurrant was banned in the united states as a disease vector for much of the 20th century , and even after the federal ban was lifted in 1966 , several u.s the blackcurrant sawfly ( nematus ribesii ) lays its eggs on the underside of the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots , stripping off leaf after leaf they produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance , especially in the spring , ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance the cultivar 'ben hope ' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite , and in the same year , 'ben gairn ' became available for gardeners and the pick-your-own market , 'ben sarek ' , 'ben connan ' and 'big ben ' were introduced and have large , sweet berries and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance , disease resistance , machine harvesting , fruit quality , nutritional content and fruit flavour researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry ( ribes grossularia ) , the red currant ( ribes rubrum ) and the flowering currant ( ribes sanguineum ) during world war ii , most fruits rich in vitamin c , such as oranges , became difficult to obtain in the united kingdom commercially , most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern europe for the juice and juice concentrate market the federal ban on growing currants was shifted to the jurisdictions of individual states in 1966 , and was lifted in new york state in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist greg quinn the purée can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes , yogurt , ice cream , desserts , sorbets , and many other sweet dishes in britain , 95 % of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture ribena ( a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from ribes nigrum ) and similar fruit syrups and juices pfaf plant database — ribes nigrum blackcurrant — characteristics , cultivation , uses

thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to the flowers are produced in racemes known as '' strigs '' up to long containing ten to twenty flowers , each about in diameter the flowers open in succession from the base of the strig and are mostly pollination , but some pollen is distributed by the wind in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive if fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely in midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries , very dark purple in colour , almost black , with glossy skins and persistent calyxes at the apex , each containing many seeds an established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year plants from northern asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety , ribes nigrum var blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams , or forest soils , as long as their nutrient requirements are met although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used an annual spring mulch of well rotted manure is ideal and poultry manure can also be used but needs prior composting with straw or other waste vegetable material spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils the blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen , and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually a balanced fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of per plant fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots commercially , most harvesting is done mechanically by straddle harvesters some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market as pest control has limited effectiveness , severely infected bushes should be destroyed on the blackcurrant , it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves the effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable , since other ribes species also host the disease , some are native to north america , and others such as red currants and ribes uva-crispa were never banned currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance in britain the scottish crop research institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country since 1991 , new zealand has become an important centre for research and development , as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop breeding programmes are concentrating on yield , large fruit size , consistency of cropping and upright habit as of 2017 , major cultivation efforts to improve fruit characteristics occurred in scotland , new zealand , and poland however , several statewide bans still exist including maine , new hampshire , virginia , ohio , and massachusetts the fruit of blackcurrants when eaten raw has a strong , tart flavour sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavor and astringent taste in britain , 95 % of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture ribena ( a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from ribes nigrum ) and similar fruit syrups and juices

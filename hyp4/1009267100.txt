thumb ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium-sized shrub , growing to the leaves are alternate , simple , broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin a pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule in warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive if fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely an established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year plants from northern asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety , ribes nigrum var blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams , or forest soils , as long as their nutrient requirements are met two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used on a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of and row separations of or more a balanced fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of per plant fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots the general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting these move continually down the rows , straddling a row of bushes , shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market thumb ribes plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ( '' big bud '' ) in winter , each housing thousands of microscopic mites one host is plants in the genus ribes on the blackcurrant , it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves the fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year podosphaera and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips , and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( drepanopeziza ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance this effort centered mainly in scotland , poland , and new zealand in britain the scottish crop research institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country for gardeners and the pick-your-own market , 'ben sarek ' , 'ben connan ' and 'big ben ' were introduced and have large , sweet berries the fruit of blackcurrants when eaten raw has a strong , tart flavour a '' black ' n ' black '' can be made by adding a small amount of blackcurrant juice to a pint of stout sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavor and astringent taste blackcurrant seed oil is rich in vitamin e and unsaturated fatty acids , including alpha-linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid pfaf plant database — ribes nigrum blackcurrant — characteristics , cultivation , uses

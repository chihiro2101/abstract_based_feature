the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant as with all electromagnetic devices , an mhd accelerator is reversible : if the ambient working fluid is moving relatively to the magnetic field , charge separation induces an voltage that can be harnessed with electrodes : the device then acts as a power source with no moving parts , transforming the kinetic energy of the incoming fluid into electricity , called an mhd generator mhd thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate : conduction devices when a direct current flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes , the magnetic field being steady as induction mhd accelerators are electrodeless , they do not exhibit the common issues related to conduction systems ( especially joule heating , bubbles and redox from electrolysis ) but need much more intense peak magnetic fields to operate since one of the biggest issues with such thrusters is the limited energy available on-board , induction mhd drives have not been developed out of the laboratory the propulsion force results from the pressure distribution on the shell ( as lift on a wing , or how ciliate microorganisms such as paramecium move water around them ) internal flow systems concentrate the mhd interaction in a limited volume , preserving stealth characteristics this mhd submarine operated on batteries delivering power to electrodes and electromagnets , which produced a magnetic field of 0.015 tesla as low-pressure air is naturally ionized at such very high velocities and altitude , it was thought to use the effect of a magnetic field produced by an electromagnet to replace thermal ablative shields by a '' magnetic shield '' it is a field of magnetohydrodynamics also called magnetogasdynamics , magnetoaerodynamics or magnetoplasma aerodynamics , as the working fluid is the air ( a gas instead of a liquid ) ionized to become electrically conductive ( a plasma ) a us program also exists to design a hypersonic mhd bypass system , the hypersonic vehicle electric power system ( hveps ) such studies covers a field of resistive mhd with magnetic reynolds number â‰ª 1 using nonthermal weakly ionized gases , making the development of demonstrators much more difficult to realize than for mhd in liquids mhd propulsion has been considered as the main propulsion system for both marine and space ships since there is no need to produce lift to counter the gravity of earth in water ( due to buoyancy ) nor in space ( due to weightlessness ) , which is ruled out in the case of flight in the atmosphere in the ben bova novel the precipice , the ship where some of the action took place , starpower 1 , built to prove that exploration and mining of the asteroid belt was feasible and potentially profitable , had a magnetohydrodynamic drive mated to a fusion power plant .

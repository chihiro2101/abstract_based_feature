the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant as with all electromagnetic devices , an mhd accelerator is reversible : if the ambient working fluid is moving relatively to the magnetic field , charge separation induces an voltage that can be harnessed with electrodes : the device then acts as a power source with no moving parts , transforming the kinetic energy of the incoming fluid into electricity , called an mhd generator mhd thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate : conduction devices when a direct current flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes , the magnetic field being steady as induction mhd accelerators are electrodeless , they do not exhibit the common issues related to conduction systems ( especially joule heating , bubbles and redox from electrolysis ) but need much more intense peak magnetic fields to operate both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs : internal flow when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a nozzle of tubular or ring-shaped cross-section , the mhd interaction being concentrated within the pipe ( similarly to rocket or jet engines ) external flow when the fluid is accelerated around the whole wetted area of the vehicle , the electromagnetic fields extending around the body of the vehicle this mhd submarine operated on batteries delivering power to electrodes and electromagnets , which produced a magnetic field of 0.015 tesla military research about underwater mhd propulsion included high-speed torpedoes , remotely operated underwater vehicles ( rov ) , autonomous underwater vehicles ( auv ) , up to larger ones such as submarines first studies of the interaction of plasmas with hypersonic speed around vehicles date back to the late 1950s , with the concept of a new kind of thermal protection system for space capsules during high-speed reentry hypersonic ionized flow interacts with the magnetic field , inducing eddy currents in the plasma airflow velocity reduction upstream to feed a scramjet by the use of an mhd generator section combined with an mhd accelerator downstream at the exhaust nozzle , powered by the generator through an mhd bypass system such studies covers a field of resistive mhd with magnetic reynolds number â‰ª 1 using nonthermal weakly ionized gases , making the development of demonstrators much more difficult to realize than for mhd in liquids mhd propulsion has been considered as the main propulsion system for both marine and space ships since there is no need to produce lift to counter the gravity of earth in water ( due to buoyancy ) nor in space ( due to weightlessness ) , which is ruled out in the case of flight in the atmosphere all charged species within the plasma , from positive and negative ions to free electrons , as well as neutral atoms by the effect of collisions , are accelerated in the same direction by the lorentz '' body '' force , which results from the combination of a magnetic field with an orthogonal electric field ( hence the name of '' cross-field accelerator '' ) , these fields not being in the direction of the acceleration

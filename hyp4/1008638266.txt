the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant as with all electromagnetic devices , an mhd accelerator is reversible : if the ambient working fluid is moving relatively to the magnetic field , charge separation induces an voltage that can be harnessed with electrodes : the device then acts as a power source with no moving parts , transforming the kinetic energy of the incoming fluid into electricity , called an mhd generator mhd thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate : conduction devices when a direct current flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes , the magnetic field being steady as induction mhd accelerators are electrodeless , they do not exhibit the common issues related to conduction systems ( especially joule heating , bubbles and redox from electrolysis ) but need much more intense peak magnetic fields to operate since one of the biggest issues with such thrusters is the limited energy available on-board , induction mhd drives have not been developed out of the laboratory both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs : internal flow when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a nozzle of tubular or ring-shaped cross-section , the mhd interaction being concentrated within the pipe ( similarly to rocket or jet engines ) external flow when the fluid is accelerated around the whole wetted area of the vehicle , the electromagnetic fields extending around the body of the vehicle the first prototype , a 3-meter ( 10-feet ) long submarine called ems-1 , was designed and tested in 1966 by stewart way , a professor of mechanical engineering at the university of california , santa barbara this mhd submarine operated on batteries delivering power to electrodes and electromagnets , which produced a magnetic field of 0.015 tesla as low-pressure air is naturally ionized at such very high velocities and altitude , it was thought to use the effect of a magnetic field produced by an electromagnet to replace thermal ablative shields by a '' magnetic shield '' mhd propulsion has been considered as the main propulsion system for both marine and space ships since there is no need to produce lift to counter the gravity of earth in water ( due to buoyancy ) nor in space ( due to weightlessness ) , which is ruled out in the case of flight in the atmosphere in order to maximize such pressure difference between the two opposite sides , and since the most efficient mhd converters ( with a high hall effect ) are disk-shaped , such mhd aircraft would be preferably flattened to take the shape of a biconvex lens having no wings nor airbreathing jet engines , it would share no similarities with conventional aircraft , but it would behave like a helicopter whose rotor blades would have been replaced by a '' purely electromagnetic rotor '' with no moving part , sucking the air downward all charged species within the plasma , from positive and negative ions to free electrons , as well as neutral atoms by the effect of collisions , are accelerated in the same direction by the lorentz '' body '' force , which results from the combination of a magnetic field with an orthogonal electric field ( hence the name of '' cross-field accelerator '' ) , these fields not being in the direction of the acceleration

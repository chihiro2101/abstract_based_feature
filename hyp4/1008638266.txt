the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field the lorentz force accelerates all charged particles ( positive and negative species ) in the same direction whatever their sign , and the whole fluid is dragged through collisions this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant as with all electromagnetic devices , an mhd accelerator is reversible : if the ambient working fluid is moving relatively to the magnetic field , charge separation induces an voltage that can be harnessed with electrodes : the device then acts as a power source with no moving parts , transforming the kinetic energy of the incoming fluid into electricity , called an mhd generator mhd thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate : conduction devices when a direct current flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes , the magnetic field being steady as induction mhd accelerators are electrodeless , they do not exhibit the common issues related to conduction systems ( especially joule heating , bubbles and redox from electrolysis ) but need much more intense peak magnetic fields to operate both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs : internal flow when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a nozzle of tubular or ring-shaped cross-section , the mhd interaction being concentrated within the pipe ( similarly to rocket or jet engines ) external flow when the fluid is accelerated around the whole wetted area of the vehicle , the electromagnetic fields extending around the body of the vehicle first studies of the interaction of plasmas with hypersonic speed around vehicles date back to the late 1950s , with the concept of a new kind of thermal protection system for space capsules during high-speed reentry active flow control by mhd force fields on the contrary involves a direct and imperious action of forces to locally accelerate or slow down the airflow , modifying its velocity , direction , pressure , friction , heat flux parameters , in order to preserve materials and engines from stress , allowing hypersonic flight it is a field of magnetohydrodynamics also called magnetogasdynamics , magnetoaerodynamics or magnetoplasma aerodynamics , as the working fluid is the air ( a gas instead of a liquid ) ionized to become electrically conductive ( a plasma ) such studies covers a field of resistive mhd with magnetic reynolds number ≪ 1 using nonthermal weakly ionized gases , making the development of demonstrators much more difficult to realize than for mhd in liquids as external flow systems can control the flow over the whole wetted area , limiting thermal issues at high speeds , ambient air would be ionized and radially accelerated by lorentz forces around an axisymmetric body ( shaped as a cylinder , a cone , a sphere… ) , the entire airframe being the engine in order to maximize such pressure difference between the two opposite sides , and since the most efficient mhd converters ( with a high hall effect ) are disk-shaped , such mhd aircraft would be preferably flattened to take the shape of a biconvex lens all charged species within the plasma , from positive and negative ions to free electrons , as well as neutral atoms by the effect of collisions , are accelerated in the same direction by the lorentz '' body '' force , which results from the combination of a magnetic field with an orthogonal electric field ( hence the name of '' cross-field accelerator '' ) , these fields not being in the direction of the acceleration

the working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive fluid ( which can be a liquid or an ionized gas called a plasma ) by the lorentz force , resulting from the cross product of an electric current ( motion of charge carriers accelerated by an electric field applied between two electrodes ) with a perpendicular magnetic field this is the same working principle as an electric motor ( more exactly a linear motor ) except that in an mhd drive , the solid moving rotor is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the propellant as with all electromagnetic devices , an mhd accelerator is reversible : if the ambient working fluid is moving relatively to the magnetic field , charge separation induces an voltage that can be harnessed with electrodes : the device then acts as a power source with no moving parts , transforming the kinetic energy of the incoming fluid into electricity , called an mhd generator mhd thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate : conduction devices when a direct current flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes , the magnetic field being steady as induction mhd accelerators are electrodeless , they do not exhibit the common issues related to conduction systems ( especially joule heating , bubbles and redox from electrolysis ) but need much more intense peak magnetic fields to operate both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs : internal flow when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a nozzle of tubular or ring-shaped cross-section , the mhd interaction being concentrated within the pipe ( similarly to rocket or jet engines ) external flow when the fluid is accelerated around the whole wetted area of the vehicle , the electromagnetic fields extending around the body of the vehicle first studies of the interaction of plasmas with hypersonic speed around vehicles date back to the late 1950s , with the concept of a new kind of thermal protection system for space capsules during high-speed reentry as low-pressure air is naturally ionized at such very high velocities and altitude , it was thought to use the effect of a magnetic field produced by an electromagnet to replace thermal ablative shields by a '' magnetic shield '' hypersonic ionized flow interacts with the magnetic field , inducing eddy currents in the plasma it is a field of magnetohydrodynamics also called magnetogasdynamics , magnetoaerodynamics or magnetoplasma aerodynamics , as the working fluid is the air ( a gas instead of a liquid ) ionized to become electrically conductive ( a plasma ) a us program also exists to design a hypersonic mhd bypass system , the hypersonic vehicle electric power system ( hveps ) such studies covers a field of resistive mhd with magnetic reynolds number â‰ª 1 using nonthermal weakly ionized gases , making the development of demonstrators much more difficult to realize than for mhd in liquids in order to maximize such pressure difference between the two opposite sides , and since the most efficient mhd converters ( with a high hall effect ) are disk-shaped , such mhd aircraft would be preferably flattened to take the shape of a biconvex lens this is a fundamental difference with ion thrusters which rely on electrostatics to accelerate only positive ions using the coulomb force along a high voltage electric field

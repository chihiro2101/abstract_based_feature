decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio the setting up of the decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio occurred within the context of the two-hundred-year conflict of the orders between the patrician order ( the aristocracy ) and the plebeian order ( the commoners ) the form of labour exploitation during this archaic period was the nexum , which was what historians call debt bondage , bonded labour , or debt slavery defaulting debtors were liable to have their labour bonded for life , the beginnings of rome , p because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures , the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and , sometimes , sell them as slaves this led to the first secessio plebis ( 494 bc ) , which was the start of the conflict of the orders the plebeians demanded that the state protect small farmers from the abuse of defaulting debtors by the creditors , who were the wealthy patrician landowners at that time the roman army was a part-time militia of peasant farmers who were drafted each year for the military campaigning season and then went back to their farms when their demands were not met , on their return from a defensive military campaign the soldiers refused to obey orders and seceded to mons sacer , outside rome , the beginnings of rome , pp they used it for actions they judged inequitable or abusive to any plebeian an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) livy said '' two states had been created out of one ; each faction had its own magistrates officials , its own laws '' livy , the history of rome , 2.44.9 the main role of the plebeian institutions in the early days of the conflict of the orders was self-defence ) , chapter 7 , from protection and decense to offense and participation : stages in the conflict of the orders the next step in the conflict was the lex terentilia proposed by terentilius , a plebeian tribune , in 462 & nbsp ; bc with the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the republic , the powers of the king were transferred to the consuls , who were regarded as the representatives of regal power polybius , histories , 6.11 , cicero , on the laws , 3.3 as such , consular powers were undefined and therefore without limits gaius terentilus wanted to have them defined , and therefore curtailed , as a way of proving further protections for the plebeians livy , the history of rome , 3.32 the patricians replied that this was worthy of consideration , but said that only patricians could legislate in 452 & nbsp ; bc the envoys “ returned with the laws of athens it was agreed to appoint decemviri with consular powers which would not be subject to appeal and to suspend both the consulship and the plebeian tribunate after a long debate about whether plebeians should sit on the decemvirate , the plebeian tribunes agreed to a patrician-only panel in exchange for a law they had passed not being repealed in compensation for their loss of office , appius claudius and titus genucius were appointed to the decemviri their rule was fair and their administration of justice was exemplary they were approved by the higher popular assembly , the assembly of the soldiers there was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all roman law all the ten men had twelve lictors and their fasces had axes ( even though the carrying of weapons within the city walls was forbidden ) when they issued the two additional tables there was no longer any justification for their rule and people looked forward to elections according to livy , the decemviri summoned the senate , but the senators did not show up to the plebeians this showed the illegitimacy of the decemviri as their term had expired and were now meant to be just private citizens in the end they allowed its proclamation of the levy in silence because they feared a popular uprising would bolster the plebeian tribunes , their political adversaries as they were not good military men , both armies were routed the claimant said that the girl was born at his house and then he palmed her off to verginius as his , but that she still was his slave verginia 's lover , icilius , arrived at the forum , but was stopped by a lictor verginia 's supporters sent a relative and icilius ' brother to quickly go to verginius ' military camp the claimant pressed icilius to pay surety to be verginia 's guarantor many people offered money and verginia was bailed to her family appius claudius upheld the fabricated case of the claimant and adjudged verginia to him without even listening to verginius according to livy , verginius stabbed his daughter to death saying that that was the only way he could assert her freedom appius claudius ordered his arrest , but the crowd protected him as he made his way to the city gate verginius , who had been followed by nearly four hundred men , caused an even bigger stir with the soldiers than in the city it sent three envoys to inquire who had seized the aventine , who their leaders were and what they wanted verginius proposed the election of ten leaders to be given the military title , military tribune on their way through the city they were joined by civilian plebeians so does the second decemvirate 's attempt to prolong its office by pretending that they were still working on the final two tables ” he also notes that the tradition of two decemvirates and the division of the tables into groups of ten and two were already around in the mid-second century bc the decemviri agris dandis adsignandis was appointed from time to time to control the distribution of public lands ( ager publicus )

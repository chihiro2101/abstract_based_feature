decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio the setting up of the decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio occurred within the context of the two-hundred-year conflict of the orders between the patrician order ( the aristocracy ) and the plebeian order ( the commoners ) because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures , the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and , sometimes , sell them as slaves this led to the first secessio plebis ( 494 bc ) , which was the start of the conflict of the orders the plebeians demanded that the state protect small farmers from the abuse of defaulting debtors by the creditors , who were the wealthy patrician landowners when their demands were not met , on their return from a defensive military campaign the soldiers refused to obey orders and seceded to mons sacer , outside rome rather , they obtained the recognition of the institutions which they had created during the rebellion , the plebeian council ( an assembly restricted to plebeians where they could debate their issues ) cornell , the beginnings of rome , pp & nbsp ; 260–262 and the plebeian tribune they also convened and presided over the plebeian council and presented bills for its vote an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) polybius , histories , 6.11 , cicero , on the laws , 3.3 as such , consular powers were undefined and therefore without limits gaius terentilus wanted to have them defined , and therefore curtailed , as a way of proving further protections for the plebeians the patricians were opposed to this curtailment and managed to postpone the debate on this law for eight years in 454 & nbsp ; bc the plebeian tribunes dropped the fruitless pursuit of this law livy , the history of rome , 3.32 the patricians replied that this was worthy of consideration , but said that only patricians could legislate although disputed by historians such as niebuhr , cornell and grant , according to livy and dionysius , three envoys were sent to athens to study the law of solon and inquire about the laws of other greek city-states ” the plebeian tribunes pressed to begin the compilation of the laws it was agreed to appoint decemviri with consular powers which would not be subject to appeal and to suspend both the consulship and the plebeian tribunate this made the decemvirate an extraordinary magistracy ( a governing body with extraordinary powers ) as well as a commission tasked with compiling laws livy , the history of rome , 3.33 the decemviri took office in 451 & nbsp ; bc both consuls elect , appius claudius crassus and titus genucius augurinus , resigned in compensation for their loss of office , appius claudius and titus genucius were appointed to the decemviri the three envoys were also part of the decemviri livy , the history of rome , 3.33.3-5 the most influential member was appius claudius who , according to livy , '' was the guiding hand in the whole magistracy they were approved by the higher popular assembly , the assembly of the soldiers there was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all roman law all the ten men had twelve lictors and their fasces had axes ( even though the carrying of weapons within the city walls was forbidden ) livy , 3.3.35-38.1-2 a sabine army attacked roman territory and encamped there and an aequi army attacked an ally of rome according to livy , the decemviri summoned the senate , but the senators did not show up however , it turned out that the senators had left and gone to their farms , supposedly in disgust some of the decemviri led two armies against the two enemies as they were not good military men , both armies were routed livy , 3.3.38-42 according to livy , appius claudius had his eyes on verginia , the daughter of a plebeian , lucius verginius , who was a centurion absent from rome with the army she was dragged off her feet in the forum and the shouts of her nurses attracted a crowd verginia 's friends asked for an adjournment until verginius could attend and to leave verginia in the custody of the defendants appius claudius agreed to summon verginius , but put verginia in the custody of the claimant verginia 's supporters sent a relative and icilius ' brother to quickly go to verginius ' military camp appius claudius upheld the fabricated case of the claimant and adjudged verginia to him without even listening to verginius appius claudius claimed that he knew that there had been seditious meetings and told verginius to be quiet and the lictors to seize the slave ( verginia ) as a result , the crowd talked about restoring the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal according to livy , appius claudius ordered the arrest of icilius , but the crowd prevented this the crowd booed the former and listened only to the latter two , who ordered the lictors to back off the latter said that they would do so only after the enactment of the two tables of laws for which they were elected the first law provided that the resolutions of the plebeian council were binding on the people 296 cornell notes that if this was the case the consuls and the plebeian tribunes would have been suspended at the start of the second decemvirate instead of the first ” he also notes that the tradition of two decemvirates and the division of the tables into groups of ten and two were already around in the mid-second century bc the decemviri agris dandis adsignandis was appointed from time to time to control the distribution of public lands ( ager publicus )

decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio the setting up of the decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio occurred within the context of the two-hundred-year conflict of the orders between the patrician order ( the aristocracy ) and the plebeian order ( the commoners ) the form of labour exploitation during this archaic period was the nexum , which was what historians call debt bondage , bonded labour , or debt slavery defaulting debtors were liable to have their labour bonded for life because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures , the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and , sometimes , sell them as slaves the plebeians demanded that the state protect small farmers from the abuse of defaulting debtors by the creditors , who were the wealthy patrician landowners at that time the roman army was a part-time militia of peasant farmers who were drafted each year for the military campaigning season and then went back to their farms however , the plebeian demands were not fully met & nbsp ; 259–260 the latter acted as the defenders of the plebeians from abuse by consuls or officials through the provocatio , the power to veto the actions of the consuls and officials an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) livy said '' two states had been created out of one ; each faction had its own magistrates officials , its own laws '' livy , the history of rome , 2.44.9 the main role of the plebeian institutions in the early days of the conflict of the orders was self-defence the patricians were opposed to this curtailment and managed to postpone the debate on this law for eight years although disputed by historians such as niebuhr , cornell and grant , according to livy and dionysius , three envoys were sent to athens to study the law of solon and inquire about the laws of other greek city-states in 452 & nbsp ; bc the envoys “ returned with the laws of athens ” the plebeian tribunes pressed to begin the compilation of the laws the decemviri took office in 451 & nbsp ; bc both consuls elect , appius claudius crassus and titus genucius augurinus , resigned the three envoys were also part of the decemviri livy , the history of rome , 3.33.3-5 the most influential member was appius claudius who , according to livy , '' was the guiding hand in the whole magistracy they drafted their laws on ten bronze tables and presented them to the people , asked for feedback and amended them accordingly there was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all roman law according to livy , appius claudius rigged the election and announced the election of himself and nine men who were his supporters this new decemvirate became tyrannical all the ten men had twelve lictors and their fasces had axes ( even though the carrying of weapons within the city walls was forbidden ) livy , 3.3.35-38.1-2 a sabine army attacked roman territory and encamped there and an aequi army attacked an ally of rome according to livy , the decemviri summoned the senate , but the senators did not show up to the plebeians this showed the illegitimacy of the decemviri as their term had expired and were now meant to be just private citizens the plebeians saw this as a betrayal of liberty however , the senators denounced the decemviri and tried to oppose them , called them private citizens and refused to call a levy livy , 3.3.38-42 according to livy , appius claudius had his eyes on verginia , the daughter of a plebeian , lucius verginius , who was a centurion absent from rome with the army having failed to woo her with money and promises , appius claudius decided to seize this opportunity to get one of his men to claim her as her slave verginia 's friends asked for an adjournment until verginius could attend and to leave verginia in the custody of the defendants appius claudius agreed to summon verginius , but put verginia in the custody of the claimant verginia 's lover , icilius , arrived at the forum , but was stopped by a lictor the claimant pressed icilius to pay surety to be verginia 's guarantor at dawn a crowd was waiting to see what would happen appius claudius upheld the fabricated case of the claimant and adjudged verginia to him without even listening to verginius according to livy , appius claudius ordered the arrest of icilius , but the crowd prevented this the senators were hostile to the decemviri and there was hope that they would bring them down however , the senators were concerned that the arrival of verginius at the military camp would cause unrest and sent messengers to tell the commanders to keep the troops from mutiny livy , 3.52 lucius valerius and marcus horatius were sent to negotiate terms with the plebeians at their discretion they also introduced the practice of delivering the decrees of the senate to the aediles at the temple of ceres , “ up to that time they were wont to be suppressed or falsified , at the pleasure of the consuls moreover , that the second decemvirate was elected because it was felt that two new tables were needed implies that the decemvirate was meant to be a temporary body for the duration of the drawing up of the laws if this was the case , the fact that livy seemed to suggest that only patricians sat on the first decemvirate would be a contradiction if it had gone to athens , by that time the law of solon would have been replaced by the radical reforms of pericles in the first half of the 5th century bc cornell notes that the fragments of the law of the twelve tables show many signs of greek influence and even some greek loan-words the decemviri agris dandis adsignandis was appointed from time to time to control the distribution of public lands ( ager publicus )

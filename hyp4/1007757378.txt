decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio the setting up of the decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio occurred within the context of the two-hundred-year conflict of the orders between the patrician order ( the aristocracy ) and the plebeian order ( the commoners ) the debtor pledged his labour services as collateral for debt because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures , the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and , sometimes , sell them as slaves this led to the first secessio plebis ( 494 bc ) , which was the start of the conflict of the orders the plebeians demanded that the state protect small farmers from the abuse of defaulting debtors by the creditors , who were the wealthy patrician landowners when their demands were not met , on their return from a defensive military campaign the soldiers refused to obey orders and seceded to mons sacer , outside rome they also convened and presided over the plebeian council and presented bills for its vote an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) '' livy , the history of rome , 2.44.9 the main role of the plebeian institutions in the early days of the conflict of the orders was self-defence the patricians were opposed to this curtailment and managed to postpone the debate on this law for eight years in 454 & nbsp ; bc the plebeian tribunes dropped the fruitless pursuit of this law they asked the senate to “ consent to the appointment of a body of legislators , chosen in equal numbers from plebeians and patricians to enact what would be useful to both orders and secure equal liberty for each ” in 452 & nbsp ; bc the envoys “ returned with the laws of athens ” the plebeian tribunes pressed to begin the compilation of the laws it was agreed to appoint decemviri with consular powers which would not be subject to appeal and to suspend both the consulship and the plebeian tribunate this made the decemvirate an extraordinary magistracy ( a governing body with extraordinary powers ) as well as a commission tasked with compiling laws in compensation for their loss of office , appius claudius and titus genucius were appointed to the decemviri thanks to the favour of the plebs '' livy , the history of rome , 3.33.7 each day a different decemvir presided over the magistracy and this man had the twelve lictors ( the bodyguards of the consuls ) with fasces ( bound bundles of rods which were the symbol of supreme authority and sometimes had axes ) despite not being subject to appeal , they yielded to one another when an appeal was taken they drafted their laws on ten bronze tables and presented them to the people , asked for feedback and amended them accordingly there was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all roman law many men canvassed for election to the second decemvirate according to livy , appius claudius rigged the election and announced the election of himself and nine men who were his supporters livy , 3.3.35-38.1-2 a sabine army attacked roman territory and encamped there and an aequi army attacked an ally of rome according to livy , the decemviri summoned the senate , but the senators did not show up to the plebeians this showed the illegitimacy of the decemviri as their term had expired and were now meant to be just private citizens in the end they allowed its proclamation of the levy in silence because they feared a popular uprising would bolster the plebeian tribunes , their political adversaries some of the decemviri led two armies against the two enemies verginia went to court followed by her friends and acquaintances verginia 's friends asked for an adjournment until verginius could attend and to leave verginia in the custody of the defendants appius claudius agreed to summon verginius , but put verginia in the custody of the claimant the claimant pressed icilius to pay surety to be verginia 's guarantor at dawn a crowd was waiting to see what would happen appius claudius upheld the fabricated case of the claimant and adjudged verginia to him without even listening to verginius when the claimant made his way to take her , verginius shouted that he had betrothed verginia to icilius , not to appius claudius , and that he did not bring her up for dishonour appius claudius claimed that he knew that there had been seditious meetings and told verginius to be quiet and the lictors to seize the slave ( verginia ) the senators were hostile to the decemviri and there was hope that they would bring them down however , the senators were concerned that the arrival of verginius at the military camp would cause unrest and sent messengers to tell the commanders to keep the troops from mutiny verginius , who had been followed by nearly four hundred men , caused an even bigger stir with the soldiers than in the city '' the civilians who had come with verginius to the military camp claimed that the decemviri had been overthrown and that appius claudius had gone into exile and incited the soldiers to rise up livy , 3.49-50 these soldiers , who were from the army which had been sent against the aequi , marched to rome and took possession of the aventine hill it sent three envoys to inquire who had seized the aventine , who their leaders were and what they wanted verginius pardoned him for the crimes he had committed over two years saying '' i shall not suffer him to add to his other crimes the impudence of defending himself '' if this was the case , the fact that livy seemed to suggest that only patricians sat on the first decemvirate would be a contradiction ” he also notes that the tradition of two decemvirates and the division of the tables into groups of ten and two were already around in the mid-second century bc he also points out that according to an alternative tradition the decemviri were advised by hermodorus of ephesus , a greek philosopher in exile

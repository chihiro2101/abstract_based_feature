this led to the first secessio plebis ( 494 bc ) , which was the start of the conflict of the orders when this was not forthcoming , they resorted to boycotting the military levy at that time the roman army was a part-time militia of peasant farmers who were drafted each year for the military campaigning season and then went back to their farms refusing the call-up gave plebeians significant political leverage when their demands were not met , on their return from a defensive military campaign the soldiers refused to obey orders and seceded to mons sacer , outside rome rather , they obtained the recognition of the institutions which they had created during the rebellion , the plebeian council ( an assembly restricted to plebeians where they could debate their issues ) cornell , the beginnings of rome , pp & nbsp ; 259–260 the latter acted as the defenders of the plebeians from abuse by consuls or officials through the provocatio , the power to veto the actions of the consuls and officials an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) livy said '' two states had been created out of one ; each faction had its own magistrates officials , its own laws it provided for a five-man commission to set out the norms through which the power of the consuls would be defined the patricians were opposed to this curtailment and managed to postpone the debate on this law for eight years in 454 & nbsp ; bc the plebeian tribunes dropped the fruitless pursuit of this law livy , the history of rome , 3.32 the patricians replied that this was worthy of consideration , but said that only patricians could legislate in 452 & nbsp ; bc the envoys “ returned with the laws of athens it was agreed to appoint decemviri with consular powers which would not be subject to appeal and to suspend both the consulship and the plebeian tribunate after a long debate about whether plebeians should sit on the decemvirate , the plebeian tribunes agreed to a patrician-only panel in exchange for a law they had passed not being repealed livy , the history of rome , 3.33 the decemviri took office in 451 & nbsp ; bc both consuls elect , appius claudius crassus and titus genucius augurinus , resigned so did the other magistrates and the plebeian tribunes in compensation for their loss of office , appius claudius and titus genucius were appointed to the decemviri the three envoys were also part of the decemviri they drafted their laws on ten bronze tables and presented them to the people , asked for feedback and amended them accordingly many men canvassed for election to the second decemvirate according to livy , the decemviri summoned the senate , but the senators did not show up to the plebeians this showed the illegitimacy of the decemviri as their term had expired and were now meant to be just private citizens in the end they allowed its proclamation of the levy in silence because they feared a popular uprising would bolster the plebeian tribunes , their political adversaries livy , 3.3.38-42 according to livy , appius claudius had his eyes on verginia , the daughter of a plebeian , lucius verginius , who was a centurion absent from rome with the army verginia 's friends asked for an adjournment until verginius could attend and to leave verginia in the custody of the defendants appius claudius agreed to summon verginius , but put verginia in the custody of the claimant he pleaded his case loudly and attracted the attention of the crowd verginia 's supporters sent a relative and icilius ' brother to quickly go to verginius ' military camp the claimant pressed icilius to pay surety to be verginia 's guarantor many people offered money and verginia was bailed to her family appius claudius wrote to his colleagues at the camp not to grant verginius leave and to arrest him at dawn a crowd was waiting to see what would happen appius claudius upheld the fabricated case of the claimant and adjudged verginia to him without even listening to verginius according to livy , verginius stabbed his daughter to death saying that that was the only way he could assert her freedom appius claudius ordered his arrest , but the crowd protected him as he made his way to the city gate as a result , the crowd talked about restoring the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal according to livy , appius claudius ordered the arrest of icilius , but the crowd prevented this '' appius claudius , lucius valerius , and marcus horatius made speeches another decemvir , not knowing what to do , ended up summoning the senate the senators were hostile to the decemviri and there was hope that they would bring them down the senate decreed the abdication of the decemviri , the election of the plebeian tribunes and the mentioned immunity lucius valerius potitius and marcus horatius barbatus were elected as consuls genucius , who had a plebeian name , have led some historians to reject both that this man was a decemvir and the existence of a second decemvirate , which they see as fiction he also points out that according to an alternative tradition the decemviri were advised by hermodorus of ephesus , a greek philosopher in exile

decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio the setting up of the decemviri legibus scribundis consulari imperio occurred within the context of the two-hundred-year conflict of the orders between the patrician order ( the aristocracy ) and the plebeian order ( the commoners ) the form of labour exploitation during this archaic period was the nexum , which was what historians call debt bondage , bonded labour , or debt slavery this also led to an increase in the problem of the abuse of defaulting debtors because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures , the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and , sometimes , sell them as slaves the plebeians demanded that the state protect small farmers from the abuse of defaulting debtors by the creditors , who were the wealthy patrician landowners at that time the roman army was a part-time militia of peasant farmers who were drafted each year for the military campaigning season and then went back to their farms however , the plebeian demands were not fully met & nbsp ; 259–260 the latter acted as the defenders of the plebeians from abuse by consuls or officials through the provocatio , the power to veto the actions of the consuls and officials an element of this conflict was about whether the resolutions of this council should be binding on all roman citizens , including the patricians , or only on the plebeians the plebeian institutions were parallel and separate from that of the roman state ( the consuls , the senate and the two other popular assemblies ) livy said '' two states had been created out of one ; each faction had its own magistrates officials , its own laws '' livy , the history of rome , 2.44.9 the main role of the plebeian institutions in the early days of the conflict of the orders was self-defence it provided for a five-man commission to set out the norms through which the power of the consuls would be defined the patricians were opposed to this curtailment and managed to postpone the debate on this law for eight years livy , the history of rome , 3.32 the patricians replied that this was worthy of consideration , but said that only patricians could legislate in 452 & nbsp ; bc the envoys “ returned with the laws of athens it was agreed to appoint decemviri with consular powers which would not be subject to appeal and to suspend both the consulship and the plebeian tribunate livy , the history of rome , 3.33 in compensation for their loss of office , appius claudius and titus genucius were appointed to the decemviri the three envoys were also part of the decemviri livy , the history of rome , 3.33.3-5 the most influential member was appius claudius who , according to livy , '' was the guiding hand in the whole magistracy there was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all roman law it was decided to elect a new decemvirate according to livy , appius claudius rigged the election and announced the election of himself and nine men who were his supporters all the ten men had twelve lictors and their fasces had axes ( even though the carrying of weapons within the city walls was forbidden ) they conducted trials behind closed doors and issued arbitrary judgements to the plebeians this showed the illegitimacy of the decemviri as their term had expired and were now meant to be just private citizens however , the senators denounced the decemviri and tried to oppose them , called them private citizens and refused to call a levy some of the decemviri led two armies against the two enemies as they were not good military men , both armies were routed livy , 3.3.38-42 according to livy , appius claudius had his eyes on verginia , the daughter of a plebeian , lucius verginius , who was a centurion absent from rome with the army having failed to woo her with money and promises , appius claudius decided to seize this opportunity to get one of his men to claim her as her slave verginia went to court followed by her friends and acquaintances the claimant said that the girl was born at his house and then he palmed her off to verginius as his , but that she still was his slave verginia 's friends asked for an adjournment until verginius could attend and to leave verginia in the custody of the defendants appius claudius agreed to summon verginius , but put verginia in the custody of the claimant according to livy , verginius stabbed his daughter to death saying that that was the only way he could assert her freedom appius claudius ordered his arrest , but the crowd protected him as he made his way to the city gate as a result , the crowd talked about restoring the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal however , the senators were concerned that the arrival of verginius at the military camp would cause unrest and sent messengers to tell the commanders to keep the troops from mutiny livy , 3.49-50 these soldiers , who were from the army which had been sent against the aequi , marched to rome and took possession of the aventine hill the civilian crowd shouted that they wanted lucius valerius and marcus horatius to be the envoys they decided to send valerius and horatius to the aventine on the condition that the decemviri resign some senators , including valerius and horatius , argued that their restoration was needed in order to both get rid of the decemviri and restore patrician magistrates they demanded the recovery of the protections the plebeians enjoyed through the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal , immunity for those who incited the rebellion and harsh punishment for the decemviri the envoys agreed on the first three demands and asked that the issue of punishment be postponed this bad law was fictively ascribed to a second body of bad decemvirs ” they were similar to the names of the consuls for 509 bc , the year of the establishment of the roman republic ( publius valerius publicola and marcus horatius pulvillus )

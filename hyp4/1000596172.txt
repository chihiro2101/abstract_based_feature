persuasive technologies can be categorized by their functional roles fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors – or as more than one at once fogg1998 as tools , technologies can increase people 's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it fogg2002 for example , an wizard ( software ) can influence task completion – including completing tasks not planned by users ( such as installation of additional software ) as media , interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior , empathizing , or exploring causal relationships fogg2002 for example , simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade ; these use procedural rhetoric technologies can also function as social actors persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role : oinas-kukkonen_harjumaa2008 do they persuade , for example , through human-computer interaction ( hci ) or computer-mediated communication ( cmc ) ? the examples already mentioned are the former , but there are many of the latter communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction , licklider1968 bailenson2004 providing shared feedback on interaction , dimicco2004 or restructuring communication processes by connecting a user with other users , his/her coworkers , friends and families , a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes halko and & nbsp ; kientz made an extensive search in the literature for persuasive strategies and methods used in the field of psychology to modify health-related behaviors this persuades the technology user through an authoritative agent , for example , a strict personal trainer who instructs the user to perform the task that will meet their goal for example , when a conversational agent persuades a user using social influence strategies , the user can not also use similar strategies on the agent while persuasive technologies are found in many domains , considerable recent attention has focused on behavior change in health domains digital health coaching is the utilization of computers as persuasive technology to augment the personal care delivered to patients , and is used in numerous medical settings even though the healthcare discipline has produced a plethora of empirical behavior change research , other scientific disciplines are also adapting such theories to induce behavior change '' another ethical challenge for persuasive technology designers is the risk of triggering persuasive backfires , where the technology triggers the bad behavior that it was designed to reduce

fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors – or as more than one at once fogg1998 as tools , technologies can increase people 's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it fogg2002 for example , an wizard ( software ) can influence task completion – including completing tasks not planned by users ( such as installation of additional software ) as media , interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior , empathizing , or exploring causal relationships fogg2002 for example , simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade ; these use procedural rhetoric fogg2002 interactive technologies can cue social responses , e.g communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction , licklider1968 bailenson2004 providing shared feedback on interaction , dimicco2004 or restructuring communication processes persuasion design is the design of messages by analyzing and evaluating their content , using established psychological research theories and methods by connecting a user with other users , his/her coworkers , friends and families , a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes halko and & nbsp ; kientz made an extensive search in the literature for persuasive strategies and methods used in the field of psychology to modify health-related behaviors this persuades the technology user through an authoritative agent , for example , a strict personal trainer who instructs the user to perform the task that will meet their goal elton2007 numerous scientific studies show that online health behaviour change interventions can influence users ' behaviours to make behavior change strategies more effective , researchers also have been adapting well-known and empirically-tested behavior change theories into such practice even though the healthcare discipline has produced a plethora of empirical behavior change research , other scientific disciplines are also adapting such theories to induce behavior change besides the environmental benefits such as co2 savings , health benefit , cost are also often used to promote eco-friendly behaviors persuasive technologies developed relies on self-report or automated systems that monitor human behavior using sensors and pattern recognition algorithms '' another ethical challenge for persuasive technology designers is the risk of triggering persuasive backfires , where the technology triggers the bad behavior that it was designed to reduce

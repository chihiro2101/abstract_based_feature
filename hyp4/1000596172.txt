fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors – or as more than one at once fogg1998 as tools , technologies can increase people 's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it fogg2002 for example , an wizard ( software ) can influence task completion – including completing tasks not planned by users ( such as installation of additional software ) as media , interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior , empathizing , or exploring causal relationships persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role : oinas-kukkonen_harjumaa2008 do they persuade , for example , through human-computer interaction ( hci ) or computer-mediated communication ( cmc ) ? the examples already mentioned are the former , but there are many of the latter communication technologies can persuade or amplify the persuasion of others by transforming the social interaction , licklider1968 bailenson2004 providing shared feedback on interaction , dimicco2004 or restructuring communication processes previous research has also utilized on social motivators like competition for persuasion by connecting a user with other users , his/her coworkers , friends and families , a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes it has been demonstrated that social impact can result in greater behavior changes than the case where the user is isolated their search concluded that there are eight main types of persuasive strategies , which can be grouped into the following four categories , where each category has two complementary approaches this persuades the technology user through an authoritative agent , for example , a strict personal trainer who instructs the user to perform the task that will meet their goal this persuades the user through a neutral agent , for example , a friend who encourages the user to meet their goals for example , when a conversational agent persuades a user using social influence strategies , the user can not also use similar strategies on the agent to make behavior change strategies more effective , researchers also have been adapting well-known and empirically-tested behavior change theories into such practice is that even though people who have maintained behavior change for short term might revert to baseline , their perception of their behavior change could be different : they still believe they maintained the behavior change even if they factually have not this result has encouraged researchers to develop persuasive technologies to promote for example , green travels , less waste , etc '' another ethical challenge for persuasive technology designers is the risk of triggering persuasive backfires , where the technology triggers the bad behavior that it was designed to reduce

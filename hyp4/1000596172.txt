fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors – or as more than one at once fogg1998 as tools , technologies can increase people 's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it fogg2002 for example , an wizard ( software ) can influence task completion – including completing tasks not planned by users ( such as installation of additional software ) as media , interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior , empathizing , or exploring causal relationships fogg2002 for example , simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade ; these use procedural rhetoric technologies can also function as social actors fogg2002 interactive technologies can cue social responses , e.g persuasive technologies can also be categorized by whether they change attitude and behaviors through direct interaction or through a mediating role : oinas-kukkonen_harjumaa2008 do they persuade , for example , through human-computer interaction ( hci ) or computer-mediated communication ( cmc ) ? the examples already mentioned are the former , but there are many of the latter persuasion design is the design of messages by analyzing and evaluating their content , using established psychological research theories and methods by connecting a user with other users , his/her coworkers , friends and families , a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes it has been demonstrated that social impact can result in greater behavior changes than the case where the user is isolated the most prominent behavior change theories that have been implemented in various health-related behavior change research has been self-determination theory , theory of planned behavior , social cognitive theory , transtheoretical model , and social ecological model the effectiveness of them vary : social cognitive theory proposed by bandura , which incorporates the well-known construct of self-efficacy , has been the most widely used method in behavior change interventions as well as the most effective in maintaining long-term behavior change even though the healthcare discipline has produced a plethora of empirical behavior change research , other scientific disciplines are also adapting such theories to induce behavior change this result has encouraged researchers to develop persuasive technologies to promote for example , green travels , less waste , etc persuasive technologies developed relies on self-report or automated systems that monitor human behavior using sensors and pattern recognition algorithms '' another ethical challenge for persuasive technology designers is the risk of triggering persuasive backfires , where the technology triggers the bad behavior that it was designed to reduce

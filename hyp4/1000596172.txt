fogg proposes the functional triad as a classification of three '' basic ways that people view or respond to computing technologies '' : persuasive technologies can function as tools , media , or social actors â€“ or as more than one at once fogg1998 as tools , technologies can increase people 's ability to perform a target behavior by making it easier or restructuring it as media , interactive technologies can use both interactivity and narrative to create persuasive experiences that support rehearsing a behavior , empathizing , or exploring causal relationships fogg2002 for example , simulations and games instantiate rules and procedures that express a point of view and can shape behavior and persuade ; these use procedural rhetoric previous research has also utilized on social motivators like competition for persuasion by connecting a user with other users , his/her coworkers , friends and families , a persuasive application can apply social motivators on the user to promote behavior changes this persuades the technology user through an authoritative agent , for example , a strict personal trainer who instructs the user to perform the task that will meet their goal this persuades the user through a neutral agent , for example , a friend who encourages the user to meet their goals this persuades the user through the notion of cooperating and teamwork , such as allowing the user to team up with friends to complete their goals for example , users can play against friends or peers and be motivated to achieve their goal by winning the competition this persuades the user through external motivators , for example , winning a trophy as a reward for completing a task for example , when a conversational agent persuades a user using social influence strategies , the user can not also use similar strategies on the agent to make behavior change strategies more effective , researchers also have been adapting well-known and empirically-tested behavior change theories into such practice each behavior change theory analyses behavior change in different ways and consider different factors to be more or less important is that even though people who have maintained behavior change for short term might revert to baseline , their perception of their behavior change could be different : they still believe they maintained the behavior change even if they factually have not second , knowledge about persuasive computers helps people recognize when technologies are using tactics to persuade them persuasive backfiring : when behavior change interventions trigger unintended negative outcomes

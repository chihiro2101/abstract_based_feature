his early childhood years were spent in oklahoma , before moving with his family to detroit joop visser , '' dexter gordon : settin ' the pace '' , proper records , p23 in 1929 after a very happy year there , he moved to jimmy raschel 's band ( raschel had recorded a few sides earlier in the 1930s but did not do so again ) and then on to the benny carew band in grand rapids , michigan jeri knew earl hines , and when the hines band came through detroit in late 1943 , she persuaded earl to hire wardellâ€”on alto , since there was no tenor vacancy at the time although most of them had left by the time gray joined , playing with the hines band was still a lively and stimulating experience for the young tenor player wardell spent approximately three years with hines , and matured rapidly during this time he soon became a featured soloist , and the band 's recordings show a relaxed , fluent stylist very much in the lester young mold he left hines late in 1946 , settling in los angeles , california ; soon after arriving there , he recorded the first session under his own name the date produced some excellent sides , notably '' easy swing '' and '' the man i love '' ; there is a reissue of the whole session , including alternate takes ( 2 ) , but a selection is available on ( 12 ) in los angeles , wardell worked in a number of bands including benny carter , the blues singer ivory joe hunter , and the small group that supported singer billy eckstine on a tour of the west coast here wardell found his element , playing in the mainly after-hours sessions in clubs such as jack 's basket room , the down beat , lovejoy 's and the club alabam , and his early success in these sessions led ross russell to include him in a studio session he was organising for his dial label gordon later recalled : '' there 'd be a lot of cats on the stand but by the end of the session it would wind up with wardell and myself the success of '' the chase '' was the break that wardell needed , and he became increasingly prominent in public sessions in and around la , including the '' just jazz '' series of jam sessions organised by the disc jockey gene norman apart from a spell with a small band led by al killian ( some jubilee recordings by this group ( 8 ) show wardell in fine form ) wardell was still working mainly in one-off sessions during 1947 there is little sign of bop in the group 's playing , the only noticeable influence being in some of wardell 's phrasing and in aspects of mary lou williams ' arrangements for the band the group was not , however , a financial success and goodman eventually broke it up , but by now wardell was fully established on the east coast as an up-and-coming musician goodman was not an easy employer at the best of times and this , combined with the constant travelling , made wardell increasingly unhappy : recordings of the band , both studio sessions ( 13 ) and live airshots ( 14 , 15 ) , feature work by wardell that is below his own best standards the only drawback to working with basie ( who had by now enlarged his group again to big band size ) was the constant travelling , and wardell eventually decided to leave so that he could enjoy more home life at around this time his recording sessions started becoming fewer & mdash ; though a live session with dexter gordon , recreating the excitements of central avenue , and a studio session with art farmer and hampton hawes ( both on 18 ) , have fine examples of wardell 's playing spotlite spj- ( cd ) 109-2 ( charlie parker : the dial masters ) 2-cd set spotlite spj- ( cd ) 130 ( dexter gordon : dexter gordon on dial - the complete sessions ) giants of jazz cd 53064 ( wardell gray : the chase fresh sound fsr-cd 157 ( wardell gray quintet - live at the haig ) 1952 savoy svy17441 ( 3-cd set ) ( bopland ) 1947

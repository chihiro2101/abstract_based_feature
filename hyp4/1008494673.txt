in the 1960s through the 1970s , paul boyer , a ucla professor , developed the binding change , or flip-flop , mechanism theory , which postulated that atp synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in atp synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit the crystal structure of the f 1 showed alternating alpha and beta subunits ( 3 of each ) , arranged like segments of an orange around a rotating asymmetrical gamma subunit a portion of the f o ( the ring of c-subunits ) rotates as the protons pass through the membrane the structure of the intact atp synthase is currently known at low-resolution from electron cryo-microscopy ( cryo-em ) studies of the complex under the right conditions , the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse , with atp hydrolysis driving proton pump across the membrane finally , the active site cycles back to the open state ( orange ) , releasing atp and binding more adp and phosphate , ready for the next cycle of atp production in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy however , whereas the f-atp synthase generates atp by utilising a proton gradient , the v-atpase generates a proton gradient at the expense of atp , generating ph values of as low as 1 alternatively , the dna helicase/ motor complex may have had pump activity with the atpase activity of the helicase driving the motor in reverse in plants , atp synthase is also present in chloroplasts ( cf 1 f o -atp synthase ) the atp synthase isolated from bovine ( bos taurus ) heart mitochondria is , in terms of biochemistry and structure , the best-characterized atp synthase instead , they synthesize atp using the a-atpase/synthase , a rotary machine structually similar to the v-atpase but mainly functioning as an atp synthase

the f 1 fraction derives its name from the term '' fraction 1 '' and f o ( written as a subscript letter '' o '' , not '' zero '' ) derives its name from being the binding fraction for oligomycin , a type of naturally derived antibiotic that is able to inhibit the f o unit of atp synthase in the 1960s through the 1970s , paul boyer , a ucla professor , developed the binding change , or flip-flop , mechanism theory , which postulated that atp synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in atp synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit according to the current model of atp synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( h+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( h+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the f o region of atp synthase the c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk ( consisting primarily of the gamma subunit ) , causing it to rotate within the alpha 3 beta 3 of f 1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to atp synthesis under the right conditions , the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse , with atp hydrolysis driving proton pump across the membrane the enzyme then undergoes a change in shape and forces these molecules together , with the active site in the resulting '' tight '' state ( shown in red ) binding the newly produced atp molecule with very high affinity finally , the active site cycles back to the open state ( orange ) , releasing atp and binding more adp and phosphate , ready for the next cycle of atp production large-enough quantities of atp cause it to create a transmembrane proton gradient , this is used by fermenting bacteria that do not have an electron transport chain , but rather hydrolyze atp to make a proton gradient , which they use to drive flagella and the transport of nutrients into the cell the modular evolution theory for the origin of atp synthase suggests that two subunits with independent function , a dna helicase with atpase activity and a motor , were able to bind , and the rotation of the motor drove the atpase activity of the helicase in reverse in plants , atp synthase is also present in chloroplasts ( cf 1 f o -atp synthase ) the atp synthase isolated from bovine ( bos taurus ) heart mitochondria is , in terms of biochemistry and structure , the best-characterized atp synthase a euglenozoa atp synthase forms a dimer with a boomerang-shaped f 1 head like other mitochondrial atp synthases , but the f o subcomplex has many unique subunits

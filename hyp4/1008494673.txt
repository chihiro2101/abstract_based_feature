walker , then at the laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge , crystallized the f 1 catalytic-domain of atp synthase the structure of the intact atp synthase is currently known at low-resolution from electron cryo-microscopy ( cryo-em ) studies of the complex under the right conditions , the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse , with atp hydrolysis driving proton pump across the membrane finally , the active site cycles back to the open state ( orange ) , releasing atp and binding more adp and phosphate , ready for the next cycle of atp production in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy the same process takes place in the mitochondria , where atp synthase is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the f 1 -part projects into the mitochondrial matrix this association appears to have occurred early in evolutionary history , because essentially the same structure and activity of atp synthase enzymes are present in all kingdoms of life however , whereas the f-atp synthase generates atp by utilising a proton gradient , the v-atpase generates a proton gradient at the expense of atp , generating ph values of as low as 1 atp synthase is the simplest known form of atp synthase , with 8 different subunit types the enzyme is integrated into thylakoid membrane ; the cf 1 -part sticks into stroma , where dark reactions of photosynthesis ( also called the light-independent reactions or the calvin cycle ) and atp synthesis take place a euglenozoa atp synthase forms a dimer with a boomerang-shaped f 1 head like other mitochondrial atp synthases , but the f o subcomplex has many unique subunits instead , they synthesize atp using the a-atpase/synthase , a rotary machine structually similar to the v-atpase but mainly functioning as an atp synthase

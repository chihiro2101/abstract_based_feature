the f 1 fraction derives its name from the term '' fraction 1 '' and f o ( written as a subscript letter '' o '' , not '' zero '' ) derives its name from being the binding fraction for oligomycin , a type of naturally derived antibiotic that is able to inhibit the f o unit of atp synthase in the 1960s through the 1970s , paul boyer , a ucla professor , developed the binding change , or flip-flop , mechanism theory , which postulated that atp synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in atp synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit according to the current model of atp synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( h+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( h+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the f o region of atp synthase the c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk ( consisting primarily of the gamma subunit ) , causing it to rotate within the alpha 3 beta 3 of f 1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to atp synthesis the cryo-em model of atp synthase suggests that the peripheral stalk is a flexible structure that wraps around the complex as it joins f 1 to f o finally , the active site cycles back to the open state ( orange ) , releasing atp and binding more adp and phosphate , ready for the next cycle of atp production large-enough quantities of atp cause it to create a transmembrane proton gradient , this is used by fermenting bacteria that do not have an electron transport chain , but rather hydrolyze atp to make a proton gradient , which they use to drive flagella and the transport of nutrients into the cell in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy however , whereas the f-atp synthase generates atp by utilising a proton gradient , the v-atpase generates a proton gradient at the expense of atp , generating ph values of as low as 1 atp synthase is the simplest known form of atp synthase , with 8 different subunit types in plants , atp synthase is also present in chloroplasts ( cf 1 f o -atp synthase ) a euglenozoa atp synthase forms a dimer with a boomerang-shaped f 1 head like other mitochondrial atp synthases , but the f o subcomplex has many unique subunits

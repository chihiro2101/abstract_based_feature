the f 1 fraction derives its name from the term '' fraction 1 '' and f o ( written as a subscript letter '' o '' , not '' zero '' ) derives its name from being the binding fraction for oligomycin , a type of naturally derived antibiotic that is able to inhibit the f o unit of atp synthase in the 1960s through the 1970s , paul boyer , a ucla professor , developed the binding change , or flip-flop , mechanism theory , which postulated that atp synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in atp synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit walker , then at the laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge , crystallized the f 1 catalytic-domain of atp synthase according to the current model of atp synthesis ( known as the alternating catalytic model ) , the transmembrane potential created by ( h+ ) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain , drives the ( h+ ) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the f o region of atp synthase under the right conditions , the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse , with atp hydrolysis driving proton pump across the membrane finally , the active site cycles back to the open state ( orange ) , releasing atp and binding more adp and phosphate , ready for the next cycle of atp production like other enzymes , the activity of f 1 f o atp synthase is reversible in respiring bacteria under physiological conditions , atp synthase , in general , runs in the opposite direction , creating atp while using the proton motive force created by the electron transfer chain as a source of energy atp synthase is the simplest known form of atp synthase , with 8 different subunit types in plants , atp synthase is also present in chloroplasts ( cf 1 f o -atp synthase ) the atp synthase isolated from bovine ( bos taurus ) heart mitochondria is , in terms of biochemistry and structure , the best-characterized atp synthase a euglenozoa atp synthase forms a dimer with a boomerang-shaped f 1 head like other mitochondrial atp synthases , but the f o subcomplex has many unique subunits

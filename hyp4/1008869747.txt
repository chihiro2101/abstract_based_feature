egyptologists have suggested that tiye 's father , yuya , was of foreign origin due to the features of his mummy and the many different spellings of his name , which might imply it was a non-egyptian name in origin ay , a successor of tutankhamun as pharaoh after the latter 's death , is believed to be yet another brother of tiye , despite no clear date or monument confirming a link between the two egyptology presume this connection from ay 's origins ( also from akhmin ) , because he is known to have built a chapel dedicated to the local god min there , and because he inherited most of the titles that tiye 's father , yuya , held at the court of amenhotep iii during his lifetime p.253 tiye was married to amenhotep iii by the second year of his reign their marriage was celebrated by the issue of commemorative scarabs , announcing tiye as great royal wife and giving the names of her parents akhenaten – succeeded his father as pharaoh , husband of queen nefertiti , father of ankhesenamun , who married tutankhamun aidan dodson , '' amarna sunset : nefertiti , tutankhamun , ay , horemhab and the egyptian counter-reformation '' ( cairo : auc press , 2010 ) , pp.27-29 sometimes identified with the mummy from kv55 , and therefore tutankhamun 's father the younger lady from kv35 – a daughter of amenhotep iii and tiye , mother of tutankhamun and sister-wife of kv55 presumably one of the already-known daughters of amenhotep iii and tiye amenhotep iii died in year 38 or year 39 of his reign ( 1353 bc/1350 bc ) and was buried in the valley of the kings in wv22 ; however , tiye is known to have outlived him by as many as twelve years in an inscription approximately dated to november 21 of year 12 of akhenaten 's reign ( 1338 bc ) , both she and her granddaughter meketaten are mentioned for the last time this information is corroborated by the fact that the shrine which akhenaten created for her—which was later found transported from amarna to tomb kv55 in thebes—bore the later form of the aten 's name which was only used after akhenaten 's year 9 the mummy of the older woman , who would later be identified as tiye , was referred to by egyptologists as the 'elder lady ' while the other woman was 'the younger lady ' in 1976 , microprobe analysis conducted on hair samples from the elder lady and the lock from the inscribed coffins found the two were a near perfect match , thereby identifying the elder lady as tiye

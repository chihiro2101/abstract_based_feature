shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight more were sold to autonetics to build the guidance system for the minuteman ballistic missile one such casualty was philco 's transistor division , whose newly built 40 million plant to make their germanium padt process transistors became unviable within a few years every other transistor company paralleled or licensed the fairchild planar process fairchild 's noyce and texas instrument 's kilby had independently invented the integrated circuit ( ic ) based on bipolar technology in the early 1960s , fairchild r & d began experimenting with the mosfet ( metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ) , also known as the mos transistor however , the mosfet generated significant interest at fairchild inspired by the first mosfet , chih-tang sah built an mos-controlled tetrode at fairchild later that year mos devices were later commercialized by fairchild in 1964 , with p-channel devices for logic and switching applications the experiments led to fairchild 's development of mos integrated circuits in 1963 , fairchild hired bob widlar to design analog operational amplifiers using fairchild 's process in 1968 , fairchild introduced david fullagar 's µa741 , which became the most popular ic op amp of all time by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states fairchild dominated the market in dtl , op-amps and mainframe computer custom circuits in 1965 , fairchild opened a semiconductor assembly plant on the navajo nation in shiprock , new mexico their first line of ics was the '' micrologic '' resistor–transistor logic ( rtl ) line which was used in the apollo guidance computer it was awhile before fairchild relied on more robust designs , such as diode–transistor logic ( dtl ) which had much better noise margins noyce was rewarded with the position of corporate vice-president and hence became the de facto head of the semiconductor division however , internal trouble at fairchild began to surface with a drop in earnings in 1967 fairchild 's president at that time , john carter , had used all the profits to fund acquisitions of unprofitable ventures executives at the semiconductor division were allotted substantially fewer stock options compared to other divisions sporck brought with him four other fairchild personnel when negotiations with plessey broke down over stock options , lamond and sporck succumbed to widlar 's and talbert 's ( who were already employed at national semiconductor ) suggestion that they look to national semiconductor , ; page 260 widlar and talbert had earlier left fairchild to join molectro , which was later acquired by national semiconductor on september 6 , 2001 , fairchild semiconductor announced the acquisition of impala linear corporation , based in san jose , california , for approximately 6 million in stock and cash ) on september 19 , 2016 , on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor jointly announced that on semiconductor had completed its announced 2.4 billion cash acquisition of fairchild

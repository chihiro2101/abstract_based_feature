in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company the eight men were julius blank , victor grinich , jean hoerni , eugene kleiner , jay last , gordon moore , robert noyce , and sheldon roberts looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight noyce advocated the use of silicon as substrate & nbsp ; – since the material costs would consist of sand and a few fine wires , the major cost would be in the manufacturing process fairchild 's first marketed transistor was the 1958 2n696 , a mesa transistor developed by moore , and it was a huge success one such casualty was philco 's transistor division , whose newly built 40 million plant to make their germanium padt process transistors became unviable fairchild 's noyce and texas instrument 's kilby had independently invented the integrated circuit ( ic ) based on bipolar technology mos devices were later commercialized by fairchild in 1964 , with p-channel devices for logic and switching applications the experiments led to fairchild 's development of mos integrated circuits in 1968 , fairchild introduced david fullagar 's µa741 , which became the most popular ic op amp of all time by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states in 1965 , fairchild opened a semiconductor assembly plant on the navajo nation in shiprock , new mexico '' this claim was based on the opinion that circuits of the electronic chips had a mere resemblance with the complex geometric patterns on the navajo rugs their first line of ics was the '' micrologic '' resistor–transistor logic ( rtl ) line which was used in the apollo guidance computer it was awhile before fairchild relied on more robust designs , such as diode–transistor logic ( dtl ) which had much better noise margins noyce was rewarded with the position of corporate vice-president and hence became the de facto head of the semiconductor division executives at the semiconductor division were allotted substantially fewer stock options compared to other divisions sprague to national semiconductor sporck brought with him four other fairchild personnel actually , lamond had previously assembled a team of fairchild managers in preparation to defect to plessey , a british company national semiconductor founding in the fall of 1967 , fairchild suffered a loss for the first time since 1958 and announced write-offs of 4 million due to excess capacity , which contributed to a total loss of 7.6 million at this time , fairchild 's intellectual properties , on which fairchild had been subsisting , were expiring in 1997 , the reconstituted fairchild semiconductor was reborn as an independent company , based in south portland , maine with kirk pond as ceo on september 6 , 2001 , fairchild semiconductor announced the acquisition of impala linear corporation , based in san jose , california , for approximately 6 million in stock and cash ) on september 19 , 2016 , on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor jointly announced that on semiconductor had completed its announced 2.4 billion cash acquisition of fairchild in the fall of 2016 , the fairchild 'on ' semiconductor international closed the west jordan , utah , manufacturing plant

in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s company with considerable military contracts in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight the first batch of 100 was sold to ibm for 150 a piece in order to build the computer for the b-70 bomber within a few years every other transistor company paralleled or licensed the fairchild planar process in turn , hoerni 's planar process was inspired by the surface passivation method developed by mohamed atalla at bell labs in 1957 in the early 1960s , fairchild r & d began experimenting with the mosfet ( metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ) , also known as the mos transistor the first mosfet was invented by mohamed atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs in 1959 , and demonstrated in early 1960 , but was initially overlooked and ignored by bell labs the experiments led to fairchild 's development of mos integrated circuits in 1963 , fairchild hired bob widlar to design analog operational amplifiers using fairchild 's process since fairchild 's processes were optimized for digital circuits , widlar collaborated with process engineer dave talbert hence , fairchild dominated the analog integrated circuit market , having introduced the first ic operational amplifiers , or '' op-amps '' , bob widlar 's µa702 ( in 1964 ) and µa709 fairchild dominated the market in dtl , op-amps and mainframe computer custom circuits in 1965 , fairchild opened a semiconductor assembly plant on the navajo nation in shiprock , new mexico fairchild had not done well in the digital integrated circuit market it was awhile before fairchild relied on more robust designs , such as diode–transistor logic ( dtl ) which had much better noise margins sales due to fairchild semiconductor division had doubled each year and by the mid-1960s comprised two-thirds of total sales of the parent company noyce was rewarded with the position of corporate vice-president and hence became the de facto head of the semiconductor division sherman fairchild hired lester hogan , who was the head of motorola semiconductor division hogan proceeded to hire another hundred managers from motorola to entirely displace the management of fairchild the fairchild semiconductor corporation announced november 27 , 1997 that it would acquire the semiconductor division of the raytheon corporation for about 120 million in cash the acquisition moved fairchild into position as the second-largest power mosfet supplier in the world , representing a 20 percent share of this 3 billion market that grew 40 percent last year thompson would also be president , chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of fairchild semiconductor international in april 2011 , fairchild semiconductor acquired transic , a silicon carbide power transistor company originally based in sweden ) on september 19 , 2016 , on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor jointly announced that on semiconductor had completed its announced 2.4 billion cash acquisition of fairchild the silicon gate technology , developed at fairchild in 1968 by f

in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company the eight men were julius blank , victor grinich , jean hoerni , eugene kleiner , jay last , gordon moore , robert noyce , and sheldon roberts looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight fairchild 's first marketed transistor was the 1958 2n696 , a mesa transistor developed by moore , and it was a huge success within a few years every other transistor company paralleled or licensed the fairchild planar process in 1960 , fairchild built a circuit with four transistors on a single wafer of silicon , thereby creating the first silicon integrated circuit ( texas instruments ' jack kilby had developed an integrated circuit made of germanium on september 12 , 1958 , and was awarded a u.s inspired by the first mosfet , chih-tang sah built an mos-controlled tetrode at fairchild later that year mos devices were later commercialized by fairchild in 1964 , with p-channel devices for logic and switching applications the experiments led to fairchild 's development of mos integrated circuits in 1963 , fairchild hired bob widlar to design analog operational amplifiers using fairchild 's process since fairchild 's processes were optimized for digital circuits , widlar collaborated with process engineer dave talbert in 1968 , fairchild introduced david fullagar 's µa741 , which became the most popular ic op amp of all time by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states paul driscoll , the shiprock plant manager , spoke of the '' untapped wealth of natural characteristics of the navajo.the inherent flexibility and dexterity of the indians their first line of ics was the '' micrologic '' resistor–transistor logic ( rtl ) line which was used in the apollo guidance computer it was awhile before fairchild relied on more robust designs , such as diode–transistor logic ( dtl ) which had much better noise margins sales due to fairchild semiconductor division had doubled each year and by the mid-1960s comprised two-thirds of total sales of the parent company noyce was rewarded with the position of corporate vice-president and hence became the de facto head of the semiconductor division fairchild 's president at that time , john carter , had used all the profits to fund acquisitions of unprofitable ventures , ; page 260 widlar and talbert had earlier left fairchild to join molectro , which was later acquired by national semiconductor the sale did not include fairchild 's test division , which designed and produced automated test equipment ( ate ) for the semiconductor manufacturing industry , nor did it include schlumberger palo alto research in 1997 , the reconstituted fairchild semiconductor was reborn as an independent company , based in south portland , maine with kirk pond as ceo fairchild 's south portland , maine and mountaintop , pennsylvania locations are the longest continuously operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world , both operating since 1960 thompson would also be president , chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of fairchild semiconductor international in the fall of 2016 , the fairchild 'on ' semiconductor international closed the west jordan , utah , manufacturing plant the silicon gate technology , developed at fairchild in 1968 by f

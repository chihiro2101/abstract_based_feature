in 1956 , william shockley opened shockley semiconductor laboratory as a division of beckman instruments in mountain view , california ; his plan was to develop a new type of '' 4-layer diode '' that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of american engineering schools a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight noyce advocated the use of silicon as substrate & nbsp ; – since the material costs would consist of sand and a few fine wires , the major cost would be in the manufacturing process noyce also expressed his belief that silicon semiconductors would herald the start of disposable appliances that , due to cheap electronic components , would not be repaired but merely discarded when worn out fairchild 's first marketed transistor was the 1958 2n696 , a mesa transistor developed by moore , and it was a huge success within a few years every other transistor company paralleled or licensed the fairchild planar process hoerni 's 2n1613 was a major success , with fairchild licensing the design across the industry fairchild 's noyce and texas instrument 's kilby had independently invented the integrated circuit ( ic ) based on bipolar technology the industry preferred fairchild 's invention over texas instruments ' because the transistors in planar ics were interconnected by a thin film deposit , whereas texas instruments ' invention required fine wires to connect the individual circuits in the early 1960s , fairchild r & d began experimenting with the mosfet ( metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ) , also known as the mos transistor however , the mosfet generated significant interest at fairchild the experiments led to fairchild 's development of mos integrated circuits in 1963 , fairchild hired bob widlar to design analog operational amplifiers using fairchild 's process by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states fairchild had not done well in the digital integrated circuit market it was awhile before fairchild relied on more robust designs , such as diode–transistor logic ( dtl ) which had much better noise margins in 1966 , fairchild 's sales were second to those of texas instruments , followed in third place by motorola the semiconductor division , situated in mountain view and palo alto , california , was actually managed by executives from syosset , new york , who visited the california sites once a year , even though the semiconductor division earned most of the profits of the company noyce 's position on fairchild 's executive staff was consistently compromised by sherman fairchild 's faction actually , lamond had previously assembled a team of fairchild managers in preparation to defect to plessey , a british company national semiconductor founding in the fall of 1967 , fairchild suffered a loss for the first time since 1958 and announced write-offs of 4 million due to excess capacity , which contributed to a total loss of 7.6 million the loss of these iconic executives , coupled with hogan 's displacement of fairchild managers demoralized fairchild and prompted the entire exodus of employees to found new companies in 1973 , fairchild became the first company to produce a commercial charge-coupled device ( ccd ) following its invention at bell labs in august 1999 , fairchild semiconductor again became a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange with the ticker symbol fcs fairchild 's south portland , maine and mountaintop , pennsylvania locations are the longest continuously operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world , both operating since 1960 in april 2011 , fairchild semiconductor acquired transic , a silicon carbide power transistor company originally based in sweden

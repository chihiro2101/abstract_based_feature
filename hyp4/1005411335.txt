at first he attempted to hire some of his former colleagues from bell labs , but none were willing to move to the west coast or work with shockley again at that time a core group of shockley employees , later known as the traitorous eight , became unhappy with his management of the company the eight men were julius blank , victor grinich , jean hoerni , eugene kleiner , jay last , gordon moore , robert noyce , and sheldon roberts looking for funding on their own project , they turned to sherman fairchild 's fairchild camera and instrument , an eastern u.s in 1957 the fairchild semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use according to sherman fairchild , noyce 's impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason sherman fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight noyce also expressed his belief that silicon semiconductors would herald the start of disposable appliances that , due to cheap electronic components , would not be repaired but merely discarded when worn out their first transistors were of the silicon mesa variety , innovative for their time , but relatively poor reliability fairchild 's first marketed transistor was the 1958 2n696 , a mesa transistor developed by moore , and it was a huge success hoerni 's 2n1613 was a major success , with fairchild licensing the design across the industry fairchild 's noyce and texas instrument 's kilby had independently invented the integrated circuit ( ic ) based on bipolar technology in the early 1960s , fairchild r & d began experimenting with the mosfet ( metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor ) , also known as the mos transistor the first mosfet was invented by mohamed atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs in 1959 , and demonstrated in early 1960 , but was initially overlooked and ignored by bell labs in 1963 , fairchild hired bob widlar to design analog operational amplifiers using fairchild 's process since fairchild 's processes were optimized for digital circuits , widlar collaborated with process engineer dave talbert hence , fairchild dominated the analog integrated circuit market , having introduced the first ic operational amplifiers , or '' op-amps '' , bob widlar 's µa702 ( in 1964 ) and µa709 in 1968 , fairchild introduced david fullagar 's µa741 , which became the most popular ic op amp of all time by 1965 , fairchild 's process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry & nbsp ; – making fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the united states fairchild dominated the market in dtl , op-amps and mainframe computer custom circuits in 1965 , fairchild opened a semiconductor assembly plant on the navajo nation in shiprock , new mexico '' this claim was based on the opinion that circuits of the electronic chips had a mere resemblance with the complex geometric patterns on the navajo rugs paul driscoll , the shiprock plant manager , spoke of the '' untapped wealth of natural characteristics of the navajo.the inherent flexibility and dexterity of the indians fairchild had not done well in the digital integrated circuit market in 1966 , fairchild 's sales were second to those of texas instruments , followed in third place by motorola noyce was rewarded with the position of corporate vice-president and hence became the de facto head of the semiconductor division noyce 's position on fairchild 's executive staff was consistently compromised by sherman fairchild 's faction sherman fairchild hired lester hogan , who was the head of motorola semiconductor division the loss of these iconic executives , coupled with hogan 's displacement of fairchild managers demoralized fairchild and prompted the entire exodus of employees to found new companies the fairchild semiconductor corporation announced november 27 , 1997 that it would acquire the semiconductor division of the raytheon corporation for about 120 million in cash ) on september 19 , 2016 , on semiconductor and fairchild semiconductor jointly announced that on semiconductor had completed its announced 2.4 billion cash acquisition of fairchild

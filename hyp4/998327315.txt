overview of vertebrate brain development the vertebrate central nervous system ( cns ) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo this is a part of the early patterning of the embryo ( including the invertebrate embryo ) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages , and from adult csf ; it influences the behavior of neural precursors because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times image : development of nervous system.svg thumbnail 750px center flowchart of human brain development typically , these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes : activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent plasticity activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience although synapse formation is an activity-independent event , modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including the mouse mus musculus , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish danio rerio , the frog xenopus laevis , and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly mcr is also useful for tracking white matter maturation , which plays an important role in cognitive development the conversion of undifferentiated ectoderm to neuroectoderm requires signals from the mesoderm neuroectoderm overlying the notochord develops into the neural plate in response to a diffusible signal produced by the notochord in the early embryo , the neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube the hollow interior is called the neural canal , and the open ends of the neural tube , called the neuropores , close off a transplanted blastopore lip can convert ectoderm into neural tissue and is said to have an inductive effect neural inducers are molecules that can induce the expression of neural genes in ectoderm explants without inducing mesodermal genes as well neural induction is often studied in xenopus embryos since they have a simple body plan and there are good markers to distinguish between neural and non-neural tissue examples of neural inducers are the molecules noggin and chordin during neural induction , noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm ( notochord ) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of bmp4 inhibition of tgf-β and bmp ( bone morphogenetic protein ) signaling can efficiently induce neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure patterning of the nervous system the ventral neural tube is patterned by sonic hedgehog ( shh ) from the notochord , which acts as the inducing tissue at low concentrations it forms ventral interneurons , at higher concentrations it induces motor neuron development , and at highest concentrations it induces floor plate differentiation the dorsal neural tube is patterned by bmps from the epidermal ectoderm flanking the neural plate signals that control anteroposterior neural development include fgf and retinoic acid , which act in the hindbrain and spinal cord neurogenesis is the process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several sequential steps by tet enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions ( e.g it is estimated that glial guided migration represents 90 % of migrating neurons in human and about 75 % in rodents activity-dependent mechanisms influence neural circuit development and are crucial for laying out early connectivity maps and the continued refinement of synapses which occurs during development they have distinct spatial and temporal patterns during development and their ablation during development has been known to result in deficits in network refinement in the visual system neural development ( peer-reviewed open access journal )

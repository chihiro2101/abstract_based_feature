a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo this is a part of the early patterning of the embryo ( including the invertebrate embryo ) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube as the embryo develops , the anterior part of the neural tube expands and forms three primary brain vesicles , which become the forebrain ( prosencephalon ) , midbrain ( mesencephalon ) , and hindbrain ( rhombencephalon ) the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells , which are the main cellular components of the cns the newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing , and underlie behavior image : development of nervous system.svg thumbnail 750px center flowchart of human brain development activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience although synapse formation is an activity-independent event , modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity myelination , formation of the lipid myelin sheath around neuronal axons , is a process that is essential for normal brain function the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is a non-invasive technique used to investigate myelination and cortical maturation ( the cortex is the outer layer of the brain composed of gray matter ) multicomponent relaxometry ( mcr ) allow visualization and quantification of myelin content because there is little evidence of a relationship between myelination and cortical thickness , it was revealed that cortical thickness is independent of white matter at the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore lip and form a layer of mesoderm in between the endoderm and the ectoderm neuroectoderm overlying the notochord develops into the neural plate in response to a diffusible signal produced by the notochord in the early embryo , the neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube a transplanted blastopore lip can convert ectoderm into neural tissue and is said to have an inductive effect neural inducers are molecules that can induce the expression of neural genes in ectoderm explants without inducing mesodermal genes as well when embryonic ectodermal cells are cultured at low density in the absence of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation ( express neural genes ) , suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells this inhibition of bmp4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure the optical vesicle ( which eventually become the optic nerve , retina and iris ) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon the ventral half of the neural plate is controlled by the notochord , which acts as the 'organiser ' the dorsal half is controlled by the ectoderm plate , which flanks either side of the neural plate evidence for this comes from single , cultured cells of ectoderm , which go on to form neural tissue the ventral neural tube is patterned by sonic hedgehog ( shh ) from the notochord , which acts as the inducing tissue at low concentrations it forms ventral interneurons , at higher concentrations it induces motor neuron development , and at highest concentrations it induces floor plate differentiation neurogenesis is the process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells neuronal migration is the method by which neurons travel from their origin or birthplace to their final position in the brain induction of synapse formation by glial factors : barres and colleagues made the observation that factors in glial conditioned media induce synapse formation in retinal ganglion cell cultures the processes of neuronal migration , differentiation and axon guidance are generally believed to be activity-independent mechanisms and rely on hard-wired genetic programs in the neurons themselves translating neurodevelopmental time across mammalian species the child ’ s developing brain brain development how poverty might change the brain the teenage brain

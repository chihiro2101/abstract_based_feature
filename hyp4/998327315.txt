overview of vertebrate brain development the vertebrate central nervous system ( cns ) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages , and from adult csf ; it influences the behavior of neural precursors because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells , which are the main cellular components of the cns image : development of nervous system.svg thumbnail 750px center flowchart of human brain development typically , these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes : activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent plasticity these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience although synapse formation is an activity-independent event , modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including the mouse mus musculus , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish danio rerio , the frog xenopus laevis , and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly rather than showing the actual myelin , the mri picks up on the myelin water fraction , a measure of myelin content mcr is also useful for tracking white matter maturation , which plays an important role in cognitive development because there is little evidence of a relationship between myelination and cortical thickness , it was revealed that cortical thickness is independent of white matter this allows various aspects of the brain to grow simultaneously , leading to a more fully developed brain during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system mesodermal cells migrate along the dorsal midline to give rise to the notochord that develops into the vertebral column the ability of the mesoderm to convert the overlying ectoderm into neural tissue is called neural induction in the early embryo , the neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube the formation of the neural tube from the ectoderm is called neurulation the ventral part of the neural tube is called the basal plate ; the dorsal part is called the alar plate the hollow interior is called the neural canal , and the open ends of the neural tube , called the neuropores , close off this inhibition of bmp4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells inhibition of tgf-β and bmp ( bone morphogenetic protein ) signaling can efficiently induce neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells in chordates , dorsal ectoderm forms all neural tissue and the nervous system the ventral half of the neural plate is controlled by the notochord , which acts as the 'organiser ' the dorsal half is controlled by the ectoderm plate , which flanks either side of the neural plate floor plate-derived shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube , and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains loss of shh from the notochord and/or floor plate prevents proper specification of these progenitor domains the acetylcholine receptor ( achr ) is present at the surface of muscle cells before synapse formation there are two distinct types of neural activity we observe in developing circuits -early spontaneous activity and sensory-evoked activity spontaneous activity occurs early during neural circuit development even when sensory input is absent and is observed in many systems such as the developing visual system , auditory system , motor system , hippocampus , cerebellum and neocortex in the developing auditory system , developing cochlea generate bursts of activity which spreads across the inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons which relay auditory information to the brain

the vertebrate central nervous system ( cns ) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo this is a part of the early patterning of the embryo ( including the invertebrate embryo ) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube as the embryo develops , the anterior part of the neural tube expands and forms three primary brain vesicles , which become the forebrain ( prosencephalon ) , midbrain ( mesencephalon ) , and hindbrain ( rhombencephalon ) the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages , and from adult csf ; it influences the behavior of neural precursors because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells , which are the main cellular components of the cns the newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing , and underlie behavior image : development of nervous system.svg thumbnail 750px center flowchart of human brain development activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience although synapse formation is an activity-independent event , modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity developmental neuroscience uses a variety of animal models including the mouse mus musculus , the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster , the zebrafish danio rerio , the frog xenopus laevis , and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly mcr is also useful for tracking white matter maturation , which plays an important role in cognitive development during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system at the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore lip and form a layer of mesoderm in between the endoderm and the ectoderm mesodermal cells migrate along the dorsal midline to give rise to the notochord that develops into the vertebral column the ventral part of the neural tube is called the basal plate ; the dorsal part is called the alar plate neural inducers are molecules that can induce the expression of neural genes in ectoderm explants without inducing mesodermal genes as well neural induction is often studied in xenopus embryos since they have a simple body plan and there are good markers to distinguish between neural and non-neural tissue this is due to the action of bmp4 ( a tgf-β family protein ) that induces ectodermal cultures to differentiate into epidermis during neural induction , noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm ( notochord ) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of bmp4 this inhibition of bmp4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells the alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the telencephalon which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres , whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon in chordates , dorsal ectoderm forms all neural tissue and the nervous system the dorsal half is controlled by the ectoderm plate , which flanks either side of the neural plate the ventral neural tube is patterned by sonic hedgehog ( shh ) from the notochord , which acts as the inducing tissue at low concentrations it forms ventral interneurons , at higher concentrations it induces motor neuron development , and at highest concentrations it induces floor plate differentiation the dorsal neural tube is patterned by bmps from the epidermal ectoderm flanking the neural plate neurogenesis is the process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells activity-dependent mechanisms influence neural circuit development and are crucial for laying out early connectivity maps and the continued refinement of synapses which occurs during development there are two distinct types of neural activity we observe in developing circuits -early spontaneous activity and sensory-evoked activity neural development ( peer-reviewed open access journal )

overview of vertebrate brain development the vertebrate central nervous system ( cns ) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo this is a part of the early patterning of the embryo ( including the invertebrate embryo ) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times the newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing , and underlie behavior image : development of nervous system.svg thumbnail 750px center flowchart of human brain development activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons myelination , formation of the lipid myelin sheath around neuronal axons , is a process that is essential for normal brain function the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems without it , the impulse would be disrupted and the signal would not reach its target , thus impairing normal functioning because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly multicomponent relaxometry ( mcr ) allow visualization and quantification of myelin content mcr is also useful for tracking white matter maturation , which plays an important role in cognitive development at the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore lip and form a layer of mesoderm in between the endoderm and the ectoderm the ability of the mesoderm to convert the overlying ectoderm into neural tissue is called neural induction in the early embryo , the neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube the formation of the neural tube from the ectoderm is called neurulation the hollow interior is called the neural canal , and the open ends of the neural tube , called the neuropores , close off a transplanted blastopore lip can convert ectoderm into neural tissue and is said to have an inductive effect during neural induction , noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm ( notochord ) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of bmp4 this inhibition of bmp4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells inhibition of tgf-β and bmp ( bone morphogenetic protein ) signaling can efficiently induce neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure patterning of the nervous system patterning occurs due to specific environmental conditions - different concentrations of signaling molecules the ventral neural tube is patterned by sonic hedgehog ( shh ) from the notochord , which acts as the inducing tissue notochord-derived shh signals to the floor plate , and induces shh expression in the floor plate floor plate-derived shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube , and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains shh binds patched , relieving patched-mediated inhibition of smoothened , leading to activation of the gli family of transcription factors ( gli1 , gli2 , and gli3 ) the dorsal neural tube is patterned by bmps from the epidermal ectoderm flanking the neural plate neuronal precursor cells proliferate in the ventricular zone of the developing neocortex , where the principal neural stem cell is the radial glial cell the processes of neuronal migration , differentiation and axon guidance are generally believed to be activity-independent mechanisms and rely on hard-wired genetic programs in the neurons themselves activity-dependent mechanisms influence neural circuit development and are crucial for laying out early connectivity maps and the continued refinement of synapses which occurs during development they have distinct spatial and temporal patterns during development and their ablation during development has been known to result in deficits in network refinement in the visual system

overview of vertebrate brain development the vertebrate central nervous system ( cns ) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo this is a part of the early patterning of the embryo ( including the invertebrate embryo ) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis the neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the cns the neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate , and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube the csf-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord , and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the cns embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages , and from adult csf ; it influences the behavior of neural precursors because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida during this time , the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells , which drive brain growth as they divide many times the newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures once the neurons have reached their regional positions , they extend axons and dendrites , which allow them to communicate with other neurons via synapses synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing , and underlie behavior image : development of nervous system.svg thumbnail 750px center flowchart of human brain development typically , these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes : activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent plasticity activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons these processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience although synapse formation is an activity-independent event , modification of synapses and synapse elimination requires neural activity the myelin sheath provides insulation for the nerve impulse when communicating between neural systems without it , the impulse would be disrupted and the signal would not reach its target , thus impairing normal functioning because so much of brain development occurs in the prenatal stage and infancy , it is crucial that myelination , along with cortical development occur properly mcr is also useful for tracking white matter maturation , which plays an important role in cognitive development during early embryonic development of the vertebrate , the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system ; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neuroectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system neuroectoderm overlying the notochord develops into the neural plate in response to a diffusible signal produced by the notochord the ability of the mesoderm to convert the overlying ectoderm into neural tissue is called neural induction in the early embryo , the neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove beginning in the future neck region , the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube the hollow interior is called the neural canal , and the open ends of the neural tube , called the neuropores , close off during neural induction , noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm ( notochord ) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of bmp4 inhibition of tgf-β and bmp ( bone morphogenetic protein ) signaling can efficiently induce neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells in a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon , at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure the optical vesicle ( which eventually become the optic nerve , retina and iris ) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon in chordates , dorsal ectoderm forms all neural tissue and the nervous system the ventral half of the neural plate is controlled by the notochord , which acts as the 'organiser ' floor plate-derived shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube , and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains shh binds patched , relieving patched-mediated inhibition of smoothened , leading to activation of the gli family of transcription factors ( gli1 , gli2 , and gli3 ) in this context shh acts as a morphogen - it induces cell differentiation dependent on its concentration the dorsal neural tube is patterned by bmps from the epidermal ectoderm flanking the neural plate activity-dependent mechanisms influence neural circuit development and are crucial for laying out early connectivity maps and the continued refinement of synapses which occurs during development translating neurodevelopmental time across mammalian species the child ’ s developing brain brain development how poverty might change the brain the teenage brain

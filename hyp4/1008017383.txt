tibullus 's chief friend and patron was marcus valerius messalla corvinus , himself an orator and poet as well as a statesman and a commander this circle had no relationship with the court , and the name of augustus is found nowhere in the writings of tibullus about 30 bc messalla was dispatched by augustus to gaul to quell a rising in aquitania and restore order in the country , and tibullus may have been in his retinue on a later occasion , probably in 28 , he would have accompanied his friend who had been sent on a mission to the east , but he fell sick and had to stay behind in corcyra tibullus had no liking for war , and though his life seems to have been divided between rome and his country estate , his own preferences were wholly for the country life the loss of tibullus 's landed property is attested by himself ( i.1 , 19 ) , as a farmer '' felicis quondam , nunc pauperis agri '' ( '' of a once fruitful , now impoverished field '' ; cf tibullus may have been messalla 's contubernalis in the aquitanian war ( vita tib , a poem composed for messalla 's triumph ) , and may have received dona militaria ( vita tib tibullus died prematurely , probably in 19 , and almost immediately after virgil his death made a deep impression in rome , as is clear from his contemporary , domitius marsus , and from the elegy in which ovid ovid , amores , iii.9 tibullus 's first book consists of poems written at various times between 30 and 26 his first love , the subject of book i the fifth elegy was written during estrangement ( discidium ) , and the sixth after the return of the husband and during delia 's double infidelity delia was clever in deceptionâ€”too clever , as tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover his entreaties and appeals were of no avail ; and after the first book no more is heard of delia in addition , several elegies in book i concern themselves with tibullus 's love for a boy , who is named marathus the three poems centered on marathus constitute the longest poetic project in roman literature having homosexual love as theme the first of these poems , 1.4 , begins with an imprecation of the poet to the god priapus , asking for advice on how to win over beautiful boys he later portrays himself as a teacher in the affairs of love , declaring that the doors of his house are open for other men in love with boys to ask his advice ( 1.4.78 ) the cycle is resumed in poem 1.8 , in which the narrator learns that marathus is in love with a girl about the second book , scholars can only say that in all likelihood it was published before the poet 's death in 19 bc in the second book the place of delia is taken by '' nemesis '' , which is also a fictitious name nemesis ( like the cynthia of propertius ) was probably a courtesan of the higher class ; and she had other admirers besides tibullus ovid , writing at the time of tibullus 's death , says : ovid , amores , iii.9 , 31-32 '' ( '' in elegy as well we rival the greeks ; of whom for me the author tibullus seems the most polished and elegant ; there are those who prefer propertius ; ovid is more wanton than either , just as gallus is more stern only the first and second books can uncontroversially claim his authorship he has a good many reminiscences and imitations of tibullus , propertius propertius , iii 2-6 , containing ninety-four lines , in which the theme of the attachment is worked up into five graceful poems the thirteenth poem ( twenty-four lines ) claims to be by tibullus ; but it is hardly more than a cento from tibullus and propertius the natural conclusion is that a collection of scattered compositions , relating to messalla and the members of his circle , was added as an appendix to the genuine relics of tibullus tibullus was first printed with catullus , propertius , and the silvae of statius by vindelinus de spira ( venice , 1472 ) , and separately by florentius de argentina , probably in the same year

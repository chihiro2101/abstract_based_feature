tibullus 's chief friend and patron was marcus valerius messalla corvinus , himself an orator and poet as well as a statesman and a commander messalla , like gaius maecenas , was at the centre of a literary circle in rome this circle had no relationship with the court , and the name of augustus is found nowhere in the writings of tibullus about 30 bc messalla was dispatched by augustus to gaul to quell a rising in aquitania and restore order in the country , and tibullus may have been in his retinue tibullus had no liking for war , and though his life seems to have been divided between rome and his country estate , his own preferences were wholly for the country life , a poem composed for messalla 's triumph ) , and may have received dona militaria ( vita tib tibullus died prematurely , probably in 19 , and almost immediately after virgil his death made a deep impression in rome , as is clear from his contemporary , domitius marsus , and from the elegy in which ovid ovid , amores , iii.9 tibullus 's first book consists of poems written at various times between 30 and 26 his first love , the subject of book i tibullus 's suit was favoured by delia 's mother , of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms ( i sometimes she appears as single , sometimes as married ; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband 's death yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in cilicia which gave tibullus the opportunity to see her , and he continued to do so when the husband returned his entreaties and appeals were of no avail ; and after the first book no more is heard of delia in addition , several elegies in book i concern themselves with tibullus 's love for a boy , who is named marathus the three poems centered on marathus constitute the longest poetic project in roman literature having homosexual love as theme the first of these poems , 1.4 , begins with an imprecation of the poet to the god priapus , asking for advice on how to win over beautiful boys at first the narrator of the poem presents himself as someone who is simply asking for advice from the god on behalf of a friend who fell in love with a boy but whose wife forbids such affairs ( 1.4.73 ) the cycle is resumed in poem 1.8 , in which the narrator learns that marathus is in love with a girl in the poem that ends the cycle , 1.9 , the narrator discovers that marathus is in a relationship with a much older married man who buys the young man 's affections through expensive gifts he turns to the rival , taking revenge on him for having stolen her boyfriend by describing in detail the affair that the rival 's wife is herself having with another boy ( 1.9.54–58 and 65–74 ) about the second book , scholars can only say that in all likelihood it was published before the poet 's death in 19 bc nemesis ( like the cynthia of propertius ) was probably a courtesan of the higher class ; and she had other admirers besides tibullus ovid , writing at the time of tibullus 's death , says : ovid , amores , iii.9 , 31-32 it is worth noticing that martial selects nemesis as the source of tibullus 's reputation his ideal is a quiet retirement in the country with the loved one at his side tibullus is smoother and more musical , but liable to become monotonous ; propertius , with occasional harshnesses , is more vigorous and varied in many of tibullus 's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced it is unknown when his poems were added to the genuine poems of tibullus quotes part of a hexameter which is not found in the extant poems of tibullus the codex cuiacianus , a late manuscript containing catullus , tibullus and propertius , is still extant

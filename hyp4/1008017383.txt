tibullus 's chief friend and patron was marcus valerius messalla corvinus , himself an orator and poet as well as a statesman and a commander messalla , like gaius maecenas , was at the centre of a literary circle in rome this circle had no relationship with the court , and the name of augustus is found nowhere in the writings of tibullus about 30 bc messalla was dispatched by augustus to gaul to quell a rising in aquitania and restore order in the country , and tibullus may have been in his retinue tibullus had no liking for war , and though his life seems to have been divided between rome and his country estate , his own preferences were wholly for the country life the loss of tibullus 's landed property is attested by himself ( i.1 , 19 ) , as a farmer '' felicis quondam , nunc pauperis agri '' ( '' of a once fruitful , now impoverished field '' ; cf , a poem composed for messalla 's triumph ) , and may have received dona militaria ( vita tib tibullus died prematurely , probably in 19 , and almost immediately after virgil tibullus 's first book consists of poems written at various times between 30 and 26 his first love , the subject of book i for tibullus 's illness at corcyra , see i sometimes she appears as single , sometimes as married ; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband 's death yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in cilicia which gave tibullus the opportunity to see her , and he continued to do so when the husband returned in addition , several elegies in book i concern themselves with tibullus 's love for a boy , who is named marathus the first of these poems , 1.4 , begins with an imprecation of the poet to the god priapus , asking for advice on how to win over beautiful boys the god advises patience and that the man in love yield to the beloved boy 's every whim and perform a series of services if the boy demands it ( 1.4.15â€“53 ) he later portrays himself as a teacher in the affairs of love , declaring that the doors of his house are open for other men in love with boys to ask his advice ( 1.4.78 ) the cycle is resumed in poem 1.8 , in which the narrator learns that marathus is in love with a girl the narrator advises the girl to treat marathus with more leniency than marathus treated the narrator himself ( 1.8.49 ) in the second book the place of delia is taken by '' nemesis '' , which is also a fictitious name he complains bitterly of his bondage , and of her rapacity and hard-heartedness ovid , writing at the time of tibullus 's death , says : ovid , amores , iii.9 , 31-32 '' ( '' thus nemesis and delia will be long remembered : one tibullus ' recent love , the other his first it is worth noticing that martial selects nemesis as the source of tibullus 's reputation his tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients tibullus is smoother and more musical , but liable to become monotonous ; propertius , with occasional harshnesses , is more vigorous and varied quintilian says , quintilian , institutio oratoria x they are very short , only forty lines in all ; but they have a unique interest as being the only love poems by a roman woman that have survived the style and metrical handling was originally understood to be that of a novice , or a male poet appropriating female form there is little in it that we could not infer from tibullus himself and from what horace says about albius , though it is possible that its compiler may have taken some of his statements from suetonius 's book de poetis the codex cuiacianus , a late manuscript containing catullus , tibullus and propertius , is still extant

disillusioned knight antonius block and his cynical squire jöns return from the crusades to find the country ravaged by the plague the knight encounters death , whom he challenges to a chess match , believing he can survive as long as the game continues the knight and his squire pass a caravan of actors : jof and his wife mia , with their infant son mikael and actor-manager jonas skat in the confessional , block tells the priest he wants to perform '' one meaningful deed '' after what he now sees as a pointless life upon revealing to him the chess strategy that will save his life , the knight discovers that it is actually death with whom he has been speaking leaving the church , block speaks to a young woman condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the devil he believes she will tell him about life beyond death , only to find that she is insane in a deserted village , jöns saves a mute servant girl from being raped by raval , a theologian who ten years earlier persuaded the knight to join the crusades and is now a thief block enjoys a picnic of milk and strawberries that mia has gathered and declares , '' i 'll carry this memory between my hands as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk as the group moves on , skat climbs a tree to spend the night , but death appears beneath and cuts down the tree jof tells his wife that he can see the knight playing chess with death and decides to flee with his family , while block knowingly keeps death occupied '' jof and his family have sheltered in their caravan from a violent storm , which he interprets as the angel of death passing by in the morning , jof 's second sight allows him to see the knight and his companions being led away over the hillside in a wild dance of death ingmar bergman originally wrote the play trämålning ( wood painting ) in 1953 / 1954 for the acting students of malmö city theatre the script for the seventh seal was commenced while bergman was in the karolinska hospital in stockholm recovering from a stomach complaint bergman rewrote the script five times and was given a schedule of only thirty-five days and a budget of 150,000 assistants , electricians , and a make-up man and about two summer visitors , who never knew what it was all about , had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death bergman would probably counter that it was never his intention to make an historical or period film still , to be fair to bergman , one must allow him his artistic license , and the script 's modernisms may be justified as giving the movie 's medieval theme a compelling and urgent contemporary relevance yet the film succeeds to a large degree because it is set in the middle ages , a time that can seem both very remote and very immediate to us living in the modern world ultimately the seventh seal should be judged as a historical film by how well it combines the medieval and the modern for example , bergman has stated that the image of a man playing chess with a skeletal death was inspired by a medieval church painting from the 1480s in täby kyrka , täby , north of stockholm , painted by albertus pictor however , the medieval sweden portrayed in this movie includes creative anachronisms what is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but are n't able to ? '' death , impersonating the confessional priest , refuses to reply '' bergman 's international reputation , on the other hand , was largely cemented by the seventh seal the film was included in '' the new york times guide to the best 1,000 movies ever made '' in 2002 the film was selected as the swedish entry for the best foreign language film at the 30th academy awards , but was not nominated the seventh seal an essay by peter cowie at the criterion collection the seventh seal pdf the seventh seal opera

the skeleton originated in st & nbsp ; moritz , switzerland , as a spinoff of the popular british sport called cresta run although skeleton '' sliders '' use equipment similar to that of cresta '' riders '' , the two sports are different : while skeleton is run on the same track used by bobsleds and luge , cresta is run on cresta-specific sledding tracks only the cresta toboggan does not have a steering or braking mechanism , though cresta riders use rakes on their boots in addition to shifting body weight to help steer and brake the sport of skeleton can be traced to 1882 , when english soldiers constructed a toboggan track between the towns of davos and klosters in switzerland in 1884 , major william bulpett , with the backing of winter sports pioneer and kulm hotel owner caspar badrutt , constructed cresta run , the first sledding track of its kind in st & nbsp ; moritz in 1928 and 1948 , the cresta run was included in the program , marking the only two times skeleton was included as an olympic event before its permanent addition in 2002 to the winter games skeleton was practiced mainly in switzerland ; however , in 1905 , styria held its first skeleton competition in m√ºrzzuschlag , austria as the popularity of the sport grew , skeleton evolved into the sport recognized today the newly designed bare-bones sled resembled a human skeleton , and the sport adopted its modern name of skeleton , though it is still recognized as tobogganing in many countries soon afterward , in 1926 , the international olympic committee declared bobsleigh and skeleton as olympic sports and adopted the rules of the st it was not until 2002 , however , that skeleton returned to the olympic winter games after a 54-year absence , with the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city , utah the ibsf organizes four competitive circuits for international skeleton competition , in three tiers : two continental cups , the intercontinental cup ( icc ) , and the top level world cup the ibsf cooperates with the international olympic committee to supervise the skeleton races at the olympic winter games , and the ibsf ranking system is used to determine the national olympic committees ' athlete quota allocations normally , if the same competition also includes bobsleigh races , the skeleton races will be held first , as the heavier bobsleighs do more damage to the track the two continental cup series are the europe cup ( also called '' europa cup '' and '' european cup '' ) and the north american cup ) as the bottom level of international skeleton competition , race results in the continental cups are assigned the lowest point values for ranking , with a first-place finish being with 75 points ( compared to 120 points for the intercontinental cup and 225 points for the world cup ) however , two races are generally held in each discipline on a single race weekend , allowing consistently competitive athletes to earn a higher ranking than if they went to a single world cup race and finished poorly in order to be eligible to race in the icc , athletes must have received a ranking in at least five ibsf competitions at three different tracks in the previous two years the world cup is the top level of international skeleton competition , and has the most stringent team quotas , with no teams receiving an automatic entry in non-olympic years , a national federation volunteers to organize the ( senior ) world championships ( for both bobsleigh and skeleton ) , which are open to all athletes meeting the experience requirements that apply to the world cup and the icc ( including junior athletes ) fibt world championships list of skeleton world cup champions bobsleigh luge

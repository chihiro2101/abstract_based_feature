as the first second-generation battleship in the us navy , nevada has been described as '' revolutionary '' and '' as radical as was in her day '' by present-day historians nevada was the first battleship in the us navy to have triple gun turrets , a single funnel , and an oil-fired steam power plant in particular , the use of the more-efficient oil gave the ship an advantage over earlier coal-fired plants nevada was also the first us battleship with geared turbines , which also helped increase fuel economy and thus range compared to earlier direct drive turbines the ability to steam great distances without refueling was a major concern of the general board at that time one of the main purposes of the great white fleet , which sailed around the world in 1907â€“1908 , was to prove to japan that the us navy could '' carry any naval conflict into japanese home waters '' in addition to all of this , nevada had maximum armor over critical areas , such as the magazines and engines , and none over less important places , even though previous battleships had armor of varying thickness depending on the importance of the area it was protecting this radical change became known as the '' all or nothing '' principle , which most major navies later adopted for their own battleships as a result of all of these design modifications from previous battleships , nevada was the first of the us navy 's '' standard '' type battleships '' standards '' were characterized by the use of oil fuel , the '' all or nothing '' armor scheme , and the arrangement of the main armament in four triple or twin turrets without any turrets located in the middle of the ship the navy was to create a fleet of modern battleships similar in long-range gunnery , speed , turning radius , and protection nevada was followed by 11 other battleships of this type , although significant improvements were made in subsequent designs as naval technology rapidly progressed an additional seven standard type battleships and the six of the were never completed due to the washington naval treaty nevada and her sister were fitted with different engines to compare the two , putting them 'head-to-head ' : oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines , which had proven more fuel-efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships , while nevada received geared curtis steam turbines a secondary contract was signed on 31 july 1912 for 50,000 to cover the additional cost of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft ; this also extended the planned construction time by five months the launch was attended by several prominent members of the government , including governor oddie , governor david i walsh of massachusetts , senator key pittman of nevada , secretary of the navy josephus daniels and assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt , who would later become the 32nd president of the united states these began on 4 november 1915 , when the ship conducted a twelve-hour endurance run '' up and down the new england coast '' , reaching a top speed of though her '' acceptance trials '' were interrupted on 5 november because of a gale and rough seas , they were continued on the 6th with a test of her fuel economy ; this consisted of a 24-hour run where nevada steamed at the test results were positive : the oil consumption of the battlewagon was 6 & nbsp ; lb per knot lower than the contract had demanded after completing all of these tests and running trials off rockland , maine , nevada sailed to the boston and new york navy yards for equipment , torpedo tubes , and ammunition hoists when all of the preliminaries were completed , nevada was commissioned on 11 march 1916 at the charlestown navy yard , and william sims was the first captain of the new ship , followed by joseph strauss on 30 december 1916 prior to the united states ' entry into world war i , she conducted many training cruises and underwent many exercises out of her base in norfolk , virginia , sailing as far south as the caribbean on these cruises the us entered the war in april 1917 , but nevada was not sent to the other side of the atlantic because of a shortage of fuel oil in britain instead , four coal-fired battleships of battleship division 9 ( batdiv 9 ) , , , and departed the us to join the british grand fleet on 25 november 1917 long , left the us for britain , becoming the last american ship to join the fleet overseas between the two world wars , nevada , under the successive commands of thomas p though she had originally been equipped with 21 5 '' /51 caliber gun guns to defend against enemy destroyers , this number was reduced to 12 in 1918 , due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine nevada , then under command of luke mcnamee , and with the battleship , represented the united states at the peruvian centennial exposition in july 1921 aft of arizona during the attack , nevada was not moored alongside another battleship off ford island , and therefore was able to maneuver , unlike the other seven battleships present the officer of the deck , ensign joe taussig ( son of the joseph taussig ) , had earlier that morning ordered a second boiler lit off , planning to switch the power load from one boiler to the other around 0800 flooding the main magazine and counterflooding to keep the ship stable lowered the bow allowing water to enter the ship at the second deck level kingman , the overhaul was completed in october 1942 , and it changed the old battleship 's appearance so she slightly resembled a south dakota from a distance nevada supported this operation from 15 august to 25 september 1944 , '' dueling '' with '' big willie '' : a heavily reinforced fortress with four 340 mm ( 13.4 in ) guns in two twin turrets one plane , though hit repeatedly by antiaircraft fire from the force , crashed onto the main deck of nevada , next to turret no after she was thoroughly examined , and two other vessels used nevada as a practice gunnery target 65 miles southwest of pearl harbor on 31 july 1948 nevada is located at a depth of off the coast of hawaii and about 65 nautical miles southwest of pearl harbor

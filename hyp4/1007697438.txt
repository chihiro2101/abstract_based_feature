this consisted of a 24-hour run where nevada steamed at another test was conducted for 12 hours at , with an even better result of 10 & nbsp ; lb per knot lower than the contract specifications after completing all of these tests and running trials off rockland , maine , nevada sailed to the boston and new york navy yards for equipment , torpedo tubes , and ammunition hoists after fitting out in the boston and new york navy yards , nevada joined the atlantic fleet in newport , rhode island on 26 may 1916 instead , four coal-fired battleships of battleship division 9 ( batdiv 9 ) , , , and departed the us to join the british grand fleet on 25 november 1917 long , left the us for britain , becoming the last american ship to join the fleet overseas they took less than two weeks to cross the atlantic , and arrived in new york on 26 december to parades and celebrations between the two world wars , nevada , under the successive commands of thomas p nevada , then under command of luke mcnamee , and with the battleship , represented the united states at the peruvian centennial exposition in july 1921 royall took over command during this period work on the ship included exchange of her lattice mast for tripod masts and her steam turbines for those from the recently stricken battleship nevada then served in the pacific fleet for the next eleven years normally they took turns spending time in port , six would be out with vice admiral william s pye 's battleship task force one one weekend , while the next weekend would find three ranging with vice admiral william halsey , jr her damage control crew corrected the list by counter-flooding and nevada got underway at 0840 , her gunners already having shot down four planes file : uss nevada normandy.jpg a view looking down uss nevada ( bb-36 ) at a 5in/38cal gun and quad 40mm bofors mount however , after the fire support ships retired for the night , dawn '' came up like thunder '' when seven kamikazes attacked the force while it was without air cover one plane , though hit repeatedly by antiaircraft fire from the force , crashed onto the main deck of nevada , next to turret no after she was thoroughly examined , and two other vessels used nevada as a practice gunnery target 65 miles southwest of pearl harbor on 31 july 1948 video : research groups find wreck of 'unsinkable battleship ' uss nevada

this also extended the planned construction time by five months nevada was launched on 11 july 1914 ; she was sponsored by miss eleanor anne seibert , niece of governor tasker oddie of nevada and a descendant of the first secretary of the navy , benjamin stoddert walsh of massachusetts , senator key pittman of nevada , secretary of the navy josephus daniels and assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt , who would later become the 32nd president of the united states these began on 4 november 1915 , when the ship conducted a twelve-hour endurance run '' up and down the new england coast '' , reaching a top speed of though her '' acceptance trials '' were interrupted on 5 november because of a gale and rough seas , they were continued on the 6th with a test of her fuel economy ; this consisted of a 24-hour run where nevada steamed at nevada ii ( battleship no after fitting out in the boston and new york navy yards , nevada joined the atlantic fleet in newport , rhode island on 26 may 1916 the us entered the war in april 1917 , but nevada was not sent to the other side of the atlantic because of a shortage of fuel oil in britain long , left the us for britain , becoming the last american ship to join the fleet overseas after a 10-day voyage , she arrived in berehaven , ireland , on 23 august along with and her sister , the three were nicknamed the '' bantry bay squadron '' ;

one passed out through the side of the second deck before exploding , but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank ; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship flooding the main magazine and counterflooding to keep the ship stable lowered the bow allowing water to enter the ship at the second deck level in addition , they were fortified with heavy armor plate embedded into the rocky sides of the saint-mandrier-sur-mer on 24 march 1945 , nevada joined task force 54 ( tf 54 ) , the '' fire support force '' , off okinawa as bombardment began prior to the battle of okinawa as a result , she was assigned to be a target ship in the first bikini atomic experiments ( operation crossroads ) of july 1946 after she was thoroughly examined , and two other vessels used nevada as a practice gunnery target 65 miles southwest of pearl harbor on 31 july 1948 nevada is located at a depth of off the coast of hawaii and about 65 nautical miles southwest of pearl harbor

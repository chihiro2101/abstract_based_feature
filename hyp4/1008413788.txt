the adjective eurocentric , or europe-centric , has been in use in various contexts since at least the 1920s the german adjective europa-zentrisch ( '' europe-centric '' ) is attested in the 1920s , unrelated to the marxist context of amin 's usage the term was popularised ( in french as européocentrique ) in the context of decolonization and internationalism in the mid-20th century ( de centrique ) « qui fait référence à l'europe » et européocentrisme n.m 1974 ) « fait de considérer ( un problème général , mondial ) d'un point de vue européen » '' english usage of eurocentric as an ideological term in identity politics was current by the mid-1980s the -ism eurocentrism ( french eurocentrisme , earlier europocentrisme ) as the term for an ideology was coined in the 1970s by the egyptian marxian economist samir amin , then director of the african institute for economic development and planning of the united nations economic commission for africa amin used the term in the context of a global , core-periphery or dependency model of capitalist development enders wimbush , muslim national communism in the soviet union : a revolutionary strategy for the colonial world ( 1979 ) , p during the european colonialism , encyclopedias often sought to give a rationale for the predominance of european rule during the colonial period by referring to a special position taken by europe compared to the other continents thus , johann heinrich zedler , in 1741 , wrote that '' even though europe is the smallest of the four continents , it has for various reasons a position that places it before all others european exceptionalism is widely reflected in popular genres of literature , especially literature for young adults ( for example , rudyard kipling 's kim ) and adventure literature in general daniel iwerks , '' ideology and eurocentrism in tarzan of the apes , '' in : investigating the unliterary : six readings of edgar rice burroughs ' tarzan of the apes , ed the european miracle , a term coined by eric jones in 1981 , refers to this surprising rise of europe during the early modern period china replaced the real historically development with a fixed , stable scenario , which makes it the outsider of world history both india and china were waiting and anticipating a combination of certain factors from outside until they can acquire real progress in human civilization some scholars disagree with his ideas that the oriental countries were outside of world history weber wrote many treatises to publicize the distinctiveness of europe even the state , with a written constitution and a government organized by trained administrators and constrained by rational law , only appear in the west , even though other regimes can also comprise states rationality is a multi-layered term whose connotations are developed and escalated as with the social progress weber regarded rationality as a proprietary article for western capitalist society even in the 19th century , anticolonial movements had developed claims about national traditions and values that were set against those of europe in africa and india in some cases , as china , where local ideology was even more exclusionist than the eurocentric one , westernisation did not overwhelm longstanding chinese attitudes to its own cultural centrality , but some would state that idea itself is a rather desperate attempt to cast europe in a good light by comparison toynbee also drew attention in europe to non-european historians , such as the medieval tunisian scholar ibn khaldun eurocentrism has been a particularly important concept in development studies eurocentrism and the dualistic properties that it labels on non-european countries , cultures and persons have often been criticized in the political discourse of the 1990s and 2000s , particularly in the greater context of political correctness , race in the united states and affirmative action a better ( if still imperfect ) analogy would compare france , not to india as a whole , but to a single indian state , such as uttar pradesh he criticized some western scholars for their ideas that non-western areas lack outstanding contributions in history , economy , ideology , politics and culture compared with the west these scholars believed that the same contribution made by the west gives westerners an advantage of endo-genetic momentum which is pushed towards the rest of the world , but frank believed that the oriental countries also contributed to the human civilization in their own perspectives he believed that although western capitalism shrouded the world and achieved a political unity based on its economy , the western countries can not '' westernize '' other countries toynbee concluded that eurocentrism is characteristic of three misconceptions manifested by self-centerment , the fixed development of oriental countries and linear progress there has been some debate on whether historical eurocentrism qualifies as '' just another ethnocentrism '' , as it is found in most of the world 's cultures , especially in cultures with imperial aspirations , as in the sinocentrism in china ; in the empire of japan ( c blaut ( 2000 ) argued that eurocentrism indeed went beyond other ethnocentrisms , as the scale of european colonial expansion was historically unprecedented and resulted in the formation of a '' colonizer 's model of the world '' linco state that '' in some ways , the epistemological critique initiated by indigenous knowledge is more radical than other sociopolitical critiques of the west , for the indigenous critique questions the very foundations of western ways of knowing and being in its quest for certainty , western philosophy continues to generate what it imagines to be colorless and genderless accounts of knowledge , reality , morality , and human nature '' eze , race and the enlightenment : a reader ( blackwell , 1997 ) luke clossey and nicholas guyatt have measured the degree of eurocentrism in the research programs of top history departments this occurred through the application of new criteria meant to '' impose a new social classification

laughter out of place : race , class , violence , and sexuality in a rio shantytown also addresses how whiteness influences beauty in brazil challenging these standards of beauty in brazil would require society to '' question the romantic and sexual appeal of whiteness '' deliovsky addresses eurocentrism and whiteness in relation to beauty in her article '' normative white femininity : race ,

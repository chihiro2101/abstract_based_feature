the word idolatry comes from the greek word eidololatria ( εἰδωλολατρία ) which itself is a compound of two words : eidolon ( εἴδωλον '' image '' ) and latreia ( λατρεία '' worship '' , related to λάτρις ) the word eidololatria thus means '' worship of idols '' , which in latin appears first as idololatria , then in vulgar latin as idolatria , therefrom it appears in 12th century old french as idolatrie , which for the first time in mid 13th century english appears as '' idolatry '' the original term used in early rabbinic writings is oved avodah zarah ( aaz , worship of avoda zara , or '' pagan '' ) , while avodat kochavim umazalot ( akum , worship of planets and constellations ) is not found in its early manuscripts ; see john calvin ( 1537 ) the institutes of the christian religion , quote : '' the worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of εἰδωλοδυλεία ( idolodulia ) , and deny to be εἰδωλολατϱεία ( idolatria ) so they speak , holding that the worship which they call dulia may , without insult to god , be paid to statues and pictures ) for the greek word λατϱεύειν having no other meaning than to worship , what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they worship their images without worshipping them ( 1965 ) , pages 72–86 ( in german ) the earliest historic records confirming cult images are from the ancient egyptian civilization , thereafter related to the greek civilization by the 2nd millennium bc two broad forms of cult image appear , in one images are zoomorphic ( god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion ) and in another anthropomorphic ( god in the image of man ) the stele from 4,000 to 2,500 bc period discovered in france , ireland through ukraine , and in central asia through south asia , suggest that the ancient anthropomorphic figures included zoomorphic motifs in the jewish belief , the only image of god is man , one who lives and thinks ; god has no visible shape , and it is absurd to make or worship images ; instead man must worship the invisible god alone the commandments in the hebrew bible against idolatry forbade the practices and gods of ancient akkad , mesopotamia , and egypt this biblical polemics , states naomi janowitz , a professor of religious studies , has distorted the reality of israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in judaism the history of jewish religious practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory , terracotta , faience and seals the material evidence of images , statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and '' wine standing for blood '' , for example , suggests that symbolism , making religious images , icon and index has been integral part of judaism awolalu , proselytizing christians and muslims have mislabelled idol to mean false god , when in the reality of most traditions of africa , the object may be a piece of wood or iron or stone , yet it is '' symbolic , an emblem and implies the spiritual idea which is worshipped '' the aztec indians , however , preserved their religion and religious practices by burying their idols under the crosses , and then continuing their idol worship rituals and practices , aided by the syncretic composite of atrial crosses and their idols as before during and after the imposition of catholic christianity during spanish empire , the incan people retained their original beliefs in deities through syncretism , where they overlay the christian god and teachings over their original beliefs and practices yehezkel kaufman ( 1960 ) states that the biblical prohibition of idolatry relates to the belief where the idols are considered gods allegations that idols only represent false gods , followed by violence and iconoclastic destruction , state regina schwartz and other scholars , is little more than religious intolerance

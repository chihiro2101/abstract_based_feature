the word idolatry comes from the greek word eidololatria ( εἰδωλολατρία ) which itself is a compound of two words : eidolon ( εἴδωλον '' image '' ) and latreia ( λατρεία '' worship '' , related to λάτρις ) ; see john calvin ( 1537 ) the institutes of the christian religion , quote : '' the worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of εἰδωλοδυλεία ( idolodulia ) , and deny to be εἰδωλολατϱεία ( idolatria ) so they speak , holding that the worship which they call dulia may , without insult to god , be paid to statues and pictures ) for the greek word λατϱεύειν having no other meaning than to worship , what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they worship their images without worshipping them 69 ( 1974 ) , pages 103–107 jürgen thimme ( 1965 ) , die religiöse bedeutung der kykladenidole , antike kunst , 8 by the 2nd millennium bc two broad forms of cult image appear , in one images are zoomorphic ( god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion ) and in another anthropomorphic ( god in the image of man ) the former is more commonly found in ancient egypt influenced beliefs , while the anthropomorphic images are more commonly found in indo-european cultures ancient greek civilization preferred human forms , with idealized proportions , for divine representation the ancient philosophy and practices of the greeks , thereafter romans , were imbued with polytheistic idolatry to aristotle , states paul kugler , an image is an appropriate mental intermediary that '' bridges between the inner world of the mind and the outer world of material reality '' , the image is a vehicle between sensation and reason many jewish scholars such as rabbi saadia gaon , rabbi bahya ibn paquda , and rabbi yehuda halevi have elaborated on the issues of idolatry in the jewish belief , the only image of god is man , one who lives and thinks ; god has no visible shape , and it is absurd to make or worship images ; instead man must worship the invisible god alone the tanakh states that god has no shape or form , is utterly incomparable , is everywhere and can not be represented in a physical form of an idol the direct material evidence is more reliable , such as that from the archaeological sites , and this suggests that the jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest nonetheless , these sorts of evidence may be simply descriptive of ancient israelite practices in some—possibly deviant—circles , but can not tell us anything about the mainstream religion of the bible which proscribes idolatry idols and their worship have been associated with all three components in the african traditional religions the incan , mayan and aztec civilizations developed sophisticated religious practices that incorporated idols and religious arts yehezkel kaufman ( 1960 ) states that the biblical prohibition of idolatry relates to the belief where the idols are considered gods idolatry and iconoclasm , tufts university iconoclasm and idolatry , columbia university

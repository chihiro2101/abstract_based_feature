the word idolatry comes from the greek word eidololatria ( εἰδωλολατρία ) which itself is a compound of two words : eidolon ( εἴδωλον '' image '' ) and latreia ( λατρεία '' worship '' , related to λάτρις ) the word eidololatria thus means '' worship of idols '' , which in latin appears first as idololatria , then in vulgar latin as idolatria , therefrom it appears in 12th century old french as idolatrie , which for the first time in mid 13th century english appears as '' idolatry '' douglas harper ( 2015 ) , etymology dictionary , idolatry although the greek appears to be a calque of the hebrew phrase avodat elilim , which is attested in rabbinic literature ( e.g ; see john calvin ( 1537 ) the institutes of the christian religion , quote : '' the worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of εἰδωλοδυλεία ( idolodulia ) , and deny to be εἰδωλολατϱεία ( idolatria ) ) for the greek word λατϱεύειν having no other meaning than to worship , what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they worship their images without worshipping them ( 1965 ) , pages 72–86 ( in german ) the earliest historic records confirming cult images are from the ancient egyptian civilization , thereafter related to the greek civilization by the 2nd millennium bc two broad forms of cult image appear , in one images are zoomorphic ( god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion ) and in another anthropomorphic ( god in the image of man ) the ancient philosophy and practices of the greeks , thereafter romans , were imbued with polytheistic idolatry fervid opposition to the idolatry of the greeks and romans was of early christianity and later islam , as evidenced by the widespread desecration and defacement of ancient greek and roman sculptures that have survived into the modern era one of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of rabbi moshe ben maimon ( maimonides ) on idolatry the tanakh states that god has no shape or form , is utterly incomparable , is everywhere and can not be represented in a physical form of an idol this biblical polemics , states naomi janowitz , a professor of religious studies , has distorted the reality of israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in judaism the direct material evidence is more reliable , such as that from the archaeological sites , and this suggests that the jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest nonetheless , these sorts of evidence may be simply descriptive of ancient israelite practices in some—possibly deviant—circles , but can not tell us anything about the mainstream religion of the bible which proscribes idolatry the history of jewish religious practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory , terracotta , faience and seals the claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in jewish literature and therefrom in biblical christian literature , states janowitz , has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history the violence against idolaters and idolatry of traditional religion practicers of africa started in the medieval era and continued into the modern era the male deity inti became accepted as the christian god , but the andean rituals centered around idolatry of incan deities have been retained and continued thereafter into the modern era by the incan people the christian missionaries , particularly from the london missionary society such as john williams , and others such as the methodist missionary society , characterized these as idolatry , in the sense of islanders worshipping false gods

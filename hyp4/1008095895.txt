the word idolatry comes from the greek word eidololatria ( εἰδωλολατρία ) which itself is a compound of two words : eidolon ( εἴδωλον '' image '' ) and latreia ( λατρεία '' worship '' , related to λάτρις ) the word eidololatria thus means '' worship of idols '' , which in latin appears first as idololatria , then in vulgar latin as idolatria , therefrom it appears in 12th century old french as idolatrie , which for the first time in mid 13th century english appears as '' idolatry '' the original term used in early rabbinic writings is oved avodah zarah ( aaz , worship of avoda zara , or '' pagan '' ) , while avodat kochavim umazalot ( akum , worship of planets and constellations ) is not found in its early manuscripts ; see john calvin ( 1537 ) the institutes of the christian religion , quote : '' the worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of εἰδωλοδυλεία ( idolodulia ) , and deny to be εἰδωλολατϱεία ( idolatria ) ) for the greek word λατϱεύειν having no other meaning than to worship , what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they worship their images without worshipping them ( 1965 ) , pages 72–86 ( in german ) the earliest historic records confirming cult images are from the ancient egyptian civilization , thereafter related to the greek civilization by the 2nd millennium bc two broad forms of cult image appear , in one images are zoomorphic ( god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion ) and in another anthropomorphic ( god in the image of man ) the ancient philosophy and practices of the greeks , thereafter romans , were imbued with polytheistic idolatry to aristotle , states paul kugler , an image is an appropriate mental intermediary that '' bridges between the inner world of the mind and the outer world of material reality '' , the image is a vehicle between sensation and reason according to the maimonidean interpretation , idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin , but the grave sin is the belief that god can be corporeal in the jewish belief , the only image of god is man , one who lives and thinks ; god has no visible shape , and it is absurd to make or worship images ; instead man must worship the invisible god alone the direct material evidence is more reliable , such as that from the archaeological sites , and this suggests that the jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest judaism included images and cultic statues in the first temple period , the second temple period , late antiquity ( 2nd to 8th century ce ) , and thereafter nonetheless , these sorts of evidence may be simply descriptive of ancient israelite practices in some—possibly deviant—circles , but can not tell us anything about the mainstream religion of the bible which proscribes idolatry the material evidence of images , statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and '' wine standing for blood '' , for example , suggests that symbolism , making religious images , icon and index has been integral part of judaism idols and their worship have been associated with all three components in the african traditional religions the aztec indians , however , preserved their religion and religious practices by burying their idols under the crosses , and then continuing their idol worship rituals and practices , aided by the syncretic composite of atrial crosses and their idols as before the pagan priests beseeched their god without the use of an idol , which is evidence that baal was not an idol , but rather one of the polytheistic gods that merely could be worshipped with or without the use of an idol allegations that idols only represent false gods , followed by violence and iconoclastic destruction , state regina schwartz and other scholars , is little more than religious intolerance

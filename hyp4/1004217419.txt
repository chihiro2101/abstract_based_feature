acute pain may occur due to trauma , surgery , infection , disruption of blood circulation , or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs besides improving patient comfort , pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter la drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action some typical uses of conduction anesthesia for acute pain are : labor pain ( epidural anesthesia , pudendal nerve blocks ) postoperative pain ( peripheral nerve blocks , epidural anesthesia ) trauma ( peripheral nerve blocks , intravenous regional anesthesia , epidural anesthesia ) las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits however , only a limited number of techniques are in common clinical use sometimes , conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient 's comfort and ease of surgery however , many anaesthetists , surgeons , patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia diagnostic tests such as bone marrow aspiration , lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) and aspiration of cysts or other structures are made to be less painful upon administration of local anesthetic before insertion of larger needles local anesthesia is also used during insertion of iv devices , such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators , ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters topical anesthesia , in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla ) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture ( blood collection ) and placement of intravenous cannulae edema of tongue , pharynx and larynx may develop as a side effect of local anaesthesia this is due to puncturing of the vein which allows the blood to flow into loose tissues in the surrounding area this gives the area a white appearance as the blood flow is prevented due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the area the side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense , clenching of the fists and moaning the duration of soft tissue anaesthesia is longer than pulpal anaesthesia and is often associated with difficulty eating , drinking and speaking there is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution giving local anaesthesia to patients with liver disease can have significant consequences an estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage symptoms may continue to improve for up to 18 months following injury general systemic adverse effects are due to the pharmacological effects of the anesthetic agents used the effects of local anesthetics are , therefore , not specific for the signal conduction in peripheral nerves high plasma levels might arise , for example , when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection what results is a dilation of arteries in muscles which can lead to a reduction in circulating blood volume inducing a temporary shortness of blood flow to the brain notable symptoms include restlessness , visibly looking pale , perspiration and possible the loss of consciousness hence , it is crucial for the medical professional administrating the local anaesthesia , especially in the form of an injection , to ensure that the patient is in a comfortable setting and has any potential fears alleviated in order to avoid these possible complications depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics , excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur a profound depression of brain functions may occur at even higher concentrations which may lead to coma , respiratory arrest , and death even with proper administration , it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient cardiac toxicity associated with overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic is characterized by hypotension , atrioventricular conduction delay , idioventricular rhythms , and eventual cardiovascular collapse although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period , bupivacaine blocks the cardiac sodium channels , thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias of wisconsin , local anesthesia and regional anesthetics therefore , amides can be used as alternatives in those patients application of local anesthetics during oocyte removal during in vitro fertilisation has been up to debate during pregnancy , it is not common for local anesthetics to have any adverse effect on the fetus despite this , risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system evidence indicates intralipid , a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion , can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anesthetic overdose , including human case reports of successful use in this way ( lipid rescue ) once inside the cell , the local anesthetic will be in equilibrium , with the formation of the protonated ( ionized ) form , which does not readily pass back out of the cell small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually ( peripheral nerve block ) or in anatomic nerve bundles ( plexus anesthesia ) infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of la into the tissue to be anesthetized ; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia field block is subcutaneous injection of an la in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized plexus anesthesia is injection of la in the vicinity of a nerve plexus , often inside a tissue compartment that limits the diffusion of the drug away from the intended site of action in peru , the ancient incas are believed to have used the leaves of the coca as a local anaesthetic in addition to its stimulant properties this technique is still in use and is remarkably safe when drugs of low systemic toxicity such as prilocaine are used amylocaine anesthetic general anesthetic list of cocaine analogues list of local anesthetics

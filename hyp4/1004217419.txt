acute pain may occur due to trauma , surgery , infection , disruption of blood circulation , or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs besides improving patient comfort , pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter la drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action some typical uses of conduction anesthesia for acute pain are : labor pain ( epidural anesthesia , pudendal nerve blocks ) postoperative pain ( peripheral nerve blocks , epidural anesthesia ) trauma ( peripheral nerve blocks , intravenous regional anesthesia , epidural anesthesia ) chronic pain is a complex and often serious condition that requires diagnosis and treatment by an expert in pain medicine las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia however , only a limited number of techniques are in common clinical use sometimes , conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient 's comfort and ease of surgery however , many anaesthetists , surgeons , patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia surface anesthesia also facilitates some endoscopy procedures such as bronchoscopy ( visualization of the lower airways ) or cystoscopy ( visualization of the inner surface of the bladder ) edema of tongue , pharynx and larynx may develop as a side effect of local anaesthesia this could be caused by a variety of reasons including trauma during injection , infection , an allergic reaction , haematoma or injection of irritating solutions such as cold-sterilisation solutions blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anaesthetic is deposited is also common the side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense , clenching of the fists and moaning the duration of soft tissue anaesthesia is longer than pulpal anaesthesia and is often associated with difficulty eating , drinking and speaking the risk of temporary or permanent nerve damage varies between different locations and types of nerve blocks there is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution the density of tissues surrounding the injured vessels is an important factor for haematoma giving local anaesthesia to patients with liver disease can have significant consequences consultation with the obstetrician is vital before administrating any type of local anaesthetic to a pregnant patient an estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage general systemic adverse effects are due to the pharmacological effects of the anesthetic agents used the conduction of electric impulses follows a similar mechanism in peripheral nerves , the central nervous system , and the heart side effects on the central nervous system and the heart may be severe and potentially fatal high plasma levels might arise , for example , when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection this is the anticipation of pain during administration that activates the parasympathetic nervous system while inhibiting the orthosympathetic nervous system on the other hand , fear of administration can also result in accelerated , shallow breathing , or hyperventilation depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics , excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur initial symptoms of systemic toxicity include ringing in the ears ( tinnitus ) , a metallic taste in the mouth , tingling or numbness of the mouth , dizziness and/or disorientation , overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia this may affect the nervous system or cause the agent to enter into general circulation although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period , bupivacaine blocks the cardiac sodium channels , thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias of wisconsin , local anesthesia and regional anesthetics therefore , amides can be used as alternatives in those patients in some cases , skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur , which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions hence , it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications all nerve fibers are sensitive to las , but due to a combination of diameter and myelination , fibers have different sensitivities to la blockade , termed differential blockade although type b fibers are thicker than type c fibers , they are myelinated , thus are blocked before the unmyelinated , thin c fiber a number of methods can be used to decrease this pain , including buffering of the solution with bicarbonate and warming peripheral nerve block is injection of la in the vicinity of a peripheral nerve to anesthetize that nerve 's area of innervation since then , several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use , notably lidocaine in 1943 , bupivacaine in 1957 , and prilocaine in 1959 within a few years , spinal anesthesia became widely used for surgical anesthesia and was accepted as a safe and effective technique

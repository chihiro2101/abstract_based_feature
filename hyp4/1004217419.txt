acute pain may occur due to trauma , surgery , infection , disruption of blood circulation , or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs in a medical setting , pain alleviation is desired when its warning function is no longer needed besides improving patient comfort , pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter la drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action low doses of la drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized chronic pain is a complex and often serious condition that requires diagnosis and treatment by an expert in pain medicine las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia sometimes , conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient 's comfort and ease of surgery however , many anaesthetists , surgeons , patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia local anesthesia is also used during insertion of iv devices , such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators , ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anaesthetic is deposited is also common the vasoconstriction stimulus gradually wears off and subsequently the tissue returns to normal in less than 2 hours the side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense , clenching of the fists and moaning the risk of temporary or permanent nerve damage varies between different locations and types of nerve blocks there is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution thorough evaluation of the disease should be carried out to assess potential risk to the patient as in significant liver dysfunction , the half-life of amide local anaesthetic agents may be drastically increased thus increasing the risk of overdose consultation with the obstetrician is vital before administrating any type of local anaesthetic to a pregnant patient permanent nerve damage after a peripheral nerve block is rare an estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage symptoms may continue to improve for up to 18 months following injury however , toxicity usually occurs only at plasma levels which are rarely reached if proper anesthetic techniques are adhered to high plasma levels might arise , for example , when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection notable symptoms include restlessness , visibly looking pale , perspiration and possible the loss of consciousness depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics , excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur initial symptoms of systemic toxicity include ringing in the ears ( tinnitus ) , a metallic taste in the mouth , tingling or numbness of the mouth , dizziness and/or disorientation such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose another possibility is direct exposure of the central nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid , i.e , overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia even with proper administration , it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient cardiac toxicity associated with overdose of intravascular injection of local anesthetic is characterized by hypotension , atrioventricular conduction delay , idioventricular rhythms , and eventual cardiovascular collapse toxicity from anesthetic combinations is additive endocrine and metabolic systems only have slightly adverse effects with most cases being without clinical repercussions adverse reactions to local anesthetics ( especially the esters ) are not uncommon , but legitimate allergy are very rare of wisconsin , local anesthesia and regional anesthetics therefore , amides can be used as alternatives in those patients in some cases , skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of allergy despite this , risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system hence , it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually ( peripheral nerve block ) or in anatomic nerve bundles ( plexus anesthesia ) infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of la into the tissue to be anesthetized ; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia field block is subcutaneous injection of an la in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized as vazirani-akinosi is a local anaesthetic technique which requires penetration of a significant thickness of soft tissues , a long needle is used all three oral sensory parts of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and other sensory nerves in the region will come in contact with the anesthetic and this reduces the need to anesthetise supplementary innervation amylocaine anesthetic general anesthetic list of

acute pain may occur due to trauma , surgery , infection , disruption of blood circulation , or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs besides improving patient comfort , pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain acute pain can often be managed using analgesics however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter la drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action low doses of la drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia sometimes , conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient 's comfort and ease of surgery however , many anaesthetists , surgeons , patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia local anesthesia is also used during insertion of iv devices , such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators , ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters topical anesthesia , in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla ) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture ( blood collection ) and placement of intravenous cannulae blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anaesthetic is deposited is also common this gives the area a white appearance as the blood flow is prevented due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the area the side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense , clenching of the fists and moaning the risk of temporary or permanent nerve damage varies between different locations and types of nerve blocks there is greatest chance of this occurring in a posterior superior alveolar nerve block or in a pterygomandibular block lidocaine can be safely used but bupivacaine and mepivacaine should be avoided the effects of local anesthetics are , therefore , not specific for the signal conduction in peripheral nerves however , toxicity usually occurs only at plasma levels which are rarely reached if proper anesthetic techniques are adhered to high plasma levels might arise , for example , when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection this is the anticipation of pain during administration that activates the parasympathetic nervous system while inhibiting the orthosympathetic nervous system what results is a dilation of arteries in muscles which can lead to a reduction in circulating blood volume inducing a temporary shortness of blood flow to the brain notable symptoms include restlessness , visibly looking pale , perspiration and possible the loss of consciousness depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics , excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur initial symptoms of systemic toxicity include ringing in the ears ( tinnitus ) , a metallic taste in the mouth , tingling or numbness of the mouth , dizziness and/or disorientation such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose another possibility is direct exposure of the central nervous system through the cerebrospinal fluid , i.e , overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia this may affect the nervous system or cause the agent to enter into general circulation toxicity from anesthetic combinations is additive endocrine and metabolic systems only have slightly adverse effects with most cases being without clinical repercussions of wisconsin , local anesthesia and regional anesthetics therefore , amides can be used as alternatives in those patients also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur , which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions pharmacological concentrations of anesthetic agents have been found in follicular fluid during pregnancy , it is not common for local anesthetics to have any adverse effect on the fetus hence , it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications the receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic ( inner ) portion of the sodium channel local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state , thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons clinical techniques include : surface anesthesia is the application of an la spray , solution , or cream to the skin or a mucous membrane ; the effect is short lasting and is limited to the area of contact ilis are usually administered when inferior alveolar nerve block techniques are inadequate or ineffective if epinephrine is used , then sodium metabisulfite is used as a reducing agent preservative , e.g cocaine was first used as a local anesthetic in 1884 { shortly after the first use of cocaine for topical anesthesia , blocks on peripheral nerves were described

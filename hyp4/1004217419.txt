acute pain may occur due to trauma , surgery , infection , disruption of blood circulation , or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs besides improving patient comfort , pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter la drugs are also often combined with other agents such as opioids for synergistic analgesic action low doses of la drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized some typical uses of conduction anesthesia for acute pain are : labor pain ( epidural anesthesia , pudendal nerve blocks ) postoperative pain ( peripheral nerve blocks , epidural anesthesia ) trauma ( peripheral nerve blocks , intravenous regional anesthesia , epidural anesthesia ) chronic pain is a complex and often serious condition that requires diagnosis and treatment by an expert in pain medicine las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits however , only a limited number of techniques are in common clinical use however , many anaesthetists , surgeons , patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia local anesthesia is also used during insertion of iv devices , such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators , ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters surface anesthesia also facilitates some endoscopy procedures such as bronchoscopy ( visualization of the lower airways ) or cystoscopy ( visualization of the inner surface of the bladder ) edema of tongue , pharynx and larynx may develop as a side effect of local anaesthesia blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anaesthetic is deposited is also common the side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense , clenching of the fists and moaning there is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution giving local anaesthesia to patients with liver disease can have significant consequences thorough evaluation of the disease should be carried out to assess potential risk to the patient as in significant liver dysfunction , the half-life of amide local anaesthetic agents may be drastically increased thus increasing the risk of overdose local anaesthetics and vasoconstrictors may be administered to pregnant patients however it is very important to be extra cautious when giving a pregnant patient any type of drug permanent nerve damage after a peripheral nerve block is rare an estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage symptoms may continue to improve for up to 18 months following injury the conduction of electric impulses follows a similar mechanism in peripheral nerves , the central nervous system , and the heart the effects of local anesthetics are , therefore , not specific for the signal conduction in peripheral nerves side effects on the central nervous system and the heart may be severe and potentially fatal however , toxicity usually occurs only at plasma levels which are rarely reached if proper anesthetic techniques are adhered to depending on local tissue concentrations of local anesthetics , excitatory or depressant effects on the central nervous system may occur such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose , overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia even with proper administration , it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient this may affect the nervous system or cause the agent to enter into general circulation although all local anesthetics potentially shorten the myocardial refractory period , bupivacaine blocks the cardiac sodium channels , thereby making it most likely to precipitate malignant arrhythmias even levobupivacaine and ropivacaine ( single-enantiomer derivatives ) , developed to ameliorate cardiovascular side effects , still harbor the potential to disrupt cardiac function endocrine and metabolic systems only have slightly adverse effects with most cases being without clinical repercussions of wisconsin , local anesthesia and regional anesthetics therefore , amides can be used as alternatives in those patients also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur , which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions application of local anesthetics during oocyte removal during in vitro fertilisation has been up to debate despite this , risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system hence , it is recommended that pregnant women use a lower dose of local anesthetic to reduce any potential complications clinical techniques include : surface anesthesia is the application of an la spray , solution , or cream to the skin or a mucous membrane ; the effect is short lasting and is limited to the area of contact gow-gates technique is used to provide anesthetics to the mandible of the patient 's mouth in comparison to other regional block methods of anestheising the lower jaw , the gow-gates technique has a higher success rate in fully anesthetising the lower jaw cocaine was first used as a local anesthetic in 1884 amylocaine anesthetic general anesthetic list of cocaine analogues list of local anesthetics

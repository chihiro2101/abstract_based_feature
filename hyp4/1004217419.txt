acute pain may occur due to trauma , surgery , infection , disruption of blood circulation , or many other conditions in which tissue injury occurs besides improving patient comfort , pain therapy can also reduce harmful physiological consequences of untreated pain however , conduction anesthesia may be preferable because of superior pain control and fewer side effects for purposes of pain therapy , la drugs are often given by repeated injection or continuous infusion through a catheter low doses of la drugs can be sufficient so that muscle weakness does not occur and patients may be mobilized chronic pain is a complex and often serious condition that requires diagnosis and treatment by an expert in pain medicine las can be applied repeatedly or continuously for prolonged periods to relieve chronic pain , usually in combination with medication such as opioids , nsaids , and anticonvulsants though it can be easily performed , repeated local anaesthetic blocks in chronic pain conditions are not recommended as there is no evidence of long-term benefits virtually every part of the body can be anesthetized using conduction anesthesia sometimes , conduction anesthesia is combined with general anesthesia or sedation for the patient 's comfort and ease of surgery however , many anaesthetists , surgeons , patients and nurses believe that it is safer to perform major surgeries under local anesthesia than general anesthesia local anesthesia is also used during insertion of iv devices , such as pacemakers and implantable defibrillators , ports used for giving chemotherapy medications and hemodialysis access catheters topical anesthesia , in the form of lidocaine/prilocaine ( emla ) is most commonly used to enable relatively painless venipuncture ( blood collection ) and placement of intravenous cannulae edema of tongue , pharynx and larynx may develop as a side effect of local anaesthesia blanching of the tissues in the area where the local anaesthetic is deposited is also common this gives the area a white appearance as the blood flow is prevented due to vasoconstriction of arteries in the area the side effects of inferior alveolar nerve block include feeling tense , clenching of the fists and moaning the duration of soft tissue anaesthesia is longer than pulpal anaesthesia and is often associated with difficulty eating , drinking and speaking there is risk of accidental damage to local blood vessels during injection of the local anaesthetic solution giving local anaesthesia to patients with liver disease can have significant consequences local anaesthetics and vasoconstrictors may be administered to pregnant patients however it is very important to be extra cautious when giving a pregnant patient any type of drug an estimated one in 5,000 to 30,000 nerve blocks results in some degree of permanent persistent nerve damage general systemic adverse effects are due to the pharmacological effects of the anesthetic agents used the effects of local anesthetics are , therefore , not specific for the signal conduction in peripheral nerves high plasma levels might arise , for example , when doses intended for epidural or intrasupport tissue administration are accidentally delivered as intravascular injection this is the anticipation of pain during administration that activates the parasympathetic nervous system while inhibiting the orthosympathetic nervous system what results is a dilation of arteries in muscles which can lead to a reduction in circulating blood volume inducing a temporary shortness of blood flow to the brain a profound depression of brain functions may occur at even higher concentrations which may lead to coma , respiratory arrest , and death such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose , overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia even with proper administration , it is inevitable for some diffusion of agent into the body from the site of application due to unforeseeable anatomical idiosyncrasies of the patient this may affect the nervous system or cause the agent to enter into general circulation toxicity from anesthetic combinations is additive also cases of allergy to paraben derivatives occur , which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions exposure to aniline group chemicals such as benzocaine , lidocaine , and prilocaine can produce this effect , especially benzocaine application of local anesthetics during oocyte removal during in vitro fertilisation has been up to debate pharmacological concentrations of anesthetic agents have been found in follicular fluid despite this , risks of toxicity may be higher in pregnancy due to an increase in unbound fraction of local anesthetic and physiological changes increase the transfer of local anesthetic into the central nervous system though most reports to date have used intralipid , a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion , other emulsions , such as liposyn and medialipid , have also been shown effective though many other drugs also have membrane-stabilizing properties , not all are used as las ( propranolol , for example , though it has la properties ) local anesthetic drugs bind more readily to sodium channels in an activated state , thus onset of neuronal blockade is faster in rapidly firing neurons spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia merge into the central nervous system infiltration anesthesia is infiltration of la into the tissue to be anesthetized ; surface and infiltration anesthesia are collectively topical anesthesia field block is subcutaneous injection of an la in an area bordering on the field to be anesthetized as vazirani-akinosi is a local anaesthetic technique which requires penetration of a significant thickness of soft tissues , a long needle is used since then , several synthetic local anesthetic drugs have been developed and put into clinical use , notably lidocaine in 1943 , bupivacaine in 1957 , and prilocaine in 1959 amylocaine anesthetic general anesthetic list of cocaine

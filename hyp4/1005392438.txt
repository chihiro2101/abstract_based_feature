'' singer-songwriter '' is used to define popular music artists who write and perform their own material , which is often self-accompanied generally on acoustic guitar or piano according to allmusic , singer-songwriters ' lyrics are often personal but veiled by elaborate metaphors and vague imagery , and their creative concern is to place emphasis on the song rather than their performance of it the term has also been used to describe songwriters in the rock , folk , country , and pop music genres including henry russell , aristide bruant , hank williams , and buddy holly according to writer larry david smith , because it merged the roles of composer , writer , and singer , the popularity of the singer-songwriter reintroduced the medieval troubadour tradition of '' songs with public personalities '' after the tin pan alley era in american popular music song topics of singer-songwriters from the american folk music revival include political protest , as in the case of woody guthrie and pete seeger according to the journal of popular music studies , from the folk revival and onward into its permeance in pop music , the role of a singer-songwriter has involved several dimensions of creative identity : it can be distinguished from the rest of french '' pop '' music or soft rock format that began to spread in france during the 1960s until today , under the cultural influence of anglo-american rock music and the rock band era their songs are still popular today , often telling stories of marginalized ( de andré , guccini , dalla ) and rebellious people ( finardi , de gregori , venditti ) , or having a political background ( venditti , guccini ) battiato started as a progressive rock and cultivated music artist in the 1970s , shifting to an original blend of pop , electronic , new wave , and world music in the 1980s similarly paolo conte was often tagged as a cantautore , but was more into the jazz tradition beginning in the 1960s and following the italian cantautori style of the 1950s ( like the one of domenico modugno ) , many latin american countries developed singer-songwriter traditions that adopted elements from various popular styles at around the same time , the brazilian popular style bossa nova was evolving into a politically charged singer-songwriter tradition called tropicalismo after world war ii it was developed in italy a very prolific singer-songwriter ( in italian cantautore ) tradition , initially connected with the french school of the chansonniers , and lately developed very heterogeneously in the latter part of the 1960s and into the 1970s , socially and politically aware singer-songwriters like silvio rodríguez and pablo milanés emerged in cuba , birthing a genre known as nueva trova with the influence of tropicalismo , traditional samba and bossa nova , mpb ( música popular brasileira ) , or brazilian popular music , became highly singer-songwriter based in recent years , however , a new stock of socially conscious brazilian singer-songwriters is beginning to break the almost strictly dance-music momentum that has reigned since the 1980s ( see the 'brazilian folk/folk-rock sub-article in brazilian music ) many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a russian guitar , rarely if ever would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers what separates bard poetry from other songs is the fact that the music is far less important than the lyrics ; chord progressions are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another , made in sweden : studies in popular music , ( 2016 ) , new york : routledge , pp

the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way also , an interferometry mode will be available , with a maximum baseline of for aperture synthesis imaging observations and a baseline of for nulling interferometry this feature is along one axis with the lbti instrument at wavelengths of 2.9–13 micrometres , which is the near infrared the telescope was designed by a group of italian firms , and assembled by ansaldo in its milanese plant environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits & nbsp ; – eight of which ended up before a federal appeals court & nbsp ; – but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the united states congress the first binocular light images show three false-color renditions of the spiral galaxy ngc 2770 the second image combined two deep red colors to highlight the smoother distribution of older , cooler stars in binocular aperture synthesis mode lbt has a light-collecting area of 111 m 2 , equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter , and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope adaptive optics at a telescope 's secondary ( m2 ) was previously tested at mmt observatory by the arcetri observatory and university of arizona team some current or planned lbt telescope instruments : lbc – optical and near ultraviolet wide field prime focus cameras

the lbt was originally named the '' columbus project '' the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' the collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors , which works out to about 111 & nbsp ; m 2 combined this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way also , an interferometry mode will be available , with a maximum baseline of for aperture synthesis imaging observations and a baseline of for nulling interferometry environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits & nbsp ; – eight of which ended up before a federal appeals court & nbsp ; – but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the united states congress the telescope and mountain observatory survived two major forest fires in thirteen years , the more recent in the summer of 2017 the telescope was dedicated in october 2004 and saw first light with a single primary mirror on october 12 , 2005 which viewed ngc 891 adaptive optics at a telescope 's secondary ( m2 ) was previously tested at mmt observatory by the arcetri observatory and university of arizona team some current or planned lbt telescope instruments : lbc – optical and near ultraviolet wide field prime focus cameras ( mods1 operational – mods2 in integration on the mountain ) luci – two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers , one for each side ( associated with one of the 8m mirrors ) of the telescope

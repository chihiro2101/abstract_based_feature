the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' lbt takes advantage of active and adaptive optics , provided by arcetri observatory the collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors , which works out to about 111 & nbsp ; m 2 combined this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits & nbsp ; – eight of which ended up before a federal appeals court & nbsp ; – but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the united states congress the telescope was dedicated in october 2004 and saw first light with a single primary mirror on october 12 , 2005 which viewed ngc 891 in binocular aperture synthesis mode lbt has a light-collecting area of 111 m 2 , equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter , and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope adaptive optics at a telescope 's secondary ( m2 ) was previously tested at mmt observatory by the arcetri observatory and university of arizona team ( both cameras operational ) pepsi – a high resolution and very high-resolution optical spectrograph and imaging polarimeter at the combined focus luci ( originally lucifer : large binocular telescope near-infrared spectroscopic utility with camera and integral field unit for extragalactic research ) is the near-infrared instrument for the lbt mount graham submillimeter telescope vatican advanced technology telescope

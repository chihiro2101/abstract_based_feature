the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' lbt takes advantage of active and adaptive optics , provided by arcetri observatory the collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors , which works out to about 111 & nbsp ; m 2 combined this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way the telescope was designed by a group of italian firms , and assembled by ansaldo in its milanese plant the telescope was dedicated in october 2004 and saw first light with a single primary mirror on october 12 , 2005 which viewed ngc 891 the first binocular light images show three false-color renditions of the spiral galaxy ngc 2770 adaptive optics at a telescope 's secondary ( m2 ) was previously tested at mmt observatory by the arcetri observatory and university of arizona team some current or planned lbt telescope instruments : lbc – optical and near ultraviolet wide field prime focus cameras luci operates in the 0.9–2.5 & nbsp ; µm spectral range using a 2048 x 2048 element hawaii-2rg detector array from teledyne and provides imaging and spectroscopic capabilities in seeing- and diffraction-limited modes mount graham submillimeter telescope vatican advanced technology telescope

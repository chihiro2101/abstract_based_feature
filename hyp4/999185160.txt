the telescope design has two 8.4 & nbsp ; m ( 330 & nbsp ; inch ) mirrors mounted on a common base , hence the name '' binocular '' the collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors , which works out to about 111 & nbsp ; m 2 combined environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits & nbsp ; – eight of which ended up before a federal appeals court & nbsp ; – but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the united states congress the telescope and mountain observatory survived two major forest fires in thirteen years , the more recent in the summer of 2017 the first binocular light images show three false-color renditions of the spiral galaxy ngc 2770 in binocular aperture synthesis mode lbt has a light-collecting area of 111 m 2 , equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter , and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope it can take images with one side at 8.4 m aperture , or take two images of the same object using different instruments on each side of the telescope in the summer of 2010 , the '' first light adaptive optics '' ( flao ) – an adaptive optics system with a deformable secondary mirror rather than correcting atmospheric distortion further downstream in the optics – was inaugurated ( both cameras operational ) pepsi – a high resolution and very high-resolution optical spectrograph and imaging polarimeter at the combined focus ( mods1 operational – mods2 in integration on the mountain ) luci – two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers , one for each side ( associated with one of the 8m mirrors ) of the telescope mount graham submillimeter telescope vatican advanced technology telescope

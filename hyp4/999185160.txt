lbt takes advantage of active and adaptive optics , provided by arcetri observatory the collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors , which works out to about 111 & nbsp ; m 2 combined this area is equivalent to an circular aperture , which would be greater than any other single telescope , but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way the first binocular light images show three false-color renditions of the spiral galaxy ngc 2770 the first image taken combined ultraviolet and green light , and emphasizes the clumpy regions of newly formed hot stars in the spiral arms the third image was a composite of ultraviolet , green and deep red light and shows the detailed structure of hot , moderate and cool stars in the galaxy the cameras and images were produced by the large binocular camera team , led by emanuele giallongo at the rome astrophysical observatory in binocular aperture synthesis mode lbt has a light-collecting area of 111 m 2 , equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter , and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope it can take images with one side at 8.4 m aperture , or take two images of the same object using different instruments on each side of the telescope in the summer of 2010 , the '' first light adaptive optics '' ( flao ) – an adaptive optics system with a deformable secondary mirror rather than correcting atmospheric distortion further downstream in the optics – was inaugurated adaptive optics at a telescope 's secondary ( m2 ) was previously tested at mmt observatory by the arcetri observatory and university of arizona team

a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) the greek historian polybius likened the land between the rhône and isère rivers to the nile delta , referring to both as islands , but did not apply the word delta according to the roman geographer strabo , the cynic philosopher onesicritus of astypalaea , who accompanied alexander the great 's conquests in india , reported that patalene ( the delta of the indus river ) was '' a delta '' . the roman author arrian 's indica states that '' the delta of the land of the indians is made by the indus river no less than is the case with that of egypt '' as a generic term for the landform at the mouth of river , the word delta is first attested in the english-speaking world in the late 18th century , in the work of edward gibbon river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments when the flow enters the standing water , it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width this flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity , which diminishes the ability of the flow to sediment transport as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the deltaic lobe advances , the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation ( see slope ) if the river breaches its natural levees ( such as during a flood ) , it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean , thereby obtaining a steeper , more stable gradient the more often the flow changes course , the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan , because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas topography along active margins tend to be steeper and less widespread , which results in sediments not having the ability to pile up and accumulate due to the sediment traveling into a steep subduction trench rather than a shallow continental shelf there are many other lesser factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins when sediment does not travel far from the source , sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated , therefore making delta formation more difficult tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion , delta lobe switching , and auto cyclicity however , the sediment is never piled up in thick sequences due to the sediment traveling and depositing in deep subduction trenches the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water , the delta is characterized by homopycnal flow , in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan outflow dominated by intertia tend to form gilbert type deltas the modern mississippi river delta is a good example of a fluvial-dominated delta whose outflow is buoyancy-dominated other fluvial-dominated deltas include the mackenzie delta and the alta delta for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta in wave dominated deltas , wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta , and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line with a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore , waves will make river deltas smoother waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta , causing the delta to retreat foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta , ( and also occur on the lee side of sand dunes ) clair river bilu island volga delta yangtze delta yellow river ( also known as huanghe ) yukon–kuskokwim delta zambezi delta

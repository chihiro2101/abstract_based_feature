a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) the triangular shape of the nile delta was known to audiences of classical athenian drama ; the tragedy prometheus bound by aeschylus refers to it as the '' triangular nilotic land '' , though not as a '' delta '' according to the roman geographer strabo , the cynic philosopher onesicritus of astypalaea , who accompanied alexander the great 's conquests in india , reported that patalene ( the delta of the indus river ) was '' a delta '' as a generic term for the landform at the mouth of river , the word delta is first attested in the english-speaking world in the late 18th century , in the work of edward gibbon river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments the tidal currents also can not be too strong , as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it this flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity , which diminishes the ability of the flow to sediment transport as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the deltaic lobe advances , the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation ( see slope ) as the gradient of the river channel decreases , the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases , which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain a good example of the result of this process is the wax lake delta the more often the flow changes course , the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan , because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas there are many other lesser factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins along active margins , orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes , brecciated rocks , and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source when sediment does not travel far from the source , sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated , therefore making delta formation more difficult tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion , delta lobe switching , and auto cyclicity however , the sediment is never piled up in thick sequences due to the sediment traveling and depositing in deep subduction trenches the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan fluvial-dominated deltas are further distinguished by the relative importance of the inertia of rapidly flowing water , the importance of turbulent bed friction beyond the river mouth , and buoyancy the modern mississippi river delta is a good example of a fluvial-dominated delta whose outflow is buoyancy-dominated for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta a tidal freshwater delta is a sedimentary deposit formed at the boundary between an upland stream and an estuary , in the region known as the '' subestuary '' the origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting as the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta , the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced , causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta 's top the selenga river delta in the russian republic of buryatia is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water , in its case lake baikal while nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans , the nile delta and colorado river delta are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water some of the world 's largest regional economies are located on deltas such as the pearl river delta , yangtze river delta , low countries and the greater tokyo area e12s15 file : delta in ismenius lacus.jpg delta in ismenius lacus quadrangle , as seen by themis

a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) the greek historian polybius likened the land between the rhône and isère rivers to the nile delta , referring to both as islands , but did not apply the word delta according to the roman geographer strabo , the cynic philosopher onesicritus of astypalaea , who accompanied alexander the great 's conquests in india , reported that patalene ( the delta of the indus river ) was '' a delta '' . the roman author arrian 's indica states that '' the delta of the land of the indians is made by the indus river no less than is the case with that of egypt '' as a generic term for the landform at the mouth of river , the word delta is first attested in the english-speaking world in the late 18th century , in the work of edward gibbon river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments the tidal currents also can not be too strong , as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the deltaic lobe advances , the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation ( see slope ) typically , when the river switches channels in this manner , some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel repeated channel-switching events build up a mature delta with a distributary network when this mid-channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river , the flow is routed around it this results in the smoothing of the planform ( or map-view ) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment the more often the flow changes course , the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan , because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front the mississippi and ural river deltas , with their bird's-feet , are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water , the delta is characterized by homopycnal flow , in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load where the river water has higher density than basin water , typically from a heavy load of sediment , the delta is characterized by hypercynal flow in which the river water hugs the basin bottom as a density current that deposits its sediments as turbidites when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan channel abandonment has been frequent , with seven distinct channels active over the last 5000 years for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta for deltas that form further upriver in an estuary , there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds , tides , river discharge , and delta water levels erosion is also an important control in tide-dominated deltas , such as the ganges delta , which may be mainly submarine , with prominent sandbars and ridges the origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting other rivers , particularly those on coasts with significant tidal range , do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an estuary the selenga river delta in the russian republic of buryatia is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water , in its case lake baikal clair river bilu island volga delta yangtze delta yellow river ( also known as huanghe ) yukon–kuskokwim delta zambezi delta while nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans , the nile delta and colorado river delta are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water making deltas a common location for civilizations to flourish due to access to flat land for farming , freshwater for sanitation and irrigation , and sea access for trade

a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) the triangular shape of the nile delta was known to audiences of classical athenian drama ; the tragedy prometheus bound by aeschylus refers to it as the '' triangular nilotic land '' , though not as a '' delta '' herodotus 's description of egypt in his histories mentions the delta fourteen times , as '' the delta , as it is called by the ionians '' , including describing the outflow of silt into the sea and the convexly curved seaward side of the triangle the greek historian polybius likened the land between the rhône and isère rivers to the nile delta , referring to both as islands , but did not apply the word delta according to the roman geographer strabo , the cynic philosopher onesicritus of astypalaea , who accompanied alexander the great 's conquests in india , reported that patalene ( the delta of the indus river ) was '' a delta '' . the roman author arrian 's indica states that '' the delta of the land of the indians is made by the indus river no less than is the case with that of egypt '' as a generic term for the landform at the mouth of river , the word delta is first attested in the english-speaking world in the late 18th century , in the work of edward gibbon river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the deltaic lobe advances , the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation ( see slope ) another way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of mouth bars ( mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river ) there are many other lesser factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins along active margins , orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes , brecciated rocks , and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source when sediment does not travel far from the source , sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated , therefore making delta formation more difficult tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion , delta lobe switching , and auto cyclicity active margin river deltas tend to be much smaller and less abundant but may transport similar amounts of sediment the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river fluvial-dominated deltas are found in areas of low tidal range and low wave energy where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water , the delta is characterized by homopycnal flow , in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan fluvial-dominated deltas are further distinguished by the relative importance of the inertia of rapidly flowing water , the importance of turbulent bed friction beyond the river mouth , and buoyancy outflow dominated by intertia tend to form gilbert type deltas other fluvial-dominated deltas include the mackenzie delta and the alta delta for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta in wave dominated deltas , wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta , and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta , causing the delta to retreat for deltas that form further upriver in an estuary , there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds , tides , river discharge , and delta water levels d.g.a whitten , the penguin dictionary of geology ( 1972 ) the bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front , as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy clair river bilu island volga delta yangtze delta yellow river ( also known as huanghe ) yukon–kuskokwim delta zambezi delta some of the world 's largest regional economies are located on deltas such as the pearl river delta , yangtze river delta , low countries and the greater tokyo area

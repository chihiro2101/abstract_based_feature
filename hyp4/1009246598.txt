a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) herodotus 's description of egypt in his histories mentions the delta fourteen times , as '' the delta , as it is called by the ionians '' , including describing the outflow of silt into the sea and the convexly curved seaward side of the triangle as a generic term for the landform at the mouth of river , the word delta is first attested in the english-speaking world in the late 18th century , in the work of edward gibbon river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments the tidal currents also can not be too strong , as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it this flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity , which diminishes the ability of the flow to sediment transport as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the gradient of the river channel decreases , the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases , which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain this destabilizes the river channel another way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of mouth bars ( mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river ) this results in the smoothing of the planform ( or map-view ) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment because the sediment is laid down in this fashion , the shape of these deltas approximates a fan the more often the flow changes course , the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan , because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front the mississippi and ural river deltas , with their bird's-feet , are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas along active margins , orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes , brecciated rocks , and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source when sediment does not travel far from the source , sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated , therefore making delta formation more difficult , deltas , models for exploration : houston geological society , houston , texas , pp the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water , the delta is characterized by homopycnal flow , in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan beds in a hypocynal delta dip at a very shallow angle , around 1 degree the modern mississippi river delta is a good example of a fluvial-dominated delta whose outflow is buoyancy-dominated for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta in wave dominated deltas , wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta , and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line the relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin 105 ( 48 ) : 18692â€“18695 , tidal deltas behave differently from a river- and wave-dominated deltas , which tend to have a few main distributaries while nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans , the nile delta and colorado river delta are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water as humans have altered surface roughness , runoff , and groundwater storage , studies have shown river delta retreat some of the world 's largest regional economies are located on deltas such as the pearl river delta , yangtze river delta , low countries and the greater tokyo area

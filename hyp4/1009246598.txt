a river delta is so named because the shape of the nile delta approximates the triangular uppercase delta ( letter ) the triangular shape of the nile delta was known to audiences of classical athenian drama ; the tragedy prometheus bound by aeschylus refers to it as the '' triangular nilotic land '' , though not as a '' delta '' the greek historian polybius likened the land between the rhône and isère rivers to the nile delta , referring to both as islands , but did not apply the word delta according to the roman geographer strabo , the cynic philosopher onesicritus of astypalaea , who accompanied alexander the great 's conquests in india , reported that patalene ( the delta of the indus river ) was '' a delta '' . the roman author arrian 's indica states that '' the delta of the land of the indians is made by the indus river no less than is the case with that of egypt '' river deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either ( 1 ) a body of water , such as a lake , ocean , or reservoir , ( 2 ) another river that can not remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation , or ( 3 ) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments the tidal currents also can not be too strong , as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it as a result , sediment drops out of the flow and is deposited as alluvium , which builds up to form the river delta over time , this single channel builds a deltaic lobe ( such as the bird's-foot of the mississippi or ural river deltas ) , pushing its mouth into the standing water as the deltaic lobe advances , the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation ( see slope ) if the river breaches its natural levees ( such as during a flood ) , it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean , thereby obtaining a steeper , more stable gradient another way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of mouth bars ( mid-channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river ) this results in the smoothing of the planform ( or map-view ) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment the more often the flow changes course , the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan , because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front most large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the mississippi , nile , amazon , ganges , indus , yangtze , and yellow river discharging along passive continental margins topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas topography along active margins tend to be steeper and less widespread , which results in sediments not having the ability to pile up and accumulate due to the sediment traveling into a steep subduction trench rather than a shallow continental shelf there are many other lesser factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins when sediment does not travel far from the source , sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated , therefore making delta formation more difficult the other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river fluvial-dominated deltas are found in areas of low tidal range and low wave energy where the river water is nearly equal in density to the basin water , the delta is characterized by homopycnal flow , in which the river water rapidly mixes with basin water and abruptly dumps most of its sediment load where the river water has higher density than basin water , typically from a heavy load of sediment , the delta is characterized by hypercynal flow in which the river water hugs the basin bottom as a density current that deposits its sediments as turbidites when the river water is less dense than the basin water , as is typical of river deltas on an ocean coastline , the delta is characterized by hypopycnal flow in which the river water is slow to mix with the denser basin water and spreads out as a surface fan a gilbert delta ( named after grove karl gilbert ) is a type of fluvial-dominated delta formed from coarse sediments , as opposed to gently-sloping muddy deltas such as that of the mississippi for example , a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta , causing the delta to retreat clair river bilu island volga delta yangtze delta yellow river ( also known as huanghe ) yukon–kuskokwim delta zambezi delta while nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans , the nile delta and colorado river delta are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water some of the world 's largest regional economies are located on deltas such as the pearl river delta , yangtze river delta , low countries and the greater tokyo area file

beginning with luna 2 in 1959 , the first few spacecraft to reach the lunar surface were impactors , not landers in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth the soviet venera program included a number of venus landers , some of which were crushed during descent much as galileo 's jupiter '' lander '' and others which successfully touched down venera 3 in 1966 and venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on venus respectively three other landers , mars 2 in 1971 and mars 5 and mars 6 in 1973 , either crashed or failed to even enter the planet 's atmosphere mars 2 and mars 3 landers carried the first small skis-walking mars rovers that did not work on the planet a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems this would have consisted of two orbiters and two landers , launched by a single saturn v rocket , but the mission was cancelled a planned repeat of this mission , mars 98 , was cancelled due to lack of funding mars pathfinder was launched in december 1996 and released the first acting rover on mars , named sojourner , in july 1997 mars pathfinder was part of the canceled mars environmental survey program with a set of 16 landers planned for 1999â€“2009 the american mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity were launched in june and july 2003 spacecraft phoenix successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of mars on 25 may 2008 , using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines planned for 2018 , nasa 's mars astrobiology explorer-cacher lander mission was canceled due to budget cuts amongst them , russia has planned a mars sample return mission mars-grunt for around 2026 , and china for around 2030 while several flybys conducted by mars orbiting probes have provided images and other data about the martian moons phobos and deimos , only few of them intended to land on the surface of these satellites the post-soviet russian fobos-grunt probe was an intended sample return mission to phobos in 2012 but failed after launch in 2011 the landing on titan in 2005 was the first landing on the planet 's satellites outside the moon nasa 's canceled comet rendezvous asteroid flyby mission considered the launch in 1995 and landing of penetrators on a comet 's nucleus in 2001 due to the extremely low gravity of such bodies , the landing system included a harpoon launcher intended to anchor a cable in the comet 's surface and pull the lander down however , the mission failed with the loss of its mother ship , mars polar lander , which lost communication with earth during entry into mars ' atmosphere on 3 december 1999 the dart spacecraft will impact asteroid 65803 didymos 's moon dimorphos in 2022 , and the hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact

beginning with luna 2 in 1959 , the first few spacecraft to reach the lunar surface were impactors , not landers in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth as a result , these robotic missions required soft landers to sample the lunar soil and determine the thickness of the dust layer , which was unknown before surveyor the altair spacecraft , previously known as the '' lunar surface access module '' or '' lsam '' , was the planned lander for the constellation program prior to the cancellation of project constellation russia has plans for the luna-grunt mission to return samples from the moon by 2021 lander vikram on chandrayaan-2 , a maiden soft landing effort by the indian space research organization , lost contact to control on 6 september 2019 , some minutes before landing the soviet venera program included a number of venus landers , some of which were crushed during descent much as galileo 's jupiter '' lander '' and others which successfully touched down venera 3 in 1966 and venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on venus respectively the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 the soviet union planned the heavy marsokhod mars 4nm mission in 1973 and the mars sample return mars 5nm mission in 1975 , but neither occurred due to needing the n1 ( rocket ) that was never flown successfully a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems mars 96 was the first complex post-soviet russian mission with an orbiter , lander , and penetrators spacecraft phoenix successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of mars on 25 may 2008 , using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines planned for 2018 , nasa 's mars astrobiology explorer-cacher lander mission was canceled due to budget cuts while several flybys conducted by mars orbiting probes have provided images and other data about the martian moons phobos and deimos , only few of them intended to land on the surface of these satellites since 2007 the canadian space agency has considered a mission to phobos called phobos reconnaissance and international mars exploration ( prime ) , which would include an orbiter and lander recent proposals include a 2008 nasa glenn research center phobos and deimos sample return mission , the 2013 phobos surveyor , and the osiris-rex ii mission concept the huygens probe , carried to saturn 's moon titan by cassini , was specifically designed to survive landing on land or on liquid nasa 's canceled comet rendezvous asteroid flyby mission considered the launch in 1995 and landing of penetrators on a comet 's nucleus in 2001 comet tempel 1 was visited by nasa 's deep impact probe on 4 july 2005 the esa 's aida mission concept would investigate the effects of impact crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid the dart spacecraft will impact asteroid 65803 didymos 's moon dimorphos in 2022 , and the hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact

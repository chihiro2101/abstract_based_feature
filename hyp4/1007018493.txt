beginning with luna 2 in 1959 , the first few spacecraft to reach the lunar surface were impactors , not landers in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth the altair spacecraft , previously known as the '' lunar surface access module '' or '' lsam '' , was the planned lander for the constellation program prior to the cancellation of project constellation these vehicles include the mighty eagle lander and the morpheus lander chang ' e 5 and chang ' e 6 are designed to be sample return missions lander vikram on chandrayaan-2 , a maiden soft landing effort by the indian space research organization , lost contact to control on 6 september 2019 , some minutes before landing venera 3 in 1966 and venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on venus respectively the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 three other landers , mars 2 in 1971 and mars 5 and mars 6 in 1973 , either crashed or failed to even enter the planet 's atmosphere mars 2 and mars 3 landers carried the first small skis-walking mars rovers that did not work on the planet a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems viking 1 and viking 2 were launched respectively in august and september 1975 , each comprising an orbiter vehicle and a lander mars 96 was the first complex post-soviet russian mission with an orbiter , lander , and penetrators mars pathfinder was launched in december 1996 and released the first acting rover on mars , named sojourner , in july 1997 mars pathfinder was part of the canceled mars environmental survey program with a set of 16 landers planned for 1999â€“2009 as of 13 february 2017 , opportunity was declared effectively dead , having exceeded its three-month design lifetime by well over a decade spacecraft phoenix successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of mars on 25 may 2008 , using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines planned for 2018 , nasa 's mars astrobiology explorer-cacher lander mission was canceled due to budget cuts amongst them , russia has planned a mars sample return mission mars-grunt for around 2026 , and china for around 2030 the huygens probe , carried to saturn 's moon titan by cassini , was specifically designed to survive landing on land or on liquid the deep space 2 impactor probe was to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet the dart spacecraft will impact asteroid 65803 didymos 's moon dimorphos in 2022 , and the hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact

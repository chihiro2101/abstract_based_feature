in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth these vehicles include the mighty eagle lander and the morpheus lander in 2019 , china 's chang ' e 4 mission successfully landed the yutu-2 rover on the far side of the moon lander vikram on chandrayaan-2 , a maiden soft landing effort by the indian space research organization , lost contact to control on 6 september 2019 , some minutes before landing venera 3 in 1966 and venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on venus respectively the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 in 1971 , the lander of the mars 3 probe conducted the first soft landing on mars , but communication was lost within a minute after touchdown , which occurred during one of the worst global dust storms since the beginning of telescopic observations of the red planet three other landers , mars 2 in 1971 and mars 5 and mars 6 in 1973 , either crashed or failed to even enter the planet 's atmosphere a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems mars 96 was the first complex post-soviet russian mission with an orbiter , lander , and penetrators a planned repeat of this mission , mars 98 , was cancelled due to lack of funding mars pathfinder was launched in december 1996 and released the first acting rover on mars , named sojourner , in july 1997 the mars polar lander ceased communication on 3 december 1999 prior to reaching the surface and is presumed to have crashed the european beagle 2 lander deployed successfully from the mars express spacecraft but the signal confirming a landing which should have come on 25 december 2003 was not received spacecraft phoenix successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of mars on 25 may 2008 , using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines mars science laboratory , which carried the rover curiosity , was successfully launched by nasa on 26 november 2011 planned for 2018 , nasa 's mars astrobiology explorer-cacher lander mission was canceled due to budget cuts in 2007 european space agency and eads astrium proposed and developed the mission to phobos to 2016 with lander and sample return , but it stayed as a project the landing on titan in 2005 was the first landing on the planet 's satellites outside the moon due to the extremely low gravity of such bodies , the landing system included a harpoon launcher intended to anchor a cable in the comet 's surface and pull the lander down however , the mission failed with the loss of its mother ship , mars polar lander , which lost communication with earth during entry into mars ' atmosphere on 3 december 1999 the dart spacecraft will impact asteroid 65803 didymos 's moon dimorphos in 2022 , and the hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact

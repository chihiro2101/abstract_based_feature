in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth as a result , these robotic missions required soft landers to sample the lunar soil and determine the thickness of the dust layer , which was unknown before surveyor the altair spacecraft , previously known as the '' lunar surface access module '' or '' lsam '' , was the planned lander for the constellation program prior to the cancellation of project constellation russia has plans for the luna-grunt mission to return samples from the moon by 2021 the soviet venera program included a number of venus landers , some of which were crushed during descent much as galileo 's jupiter '' lander '' and others which successfully touched down the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 three other landers , mars 2 in 1971 and mars 5 and mars 6 in 1973 , either crashed or failed to even enter the planet 's atmosphere mars 2 and mars 3 landers carried the first small skis-walking mars rovers that did not work on the planet the soviet union planned the heavy marsokhod mars 4nm mission in 1973 and the mars sample return mars 5nm mission in 1975 , but neither occurred due to needing the n1 ( rocket ) that was never flown successfully a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems the viking program rovers were the first successful , functioning mars landers mars pathfinder was part of the canceled mars environmental survey program with a set of 16 landers planned for 1999â€“2009 the american mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity were launched in june and july 2003 spacecraft phoenix successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of mars on 25 may 2008 , using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines planned for 2018 , nasa 's mars astrobiology explorer-cacher lander mission was canceled due to budget cuts while several flybys conducted by mars orbiting probes have provided images and other data about the martian moons phobos and deimos , only few of them intended to land on the surface of these satellites two probes under the soviet phobos program were successfully launched in 1988 , but in 1989 the intended landings on phobos and deimos were not conducted due to failures in the spacecraft system in 2007 european space agency and eads astrium proposed and developed the mission to phobos to 2016 with lander and sample return , but it stayed as a project the small nuclear-powered europa lander was proposed as part of nasa 's jupiter icy moons orbiter ( jimo ) mission that was canceled in 2006 in addition , nasa offered the esa the opportunity to design a lander or impactor to fly alongside nasa 's proposed orbiter in the europa clipper mission planned for 2025 however , the mission failed with the loss of its mother ship , mars polar lander , which lost communication with earth during entry into mars ' atmosphere on 3 december 1999 the esa 's aida mission concept would investigate the effects of impact crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid

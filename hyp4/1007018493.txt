beginning with luna 2 in 1959 , the first few spacecraft to reach the lunar surface were impactors , not landers in 1966 , the soviet luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to earth the altair spacecraft , previously known as the '' lunar surface access module '' or '' lsam '' , was the planned lander for the constellation program prior to the cancellation of project constellation these vehicles include the mighty eagle lander and the morpheus lander the project morpheus lander may have sufficient thrust to propel a crewed ascent stage lander vikram on chandrayaan-2 , a maiden soft landing effort by the indian space research organization , lost contact to control on 6 september 2019 , some minutes before landing the soviet venera program included a number of venus landers , some of which were crushed during descent much as galileo 's jupiter '' lander '' and others which successfully touched down venera 3 in 1966 and venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on venus respectively the soviet union 's mars 1962b became the first earth-based mission intended to impact on mars in 1962 three other landers , mars 2 in 1971 and mars 5 and mars 6 in 1973 , either crashed or failed to even enter the planet 's atmosphere all four landers used an aeroshell-like heat shield during atmospheric entry mars 2 and mars 3 landers carried the first small skis-walking mars rovers that did not work on the planet a double-launching soviet mars 5m ( mars-79 ) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems mars 96 was the first complex post-soviet russian mission with an orbiter , lander , and penetrators a planned repeat of this mission , mars 98 , was cancelled due to lack of funding mars pathfinder was part of the canceled mars environmental survey program with a set of 16 landers planned for 1999â€“2009 the european beagle 2 lander deployed successfully from the mars express spacecraft but the signal confirming a landing which should have come on 25 december 2003 was not received they reached the martian surface in january 2004 using landers featuring airbags and parachutes to soften impact spacecraft phoenix successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of mars on 25 may 2008 , using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines the landing on titan in 2005 was the first landing on the planet 's satellites outside the moon the deep space 2 impactor probe was to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet the dart spacecraft will impact asteroid 65803 didymos 's moon dimorphos in 2022 , and the hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact

whereas modern interframe video formats , such as mpeg1 , mpeg2 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc , achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better , m-jpeg 's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower , depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output as a purely intraframe compression scheme , the image quality of m-jpeg is directly a function of each video frame 's static ( spatial ) complexity it is neither hindered by highly random motion ( such as the water-surface turbulence in a large waterfall ) , nor helped by the absence of motion ( such as static landscape shot by tripod ) , which are two opposite extremes commonly used to test interframe video formats mjpeg-b no longer retains valid jpeg interchange files within it , hence it is not possible to take a frame into a jpeg file without slightly modifying the headers since the development of the original jpeg standard in the early 1990s , technology improvements have been made not only to the jpeg format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well motion jpeg is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard ( jpeg ) with well-developed libraries , and it is an intraframe method of compression unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as mpeg-2 and the format specified in the jpeg still-picture coding standard , there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “ motion jpeg ” for use in all contexts for example , microsoft documents their standard format to store m-jpeg in avi files , apple documents how m-jpeg is stored in quicktime files , rfc 2435 describes how m-jpeg is implemented in an rtp stream , and an m-jpeg codecid is planned for the matroska file format m-jpeg is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras , ip cameras , and webcams , as well as by non-linear video editing systems this results in a very basic , but serviceable video output at a similar storage cost to mpeg ( ~120 kb/s video rate , ~8 kb/s audio – or approx 1 mbit/s at 320×240 resolution ) , but with minimal processing overheads this video is typically stored in the popular windows avi or apple quicktime mov container files , generally viewable natively ( or after installation of a simple codec ) in most versions of the applicable operating system apple announced on september 1 , 2010 that their newest version of the apple tv would support m-jpeg up to 35 mbit/s , 1280 by 720 pixels , 30 frames per second , audio in μlaw , pcm stereo audio in in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http

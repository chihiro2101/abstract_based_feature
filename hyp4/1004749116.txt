motion jpeg was originally developed for multimedia pc applications whereas modern interframe video formats , such as mpeg1 , mpeg2 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc , achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better , m-jpeg 's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower , depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output as a purely intraframe compression scheme , the image quality of m-jpeg is directly a function of each video frame 's static ( spatial ) complexity jpeg is inefficient , using more bits to deliver similar quality , compared to more modern formats ( such as jpeg 2000 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc ) since the development of the original jpeg standard in the early 1990s , technology improvements have been made not only to the jpeg format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well motion jpeg is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard ( jpeg ) with well-developed libraries , and it is an intraframe method of compression it tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream , whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as mpeg-2 and the format specified in the jpeg still-picture coding standard , there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “ motion jpeg ” for use in all contexts for example , microsoft documents their standard format to store m-jpeg in avi files , apple documents how m-jpeg is stored in quicktime files , rfc 2435 describes how m-jpeg is implemented in an rtp stream , and an m-jpeg codecid is planned for the matroska file format m-jpeg is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras , ip cameras , and webcams , as well as by non-linear video editing systems modern desktop cpus are powerful enough to work with high-definition video , so no special hardware is required , and they in turn offer native random-access to any frame in addition to portable players ( which are mainly '' consumers '' of the video ) , many video-enabled digital cameras use m-jpeg for video-capture in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http

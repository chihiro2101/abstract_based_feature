motion jpeg was originally developed for multimedia pc applications whereas modern interframe video formats , such as mpeg1 , mpeg2 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc , achieve real-world compression ratios of 1:50 or better , m-jpeg 's lack of interframe prediction limits its efficiency to 1:20 or lower , depending on the tolerance to spatial artifacting in the compressed output as a purely intraframe compression scheme , the image quality of m-jpeg is directly a function of each video frame 's static ( spatial ) complexity mjpeg-b no longer retains valid jpeg interchange files within it , hence it is not possible to take a frame into a jpeg file without slightly modifying the headers jpeg is inefficient , using more bits to deliver similar quality , compared to more modern formats ( such as jpeg 2000 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc ) since the development of the original jpeg standard in the early 1990s , technology improvements have been made not only to the jpeg format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well motion jpeg is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard ( jpeg ) with well-developed libraries , and it is an intraframe method of compression it tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream , whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame for example , microsoft documents their standard format to store m-jpeg in avi files , apple documents how m-jpeg is stored in quicktime files , rfc 2435 describes how m-jpeg is implemented in an rtp stream , and an m-jpeg codecid is planned for the matroska file format m-jpeg is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras , ip cameras , and webcams , as well as by non-linear video editing systems in addition to portable players ( which are mainly '' consumers '' of the video ) , many video-enabled digital cameras use m-jpeg for video-capture the d90 uses three different motion jpeg formats : 320×216 pixels , 640×424 pixels and 1280×720 pixels in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http

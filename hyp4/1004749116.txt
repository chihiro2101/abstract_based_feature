motion jpeg was originally developed for multimedia pc applications as a purely intraframe compression scheme , the image quality of m-jpeg is directly a function of each video frame 's static ( spatial ) complexity it is neither hindered by highly random motion ( such as the water-surface turbulence in a large waterfall ) , nor helped by the absence of motion ( such as static landscape shot by tripod ) , which are two opposite extremes commonly used to test interframe video formats jpeg is inefficient , using more bits to deliver similar quality , compared to more modern formats ( such as jpeg 2000 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc ) since the development of the original jpeg standard in the early 1990s , technology improvements have been made not only to the jpeg format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well motion jpeg is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard ( jpeg ) with well-developed libraries , and it is an intraframe method of compression it tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream , whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame unlike the video formats specified in international standards such as mpeg-2 and the format specified in the jpeg still-picture coding standard , there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “ motion jpeg ” for use in all contexts m-jpeg is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras , ip cameras , and webcams , as well as by non-linear video editing systems it is natively supported by the quicktime player , the playstation console , and web browsers such as safari , google chrome , mozilla firefox and microsoft edge in addition to portable players ( which are mainly '' consumers '' of the video ) , many video-enabled digital cameras use m-jpeg for video-capture for cameras that do n't provide this feature natively , a server can be used to transcode the camera pictures into an m-jpeg stream and then provide that stream to other network clients in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http

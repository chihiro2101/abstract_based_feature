motion jpeg was originally developed for multimedia pc applications m-jpeg is an intraframe-only compression scheme ( compared with the more computationally intensive technique of motion compensation ) as a purely intraframe compression scheme , the image quality of m-jpeg is directly a function of each video frame 's static ( spatial ) complexity m-jpeg-compressed video is also insensitive to motion complexity , i.e jpeg is inefficient , using more bits to deliver similar quality , compared to more modern formats ( such as jpeg 2000 and h.264/mpeg-4 avc ) since the development of the original jpeg standard in the early 1990s , technology improvements have been made not only to the jpeg format but to the interframe compression schemas possible as well motion jpeg is simple to implement because it uses a mature compression standard ( jpeg ) with well-developed libraries , and it is an intraframe method of compression it tolerates rapidly changing motion in the video stream , whereas compression schemes using interframe compression can often experience unacceptable quality loss when the video content changes significantly between each frame m-jpeg is now used by video-capture devices such as digital cameras , ip cameras , and webcams , as well as by non-linear video editing systems in addition to portable players ( which are mainly '' consumers '' of the video ) , many video-enabled digital cameras use m-jpeg for video-capture the d90 uses three different motion jpeg formats : 320×216 pixels , 640×424 pixels and 1280×720 pixels in response to a get request for a mjpeg file or stream , the server streams the sequence of jpeg frames over http native web browser support includes : safari , google chrome , microsoft edge and firefox

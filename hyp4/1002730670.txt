the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth other parafunctional activity which may occur together with bruxism : cheek biting ( which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum and/or linea alba ) , and/or lip biting tenderness , pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication , which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement pain or tenderness of the temporomandibular joints , which may manifest as preauricular pain ( in front of the ear ) , or pain referred to the ear ( otalgia ) the large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system , namely the teeth , the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull ( the temporomandibular joints ) many publications list tooth wear as a consequence of bruxism , but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism people with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth ( back teeth ) , which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth , in the cervical region as v-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both most ( but not all ) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups ; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only , which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles some bruxism activity is rhythmic with bite force pulses of tenths of a second ( like chewing ) , and some have longer bite force pulses of 1 to 30 seconds ( clenching )

most people who brux are unaware of the problem , either because there are no symptoms , or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth tenderness , pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication , which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement bruxism is usually detected because of the effects of the process ( most commonly tooth wear and pain ) , rather than the process itself many publications list tooth wear as a consequence of bruxism , but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism this is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism , and affects the occlusal surface ( the biting surface ) of the teeth the exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs , e.g people with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth ( back teeth ) , which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface abfraction is another type of tooth wear that is postulated to occur with bruxism , although some still argue whether this type of tooth wear is a reality it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in tmd

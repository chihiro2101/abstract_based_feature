most people who brux are unaware of the problem , either because there are no symptoms , or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline tooth fractures , and repeated failure of dental restorations ( fillings , crowns , etc inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth other parafunctional activity which may occur together with bruxism : cheek biting ( which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum and/or linea alba ) , and/or lip biting tenderness , pain or fatigue of the muscles of mastication , which may get worse during chewing or other jaw movement the large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system , namely the teeth , the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull ( the temporomandibular joints ) many publications list tooth wear as a consequence of bruxism , but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism people with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth ( back teeth ) , which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface if enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed , the tooth will effectively be weakened , and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both a systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism , there is a positive association with tmd pain , and when stricter diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used , the association with tmd symptoms is much lower

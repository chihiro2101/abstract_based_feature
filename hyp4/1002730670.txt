most people who brux are unaware of the problem , either because there are no symptoms , or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth noises are rarely associated with awake bruxism hypertrophy of the muscles of mastication ( increase in the size of the muscles that move the jaw ) , particularly the masseter muscle the large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system , namely the teeth , the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull ( the temporomandibular joints ) many publications list tooth wear as a consequence of bruxism , but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism this is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism , and affects the occlusal surface ( the biting surface ) of the teeth abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth , in the cervical region as v-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces the pain may be felt over the angle of the jaw ( masseter ) or in the temple ( temporalis ) , and may be described as a headache or an aching jaw most ( but not all ) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups ; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only , which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in tmd

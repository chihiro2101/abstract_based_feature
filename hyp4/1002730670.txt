most people who brux are unaware of the problem , either because there are no symptoms , or because the symptoms are not understood to be associated with a clenching and grinding problem the symptoms of sleep bruxism are usually most intense immediately after waking , and then slowly abate , and the symptoms of a grinding habit which occurs mainly while awake tend to worsen through the day , and may not be present on waking bruxism may cause a variety of signs and symptoms , including : excessive tooth wear , particularly attrition , which flattens the occlusal ( biting ) surface , but also possibly other types of tooth wear such as abfraction , where notches form around the neck of the teeth at the gumline inflammation of the periodontal ligament of teeth , which may make them sore to bite on , and possibly also a degree of loosening of the teeth other parafunctional activity which may occur together with bruxism : cheek biting ( which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum and/or linea alba ) , and/or lip biting bruxism is usually detected because of the effects of the process ( most commonly tooth wear and pain ) , rather than the process itself the large forces that can be generated during bruxism can have detrimental effects on the components of masticatory system , namely the teeth , the periodontium and the articulation of the mandible with the skull ( the temporomandibular joints ) this is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism , and affects the occlusal surface ( the biting surface ) of the teeth abfraction is another type of tooth wear that is postulated to occur with bruxism , although some still argue whether this type of tooth wear is a reality it is also generally accepted that periodontal disease is a far more common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism , although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both the pain in the muscles of mastication caused by bruxism can be likened to muscle pain after exercise most ( but not all ) bruxism includes clenching force provided by masseter and temporalis muscle groups ; but some bruxers clench and grind front teeth only , which involves minimal action of the masseter and temporalis muscles in individuals without bruxism or other parafunctional activities , during wakefulness the jaw is generally at rest and the teeth are not in contact , except while speaking , swallowing or chewing

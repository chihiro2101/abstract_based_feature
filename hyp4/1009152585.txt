the use of anticoagulants is a decision based upon the risks and benefits of anticoagulation the biggest risk of anticoagulation therapy is the increased risk of bleeding in otherwise healthy people , the increased risk of bleeding is minimal , but those who have had recent surgery , cerebral aneurysms , and other conditions may have too great of risk of bleeding the decision to begin therapeutic anticoagulation often involves the use of multiple bleeding risk predictable outcome tools as non-invasive pre-test stratifications due to the potential for bleeds while on blood thinning agents the risk of bleeding using the aforementioned risk assessment tools must then be weighed against thrombotic risk in order to formally determine patient 's overall benefit in starting anticoagulation therapy the most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding , both nonmajor and major bleeding events risk of bleeding is dependent on the class of anticoagulant agent used , patient 's age , and pre-existing health conditions newer non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants appear to have fewer life-threatening bleeding events compared to warfarin additionally , patients aged 80 years or more may be especially susceptible to bleeding complications , with a rate of 13 bleeds per 100 person-years bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and noac therapy due to the fact that all noacs , to some extent , are excreted by the kidneys thus , patients with renal impairment may be at higher risk of increased bleeding in people with cancer , a systematic review has found warfarin had no effect on death rate or the risk of blood clots however it did increase the risk of major bleeding in 107 more people per 1000 population and minor bleeding in 167 more people in 1000 population apixaban had no effect on mortality , recurrence of blood clots in blood vessels or major bleeding or minor bleeding , however this finding comes only from one study skin necrosis and limb gangrene are most commonly observed on the third to eighth day of therapy purple toe syndrome typically develops three to eight weeks after initiation of warfarin therapy grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs , increasing the amount of time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body , and so should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs anticoagulants are often used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis people using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way since the 2000s a number of agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as directly acting oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) , novel oral anticoagulants ( noacs ) , or non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants the newer anticoagulants ( noacs/doacs ) , are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used with care in patients with kidney problems there are three major categories of heparin : unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) , low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) , and ultra-low-molecular weight heparin ( ulmwh ) heparin can be used in vivo ( by injection ) , and also in vitro to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices lmwh exhibits higher anti-xa/anti-iia activity ratio and is useful as it does not require monitoring of the aptt coagulation parameter and has fewer side effects the directly acting oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) were introduced on and after 2008 as in any invasive procedures , patients on anticoagulation therapy have increased risk for bleeding and caution should be used along with local hemostasis methods to minimize bleeding risk during the operation as well as post-operatively citrate is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests , as well as in blood transfusion bags detecting overdose an overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term , in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure the inr test measures the time taken for a clot to form in a blood sample , relative to a standard on the basis of limited evidence , general consensus appears to be that in most patients who are receiving the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants ( i.e

the use of anticoagulants is a decision based upon the risks and benefits of anticoagulation the biggest risk of anticoagulation therapy is the increased risk of bleeding in otherwise healthy people , the increased risk of bleeding is minimal , but those who have had recent surgery , cerebral aneurysms , and other conditions may have too great of risk of bleeding the decision to begin therapeutic anticoagulation often involves the use of multiple bleeding risk predictable outcome tools as non-invasive pre-test stratifications due to the potential for bleeds while on blood thinning agents the most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding , both nonmajor and major bleeding events risk of bleeding is dependent on the class of anticoagulant agent used , patient 's age , and pre-existing health conditions warfarin has an estimated incidence of bleeding of 15-20 % per year and life-threatening bleeding rate of 1-3 % per year bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and noac therapy due to the fact that all noacs , to some extent , are excreted by the kidneys thus , patients with renal impairment may be at higher risk of increased bleeding however it did increase the risk of major bleeding in 107 more people per 1000 population and minor bleeding in 167 more people in 1000 population apixaban had no effect on mortality , recurrence of blood clots in blood vessels or major bleeding or minor bleeding , however this finding comes only from one study nonhemorrhagic adverse events are less common than hemorrhagic adverse events but should still be monitored closely the exact pathogenesis of skin necrosis and limb gangrene are not completely understood but are believed to be associated with warfarin 's effect on inhibiting production of protein c and protein s another potentially serious complication associated with heparin use is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) immune-mediated hit most commonly arises five to ten days after exposure to heparin grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs , increasing the amount of time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body , and so should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs people using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way a prominent member of this class is warfarin ( coumadin ) and was found to be the dominant anticoagulant prescribed in a large multispecialty practice it takes at least 48 to 72 hours for the anticoagulant effect to develop there are three major categories of heparin : unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) , low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) , and ultra-low-molecular weight heparin ( ulmwh ) heparin can be used in vivo ( by injection ) , and also in vitro to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices there are five doacs currently on the market : dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , edoxaban and betrixaban routine monitoring and dose adjustments of doacs is less important than for warfarin , as they have better predictable anticoagulation activity doacs are a lot more expensive than warfarin , after having taken into consideration the cost of frequent blood testing associated with warfarin the development of letaxaban was discontinued for acute coronary syndrome in may 2011 following negative results from a phase ii study as in any invasive procedures , patients on anticoagulation therapy have increased risk for bleeding and caution should be used along with local hemostasis methods to minimize bleeding risk during the operation as well as post-operatively many other anticoagulants exist , for use in research and development , diagnostics , or as drug candidates dental treatment of patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication raises safety concerns in terms of the potential risk of bleeding complications following invasive dental procedures in patients deemed to be at higher risk of bleeding ( e.g the most promising ones act on the contact activation system ( factor xiia and factor xia ) ; it is anticipated that this may provide agents that prevent thrombosis without conferring a risk of bleeding .

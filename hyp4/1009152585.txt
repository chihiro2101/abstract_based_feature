the use of anticoagulants is a decision based upon the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in otherwise healthy people , the increased risk of bleeding is minimal , but those who have had recent surgery , cerebral aneurysms , and other conditions may have too great of risk of bleeding the most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding , both nonmajor and major bleeding events risk of bleeding is dependent on the class of anticoagulant agent used , patient 's age , and pre-existing health conditions newer non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants appear to have fewer life-threatening bleeding events compared to warfarin additionally , patients aged 80 years or more may be especially susceptible to bleeding complications , with a rate of 13 bleeds per 100 person-years bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and noac therapy due to the fact that all noacs , to some extent , are excreted by the kidneys in people with cancer , a systematic review has found warfarin had no effect on death rate or the risk of blood clots apixaban had no effect on mortality , recurrence of blood clots in blood vessels or major bleeding or minor bleeding , however this finding comes only from one study nonhemorrhagic adverse events are less common than hemorrhagic adverse events but should still be monitored closely the exact pathogenesis of skin necrosis and limb gangrene are not completely understood but are believed to be associated with warfarin 's effect on inhibiting production of protein c and protein s purple toe syndrome typically develops three to eight weeks after initiation of warfarin therapy immune-mediated hit most commonly arises five to ten days after exposure to heparin pathogenesis of immune-mediated hit is believed to be caused by heparin-dependent immunoglobulin antibodies binding to platelet factor 4/heparin complexes on platelets , leading to wide spread platelet activation multivitamins that do not interact with clotting are available for patients on anticoagulants these include alfalfa , avocado , cat 's claw , coenzyme q10 , and dark leafy greens such as spinach anticoagulants are often used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis a number of anticoagulants are available since the 2000s a number of agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as directly acting oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) , novel oral anticoagulants ( noacs ) , or non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants the newer anticoagulants ( noacs/doacs ) , are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used with care in patients with kidney problems a prominent member of this class is warfarin ( coumadin ) and was found to be the dominant anticoagulant prescribed in a large multispecialty practice there are three major categories of heparin : unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) , low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) , and ultra-low-molecular weight heparin ( ulmwh ) the activated at then inactivates factor xa , thrombin , and other coagulation factors heparin can be used in vivo ( by injection ) , and also in vitro to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices however , with regards to doacs and invasive dental treatments , there has not been enough clinical evidence and experience to prove any reliable adverse-effects , relevance or interaction between these two in general , vitamin k is most commonly used in order to reverse the effect of warfarin in non-urgent settings idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody , approved by the us fda in 2015 , that reverses effect of dabigatran by binding to both free and thrombin-bound dabigatran a bethesda unit ( bu ) is a measure of blood coagulation inhibitor activity detecting overdose an overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term , in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , or edoxaban ) and undergoing dental treatment ( in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding ) , no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required

the use of anticoagulants is a decision based upon the risks and benefits of anticoagulation the biggest risk of anticoagulation therapy is the increased risk of bleeding in otherwise healthy people , the increased risk of bleeding is minimal , but those who have had recent surgery , cerebral aneurysms , and other conditions may have too great of risk of bleeding the risk of bleeding using the aforementioned risk assessment tools must then be weighed against thrombotic risk in order to formally determine patient 's overall benefit in starting anticoagulation therapy the most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding , both nonmajor and major bleeding events risk of bleeding is dependent on the class of anticoagulant agent used , patient 's age , and pre-existing health conditions warfarin has an estimated incidence of bleeding of 15-20 % per year and life-threatening bleeding rate of 1-3 % per year newer non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants appear to have fewer life-threatening bleeding events compared to warfarin thus , patients with renal impairment may be at higher risk of increased bleeding in people with cancer , a systematic review has found warfarin had no effect on death rate or the risk of blood clots however it did increase the risk of major bleeding in 107 more people per 1000 population and minor bleeding in 167 more people in 1000 population purple toe syndrome typically develops three to eight weeks after initiation of warfarin therapy pathogenesis of immune-mediated hit is believed to be caused by heparin-dependent immunoglobulin antibodies binding to platelet factor 4/heparin complexes on platelets , leading to wide spread platelet activation many herbal supplements have blood-thinning properties , such as danshen and feverfew grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs , increasing the amount of time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body , and so should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs anticoagulants are often used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis people using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way the newer anticoagulants ( noacs/doacs ) , are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used with care in patients with kidney problems a prominent member of this class is warfarin ( coumadin ) and was found to be the dominant anticoagulant prescribed in a large multispecialty practice in venipuncture , vacutainer brand blood collecting tubes containing heparin usually have a green cap lmwh exhibits higher anti-xa/anti-iia activity ratio and is useful as it does not require monitoring of the aptt coagulation parameter and has fewer side effects the directly acting oral anticoagulants ( doacs ) were introduced on and after 2008 betrixaban is significant as it is the only oral factor xa inhibitor approved by the fda for use in acutely medically ill patients complex extractions , adjacent extractions leading to large wound or more than three extractions ) , the recommended practice is for patient to miss or delay a dose of their doac before such procedures so as to minimize the effect on bleeding risk the antithrombin protein itself is used as a protein therapeutic that can be purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly ( for example , atryn , which is produced in the milk of genetic engineering goats with the growing number of patients taking oral anticoagulation therapy , studies into reversal agents are gaining increasing interest due to major bleeding events and need for urgent anticoagulant reversal therapy in addition , test tubes used for laboratory blood tests will have chemicals added to stop blood clotting detecting overdose an overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term , in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure , dabigatran , rivaroxaban , apixaban , or edoxaban ) and undergoing dental treatment ( in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding ) , no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required the most promising ones act on the contact activation system ( factor xiia and factor xia ) ; it is anticipated that this may provide agents that prevent thrombosis without conferring a risk of bleeding .

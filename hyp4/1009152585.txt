the use of anticoagulants is a decision based upon the risks and benefits of anticoagulation the biggest risk of anticoagulation therapy is the increased risk of bleeding in otherwise healthy people , the increased risk of bleeding is minimal , but those who have had recent surgery , cerebral aneurysms , and other conditions may have too great of risk of bleeding the most serious and common adverse side effect associated with anticoagulant are increased risk of bleeding , both nonmajor and major bleeding events newer non-vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants appear to have fewer life-threatening bleeding events compared to warfarin bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and noac therapy due to the fact that all noacs , to some extent , are excreted by the kidneys thus , patients with renal impairment may be at higher risk of increased bleeding in people with cancer , a systematic review has found warfarin had no effect on death rate or the risk of blood clots however it did increase the risk of major bleeding in 107 more people per 1000 population and minor bleeding in 167 more people in 1000 population apixaban had no effect on mortality , recurrence of blood clots in blood vessels or major bleeding or minor bleeding , however this finding comes only from one study nonhemorrhagic adverse events are less common than hemorrhagic adverse events but should still be monitored closely nonhemorrhagic adverse events of warfarin include skin necrosis , limb gangrene , and purple toe syndrome warfarin 's interference of g1a proteins have also been linked to abnormalities in fetal bone development in mothers who were treated with warfarin during pregnancy grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs , increasing the amount of time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body , and so should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs anticoagulants are often used to treat acute deep vein thrombosis people using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way , which cites bed rest while using anticoagulants can harm patients in circumstances in which it is not medically necessary these agents include direct thrombin inhibitor ( dabigatran ) and factor xa inhibitor ( rivaroxaban , apixaban , betrixaban and edoxaban ) and they have been shown to be as good or possibly better than the coumarins with less serious side effects the newer anticoagulants ( noacs/doacs ) , are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used with care in patients with kidney problems a prominent member of this class is warfarin ( coumadin ) and was found to be the dominant anticoagulant prescribed in a large multispecialty practice where an immediate effect is required , heparin must be given concomitantly heparin can be used in vivo ( by injection ) , and also in vitro to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices in venipuncture , vacutainer brand blood collecting tubes containing heparin usually have a green cap they were also previously referred to as '' new/novel '' and '' non-vitamin k antagonist '' oral anticoagulants ( noacs ) doacs are a lot more expensive than warfarin , after having taken into consideration the cost of frequent blood testing associated with warfarin current members of this class include the bivalent drugs hirudin , lepirudin , and bivalirudin ; and the monovalent drugs argatroban and dabigatran as in any invasive procedures , patients on anticoagulation therapy have increased risk for bleeding and caution should be used along with local hemostasis methods to minimize bleeding risk during the operation as well as post-operatively specifically with warfarin , four factor pcc ( 4f-pcc ) has been shown to have superior safety and mortality benefits compared to fpp in lowering inr levels citrate is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests , as well as in blood transfusion bags detecting overdose an overdose in anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in a long term , in order to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure

increasing globalization has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages common languages are used in areas such as trade , tourism , international relations , technology , media , and science many countries such as korea ( kim yeong-seo , 2009 ) , japan ( kubota , 1998 ) and china ( kirkpatrick & zhichang , 2002 ) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels however , some countries such as india , singapore , malaysia , pakistan , and the philippines use a second official language in their governments according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language the need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself for many centuries , latin was the dominant language of education , commerce , religion , and government in much of europe , but it was displaced for many purposes by french , italian , and english by the end of the 16th century he wrote a complete course for learning latin , covering the entire school curriculum , culminating in his opera didactica omnia , 1657 he held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience the study of latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum '' grammar schools '' from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of classical latin the study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of european schools until the 18th century oral work was minimal , and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century it led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods , each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods universities who have a foreign language as a major attain '' minimum professional proficiency '' most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past , often ending with the author 's new method these new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author 's mind , as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method for example , descriptive linguists seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work ( which led to the audio-lingual method developed for the u.s & nbsp ; 5 ) there have been two major branches in the field of language learning , the empirical and theoretical , and these have almost completely separate histories , with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another these have led to a wider variety of teaching methods , ranging from the grammar-translation method and gouin 's '' series method '' to the direct methods of berlitz and de sauz√© with these methods , students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar this follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species this allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken over time , language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world in some countries , such as the united states , language education ( also referred to as world languages ) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as english , maths and science in some countries , such as australia , it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to lote or language other than english english as a second language ( esl ) is also available for students whose first language is not english and they are unable to speak it to the required standard teaching foreign language in classrooms language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized language school there are three principal '' approaches '' : the structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning ( e.g the interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations , focusing on patterns of moves , acts , negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges a technique ( or strategy ) is a very specific , concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective hundreds of languages are available for self-study , from scores of publishers , for a range of costs , using a variety of methods most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner 's own language , , , , , the only language in such recordings is the target language , and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner 's native language software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty , until the concepts are mastered software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures instead of oral explanations the only language in such software is the target language websites provide various services geared toward language education language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency , fluency , colloquial vocabulary acquisition , and vernacular usage , rather than formal grammar or writing skills there is an annual international education perfect languages contest held in may in a study conducted by the center for applied linguistics , it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in massively multiplayer online games and virtual worlds language learning strategies have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition clearly listening is used to learn , but not all language learners employ it consciously focused listening is very important when learning a foreign language as the slightest accent on a word can change the meaning completely language learners can gain experience in speaking foreign languages through in-person language classes , language meet-ups , university language exchange programs , joining online language learning communities ( e.g there are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing , based on looking for contextual clues , spaced repetition with a use of various apps , games and tools ( e.g blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with distance education , frequently electronic , either computer-based or web-based in this period , the most professional foreign language education and academic atmosphere are provided to the students . materials and e-learning for minority language education directions and prospects for educational linguistics

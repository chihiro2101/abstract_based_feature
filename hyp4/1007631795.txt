increasing globalization has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages many countries such as korea ( kim yeong-seo , 2009 ) , japan ( kubota , 1998 ) and china ( kirkpatrick & zhichang , 2002 ) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language the need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself for many centuries , latin was the dominant language of education , commerce , religion , and government in much of europe , but it was displaced for many purposes by french , italian , and english by the end of the 16th century in this work , comenius also outlined his theory of language acquisition he is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages he held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience he published the world 's first illustrated children 's book , orbis sensualium pictus the study of latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum it was then claimed that the study of latin developed intellectual ability , and the study of latin grammar became an end in and of itself '' grammar schools '' from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of classical latin based on the purely academic study of latin , students of modern languages did much of the same exercises , studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences oral work was minimal , and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language this tradition-inspired method became known as the grammar translation innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century it led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods , each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods even the '' reading knowledge '' required for a phd degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read , and only very few researchers who are native english speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than english however , anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find , leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs older methods and approaches such as the grammar translation method and the direct method are dismissed and even ridiculed , as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as the only and complete solution to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students most books on language teaching list the various methods that have been used in the past , often ending with the author 's new method it is also often inferred or even stated that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out completely , though in reality even the oldest methods are still in use ( e.g & nbsp ; 5 ) there have been two major branches in the field of language learning , the empirical and theoretical , and these have almost completely separate histories , with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another these methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling in its most extreme form , language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species , human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species de sauzé , whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by noam chomsky and others with these methods , students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar in some countries , such as the united states , language education ( also referred to as world languages ) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as english , maths and science in some countries , such as australia , it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to lote or language other than english in the majority of english-speaking education centers , french , spanish , and german are the most popular languages to study and learn there are many methods of teaching languages an approach is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning , but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting examples of structural methods are grammar translation and the audio-lingual method audio recordings use native speakers , and one strength is helping learners improve their accent others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice , similar to learning a song audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching , and have been produced on records , tapes , cds , dvds and websites most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner 's own language an alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language language books have been published for centuries , teaching vocabulary and grammar software can interact with learners in ways that books and audio can not : some software records the learner , analyzes the pronunciation , and gives feedback the only language in such software is the target language websites provide various services geared toward language education some sites are designed specifically for learning languages : some software runs on the web itself , with the advantage of avoiding downloads , and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools across australasia , 'education perfect ' – an online learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students ' progress as students gain a '' point '' for every new word remembered with the help of the internet , students are readily exposed to foreign media ( music videos , television shows , films ) and as a result , teachers are taking heed of the internet 's influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in massively multiplayer online games and virtual worlds language learning strategies have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be employed alongside listening and reading exercises , practicing conversation skills is an important aspect of language acquisition for example , playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers ( 1 to 10 ) early childhood is the fastest and most critical period for one to master language in their life in this period , the most professional foreign language education and academic atmosphere are provided to the students bilingual education has been implemented in many countries including the united states , in order to promote both the use and appreciation of the minority language , as well as the majority language concerned foreign language education : whose definition ?

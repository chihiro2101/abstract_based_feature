increasing globalization has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages common languages are used in areas such as trade , tourism , international relations , technology , media , and science many countries such as korea ( kim yeong-seo , 2009 ) , japan ( kubota , 1998 ) and china ( kirkpatrick & zhichang , 2002 ) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels however , some countries such as india , singapore , malaysia , pakistan , and the philippines use a second official language in their governments according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language the need to learn foreign languages is as old as human history itself in the ancient near east , akkadian was the language of diplomacy , as in the amarna letters for many centuries , latin was the dominant language of education , commerce , religion , and government in much of europe , but it was displaced for many purposes by french , italian , and english by the end of the 16th century in this work , comenius also outlined his theory of language acquisition he is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages it was then claimed that the study of latin developed intellectual ability , and the study of latin grammar became an end in and of itself '' grammar schools '' from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of classical latin the study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of european schools until the 18th century based on the purely academic study of latin , students of modern languages did much of the same exercises , studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century it led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods , each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods even the '' reading knowledge '' required for a phd degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read , and only very few researchers who are native english speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than english however , anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find , leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs this tends to make the research of second language acquisition emotionally charged proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy & nbsp ; 5 ) there have been two major branches in the field of language learning , the empirical and theoretical , and these have almost completely separate histories , with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another these methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling in its most extreme form , language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species , human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species de sauz√© , whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by noam chomsky and others this follows from the rationalist position that man is born to think and that language use is a uniquely human trait impossible in other species over time , language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world in some countries , such as the united states , language education ( also referred to as world languages ) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as english , maths and science in some countries , such as australia , it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to lote or language other than english english as a second language ( esl ) is also available for students whose first language is not english and they are unable to speak it to the required standard teaching foreign language in classrooms some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used ; still others have a small following , but offer useful insights an approach is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning , but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching hundreds of languages are available for self-study , from scores of publishers , for a range of costs , using a variety of methods the course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology , just as classroom teachers do others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice , similar to learning a song most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner 's own language an alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language , , , , , the only language in such recordings is the target language , and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner 's native language more complete books include more vocabulary , grammar , exercises , translation , and writing practice also , various other '' language learning tools '' have been entering the market in recent years software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty , until the concepts are mastered software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures instead of oral explanations the only language in such software is the target language it is comprehensible regardless of the learner 's native language websites provide various services geared toward language education some sites are designed specifically for learning languages : some software runs on the web itself , with the advantage of avoiding downloads , and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools language learning strategies have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition for example , playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers ( 1 to 10 ) in addition , more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing how one learns have been applied to language classrooms as long as we are good at guiding and creating opportunities for children , children 's language ability is easy to be developed and cultivated ingrid piller , how can we change language habits ? , language on the move , august 1 , 2018 with the increasing prevalence of international business transactions , it is now important to have multiple languages at one 's disposal bilingual education has been implemented in many countries including the united states , in order to promote both the use and appreciation of the minority language , as well as the majority language concerned foreign language education : whose definition ?

common languages are used in areas such as trade , tourism , international relations , technology , media , and science however , some countries such as india , singapore , malaysia , pakistan , and the philippines use a second official language in their governments according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language for many centuries , latin was the dominant language of education , commerce , religion , and government in much of europe , but it was displaced for many purposes by french , italian , and english by the end of the 16th century in this work , comenius also outlined his theory of language acquisition he held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience he published the world 's first illustrated children 's book , orbis sensualium pictus '' grammar schools '' from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of classical latin the study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of european schools until the 18th century based on the purely academic study of latin , students of modern languages did much of the same exercises , studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences oral work was minimal , and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century the history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching ( such as those related below ) might appear to be a history of failure however , anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find , leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs this tends to make the research of second language acquisition emotionally charged these new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author 's mind , as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method for example , descriptive linguists seem to claim unhesitatingly that there were no scientifically based language teaching methods before their work ( which led to the audio-lingual method developed for the u.s the berlitz version of the direct method ) this was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances , which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work & nbsp ; 5 ) there have been two major branches in the field of language learning , the empirical and theoretical , and these have almost completely separate histories , with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another these methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling in its most extreme form , language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species , human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species de sauzé , whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by noam chomsky and others these have led to a wider variety of teaching methods , ranging from the grammar-translation method and gouin 's '' series method '' to the direct methods of berlitz and de sauzé with these methods , students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar the rivalry between the two camps is intense , with little communication or cooperation between them over time , language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world in some countries , such as the united states , language education ( also referred to as world languages ) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as english , maths and science in some countries , such as australia , it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to lote or language other than english english as a second language ( esl ) is also available for students whose first language is not english and they are unable to speak it to the required standard teaching foreign language in classrooms language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized language school while sometimes confused , the terms '' approach '' , '' method '' and '' technique '' are hierarchical concepts the interactive view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations , focusing on patterns of moves , acts , negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges a method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned , and should be based upon a selected approach . online and self-study courses hundreds of languages are available for self-study , from scores of publishers , for a range of costs , using a variety of methods the course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology , just as classroom teachers do audio recordings use native speakers , and one strength is helping learners improve their accent audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching , and have been produced on records , tapes , cds , dvds and websites most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner 's own language language books have been published for centuries , teaching vocabulary and grammar also , various other '' language learning tools '' have been entering the market in recent years software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures instead of oral explanations the only language in such software is the target language websites provide various services geared toward language education some sites are designed specifically for learning languages : some software runs on the web itself , with the advantage of avoiding downloads , and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection for example , various travel guides , for example lonely planet , offer software supporting language education some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts language exchange websites essentially treat knowledge of a language as a commodity , and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged their mastery of language is largely acquired naturally by living in a verbal communication environment as long as we are good at guiding and creating opportunities for children , children 's language ability is easy to be developed and cultivated learning a foreign language during adulthood means one is pursuing a higher value of themself by obtaining a new skill bilingual education has been implemented in many countries including the united states , in order to promote both the use and appreciation of the minority language , as well as the majority language concerned see also : english language learning and teaching for information on language teaching acronyms and abbreviations which are specific to english

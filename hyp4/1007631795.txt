however , some countries such as india , singapore , malaysia , pakistan , and the philippines use a second official language in their governments according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language for many centuries , latin was the dominant language of education , commerce , religion , and government in much of europe , but it was displaced for many purposes by french , italian , and english by the end of the 16th century john amos comenius was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend he wrote a complete course for learning latin , covering the entire school curriculum , culminating in his opera didactica omnia , 1657 he is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages he held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience the study of latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum it was then claimed that the study of latin developed intellectual ability , and the study of latin grammar became an end in and of itself advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric based on the purely academic study of latin , students of modern languages did much of the same exercises , studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences oral work was minimal , and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century the earliest applied linguists included jean manes ca , heinrich gottfried ollendorff ( 1803–1865 ) , henry sweet ( 1845–1912 ) , otto jespersen ( 1860–1943 ) , and harold palmer ( 1877–1949 ) even the '' reading knowledge '' required for a phd degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read , and only very few researchers who are native english speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than english this tends to make the research of second language acquisition emotionally charged proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy this was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances , which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work & nbsp ; 5 ) there have been two major branches in the field of language learning , the empirical and theoretical , and these have almost completely separate histories , with each gaining ground over the other at one time or another these methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling in its most extreme form , language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species , human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species de sauzé , whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by noam chomsky and others this allows us to create sentences that we have never heard before but that can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being spoken in some countries , such as australia , it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to lote or language other than english in the majority of english-speaking education centers , french , spanish , and german are the most popular languages to study and learn language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized language school some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used ; still others have a small following , but offer useful insights an approach is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning , but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting such can be related to second language acquisition theory a method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned , and should be based upon a selected approach examples of structural methods are grammar translation and the audio-lingual method examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching a technique ( or strategy ) is a very specific , concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner 's own language amazing hear-say , by donald rivera , penton overseas inc , , , , , the only language in such recordings is the target language , and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner 's native language more complete books include more vocabulary , grammar , exercises , translation , and writing practice software can present additional exercises in areas where a particular learner has difficulty , until the concepts are mastered software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures instead of oral explanations websites provide various services geared toward language education some sites are designed specifically for learning languages : some software runs on the web itself , with the advantage of avoiding downloads , and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection for example , various travel guides , for example lonely planet , offer software supporting language education some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency , fluency , colloquial vocabulary acquisition , and vernacular usage , rather than formal grammar or writing skills in a study conducted by the center for applied linguistics , it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language course development and learning management systems such as moodle are used by teachers , including language teachers in addition , spain 's language and cultural institute instituto cervantes has an '' island '' on second life some internet content is free , often from government and nonprofit sites such as bbc online , book2 , foreign service institute , with no or minimal ads language learning strategies have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening andrew weiler : focused listening is not something that most learners employ as a strategy compulsory education , for most people , is the period that they have access to a second or foreign language for the first time see also : english language learning and teaching for information on language teaching acronyms and abbreviations which are specific to english strategic language learning.multilingual matters : canada , 2010 kim yeong-seo ( 2009 ) '' history of english education in korea '' kirkpatrick , a & zhichang , x ( 2002 )

increasing globalization has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages common languages are used in areas such as trade , tourism , international relations , technology , media , and science many countries such as korea ( kim yeong-seo , 2009 ) , japan ( kubota , 1998 ) and china ( kirkpatrick & zhichang , 2002 ) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels however , some countries such as india , singapore , malaysia , pakistan , and the philippines use a second official language in their governments according to gao ( 2010 ) , china has recently been putting enormous importance on foreign language learning , especially the english language for many centuries , latin was the dominant language of education , commerce , religion , and government in much of europe , but it was displaced for many purposes by french , italian , and english by the end of the 16th century john amos comenius was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend he wrote a complete course for learning latin , covering the entire school curriculum , culminating in his opera didactica omnia , 1657 in this work , comenius also outlined his theory of language acquisition he is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about methods for teaching languages the study of latin gradually diminished from the study of a living language to a mere subject in the school curriculum it was then claimed that the study of latin developed intellectual ability , and the study of latin grammar became an end in and of itself based on the purely academic study of latin , students of modern languages did much of the same exercises , studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences oral work was minimal , and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century it led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods , each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods they worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories , but they left many of the specific practical details for others to devise however , anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find , leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of most language programs these new methods are usually presented as coming only from the author 's mind , as the authors generally give no credence to what was done before and do not explain how it relates to the new method these methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and drilling in its most extreme form , language learning is seen as much the same as any other learning in any other species , human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species with these methods , students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar over time , language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world in some countries , such as australia , it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to lote or language other than english in the majority of english-speaking education centers , french , spanish , and german are the most popular languages to study and learn language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized language school there are many methods of teaching languages while sometimes confused , the terms '' approach '' , '' method '' and '' technique '' are hierarchical concepts an approach is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning , but does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented into the classroom setting such can be related to second language acquisition theory there are three principal '' approaches '' : the structural view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning ( e.g the functional view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function , such as requesting something in order for an approach to be translated into a method , an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning , how the content is to be selected and organized , the types of tasks to be performed , the roles of students , and the roles of teachers examples of structural methods are grammar translation and the audio-lingual method examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching a technique ( or strategy ) is a very specific , concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective such are derived from the controlling method , and less directly , from the approach others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice , similar to learning a song audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching , and have been produced on records , tapes , cds , dvds and websites most audio recordings teach words in the target language by using explanations in the learner 's own language an alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language , , , , , the only language in such recordings is the target language , and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner 's native language more complete books include more vocabulary , grammar , exercises , translation , and writing practice also , various other '' language learning tools '' have been entering the market in recent years software can pronounce words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures instead of oral explanations for example , various travel guides , for example lonely planet , offer software supporting language education some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts language exchange websites essentially treat knowledge of a language as a commodity , and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency , fluency , colloquial vocabulary acquisition , and vernacular usage , rather than formal grammar or writing skills translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language practices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar suitable resources for teaching and learning minority languages can be difficult to find and access , which has led to calls for the increased development of materials for minority language teaching see also : english language learning and teaching for information on language teaching acronyms and

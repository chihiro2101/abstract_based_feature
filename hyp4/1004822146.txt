thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy all matter with a nonzero temperature is composed of particles with kinetic energy electromagnetic radiation , including visible light , will propagate indefinitely in vacuum the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law , it does not consist of only a single frequency , but comprises a continuous spectrum of photon energies , its characteristic spectrum the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation the ratio of any body 's emission relative to that of a black body is the body 's emissivity , so that a black body has an emissivity of unity ( i.e the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation thus , to thermal radiation it appears black the distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by planck 's law the photosphere of the sun , at a temperature of approximately 6000 & nbsp ; k , emits radiation principally in the ( human- ) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum earth 's surface emits the absorbed radiation , approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 & nbsp ; k with spectral peak at f max at these lower frequencies , the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earth 's surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere some of the photons emitted by a tungsten light bulb filament at 3000 & nbsp ; k are in the visible spectrum whenever em radiation is emitted and then absorbed , heat is transferred even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k , 99 % of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared for example , although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent , near-field thermal radiation ( i.e black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101

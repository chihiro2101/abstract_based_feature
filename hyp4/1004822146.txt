thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy thermal energy is the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths , it is characterized as a black body the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation the ratio of any body 's emission relative to that of a black body is the body 's emissivity , so that a black body has an emissivity of unity ( i.e the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation the photosphere of the sun , at a temperature of approximately 6000 & nbsp ; k , emits radiation principally in the ( human- ) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum earth 's surface emits the absorbed radiation , approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 & nbsp ; k with spectral peak at f max some of the photons emitted by a tungsten light bulb filament at 3000 & nbsp ; k are in the visible spectrum instead of mirrors , fresnel lenses can also be used to concentrate radiant energy emissivities at those wavelengths are largely unrelated to visual emissivities ( visible colors ) ; in the far infra-red , most objects have high emissivities low-emissivity windows in houses are a more complicated technology , since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light there are 4 main properties that characterize thermal radiation ( in the limit of the far field ) : thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies the rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source , a property known as reciprocity indeed , thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves ( far-field , or electromagnetic radiation ) into account for example , although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent , near-field thermal radiation ( i.e black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101

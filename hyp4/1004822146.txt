thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy all matter with a nonzero temperature is composed of particles with kinetic energy electromagnetic radiation , including visible light , will propagate indefinitely in vacuum the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law the radiation is not monochromatic , i.e the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation absorptivity , reflectivity , and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation thus , to thermal radiation it appears black earth 's surface emits the absorbed radiation , approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 & nbsp ; k with spectral peak at f max at these lower frequencies , the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earth 's surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere some of the photons emitted by a tungsten light bulb filament at 3000 & nbsp ; k are in the visible spectrum whenever em radiation is emitted and then absorbed , heat is transferred the frequency distribution is given by planck 's law of black-body radiation for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at top the total radiative intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature , as expressed by the stefanâ€“boltzmann law for example , although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent , near-field thermal radiation ( i.e , radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths ) may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101

thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy electromagnetic radiation , including visible light , will propagate indefinitely in vacuum the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths , it is characterized as a black body the ratio of any body 's emission relative to that of a black body is the body 's emissivity , so that a black body has an emissivity of unity ( i.e however , its emissivity at a temperature of about , peak wavelength of about 12 micrometers , is 0.95 thus , to thermal radiation it appears black the distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by planck 's law wien 's displacement law , and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength , indicates that the peak frequency f max is proportional to the absolute temperature t of the black body the photosphere of the sun , at a temperature of approximately 6000 & nbsp ; k , emits radiation principally in the ( human- ) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum at these lower frequencies , the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earth 's surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere the incandescent light bulb has a spectrum overlapping the black body spectra of the sun and the earth personalized cooling technology is another example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial most conventional fabrics are opaque to infrared radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment there are 4 main properties that characterize thermal radiation ( in the limit of the far field ) : thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies the frequency distribution is given by planck 's law of black-body radiation for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at top the total amount of radiation of all frequency increases steeply as the temperature rises ; it grows as t 4 , where t is the absolute temperature of the body black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101

thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy thermal energy is the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter all matter with a nonzero temperature is composed of particles with kinetic energy electromagnetic radiation , including visible light , will propagate indefinitely in vacuum the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law the radiation is not monochromatic , i.e if the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths , it is characterized as a black body the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation thus , to thermal radiation it appears black at any given temperature , there is a frequency f max at which the power emitted is a maximum earth 's surface emits the absorbed radiation , approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 & nbsp ; k with spectral peak at f max most conventional fabrics are opaque to infrared radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment the dominant frequency ( or color ) range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases indeed , thermal radiation as discussed above takes only radiating waves ( far-field , or electromagnetic radiation ) into account for example , although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent , near-field thermal radiation ( i.e such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101

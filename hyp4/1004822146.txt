thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy thermal energy is the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter the characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating , including its temperature , its spectral emissivity , as expressed by kirchhoff 's law the radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation absorptivity , reflectivity , and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation the temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation the distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by planck 's law at any given temperature , there is a frequency f max at which the power emitted is a maximum the photosphere of the sun , at a temperature of approximately 6000 & nbsp ; k , emits radiation principally in the ( human- ) visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum earth 's atmosphere is partly transparent to visible light , and the light reaching the surface is absorbed or reflected earth 's surface emits the absorbed radiation , approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 & nbsp ; k with spectral peak at f max at these lower frequencies , the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from earth 's surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere the incandescent light bulb has a spectrum overlapping the black body spectra of the sun and the earth whenever em radiation is emitted and then absorbed , heat is transferred however , the human body is a very efficient emitter of infrared radiation , which provides an additional cooling mechanism even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 k , 99 % of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared the rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted at a given frequency is proportional to the amount of absorption that it would experience by the source , a property known as reciprocity black body emission calculator heat transfer atmospheric radiation infrared temperature calibration 101

mcmillan 's abrupt departure was caused by the outbreak of world war ii in europe in november 1940 , he began working at the mit radiation laboratory in cambridge , massachusetts , where he participated in the development and testing of airborne microwave radar during world war ii flying over the naval submarine base new london with luis walter alvarez and air chief marshal hugh dowding , they showed that the radar was able to detect the conning tower of a partly submerged submarine mcmillan joined the navy electronics laboratory near san diego in august 1941 this proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar , because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound in november he accompanied oppenheimer on a trip to new mexico on which the los alamos ranch school was selected as the site of the project 's weapons research laboratory , which became the los alamos laboratory wilson , established the test area known as the anchor ranch , and scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron the plutonium gun , codenamed thin man , needed a muzzle velocity of at least per second , which they hoped to achieve with a modified navy 3 '' /50 caliber gun a 184-inch cyclotron was under construction at the radiation laboratory , but he realised that a more efficient use could be made of the energy used to accelerate particles the laboratory was renamed the lawrence radiation laboratory in 1958 in 1970 , it split into the lawrence berkeley laboratory and the lawrence livermore laboratory , and mcmillan became director of the former '' the transuranium elements : early history ( nobel lecture ) '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( december 12 , 1951 ) '' notes on quadrupole focusing '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( february 9 , 1956 ) '' some thoughts on stability in nonlinear periodic focusing systems '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( september 5 , 1967 )

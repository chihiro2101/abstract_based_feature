in november 1940 , he began working at the mit radiation laboratory in cambridge , massachusetts , where he participated in the development and testing of airborne microwave radar during world war ii this proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar , because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound in november he accompanied oppenheimer on a trip to new mexico on which the los alamos ranch school was selected as the site of the project 's weapons research laboratory , which became the los alamos laboratory he recruited personnel for the laboratory , including richard feynman and robert r as the laboratory took shape , mcmillan became deputy head of the gun-type nuclear weapon effort under navy captain william s this would require expertise in explosives , and mcmillan urged oppenheimer to bring in george kistiakowsky kistiakowsky joined the laboratory on february 16 , 1944 , and parsons 's e ( explosives ) division was divided in two , with mcmillan as deputy for the gun and kistiakowsky as deputy for implosion mcmillan remained in charge of the gun-type weapon , which would now be used only with uranium-235 a 184-inch cyclotron was under construction at the radiation laboratory , but he realised that a more efficient use could be made of the energy used to accelerate particles by varying the magnetic field used , the particles could be made to move in stable orbits , and higher energies achieved with the same energy input in 1970 , it split into the lawrence berkeley laboratory and the lawrence livermore laboratory , and mcmillan became director of the former he served on the influential general advisory committee ( gac ) of the atomic energy commission from 1954 to 1958 , and the commission on high energy physics of the international union of pure and applied physics from 1960 to 1967 '' notes on quadrupole focusing '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( february 9 , 1956 ) '' some thoughts on stability in nonlinear periodic focusing systems '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( september 5 , 1967 )

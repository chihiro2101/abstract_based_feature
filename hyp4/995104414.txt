in november 1940 , he began working at the mit radiation laboratory in cambridge , massachusetts , where he participated in the development and testing of airborne microwave radar during world war ii mcmillan married elsie walford blumer in new haven , connecticut , on june 7 , 1941 the idea , which came from lawrence , was to use sonar to build up a visual image of the surrounding water this proved to be far more difficult that doing so with radar , because of objects in the water and variations in water temperature that caused variations in the speed of sound oppenheimer recruited mcmillan to join the manhattan project , the wartime effort to create atomic bombs , in september 1942 as the laboratory took shape , mcmillan became deputy head of the gun-type nuclear weapon effort under navy captain william s kistiakowsky joined the laboratory on february 16 , 1944 , and parsons 's e ( explosives ) division was divided in two , with mcmillan as deputy for the gun and kistiakowsky as deputy for implosion in july 1944 , oppenheimer reorganised the laboratory to make an all-out effort on implosion mcmillan remained in charge of the gun-type weapon , which would now be used only with uranium-235 a 184-inch cyclotron was under construction at the radiation laboratory , but he realised that a more efficient use could be made of the energy used to accelerate particles the phase stability principle was tested with the old 37-inch cyclotron at berkeley after mcmillan returned to the radiation laboratory in september 1945 he served on the influential general advisory committee ( gac ) of the atomic energy commission from 1954 to 1958 , and the commission on high energy physics of the international union of pure and applied physics from 1960 to 1967 '' focusing in linear accelerators '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( august 24 , 1950 ) '' the transuranium elements : early history ( nobel lecture ) '' , university of california radiation laboratory , lawrence berkeley national laboratory , united states department of energy ( through predecessor agency the atomic energy commission ) , ( december 12 , 1951 )

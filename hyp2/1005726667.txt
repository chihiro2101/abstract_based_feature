in 2012 , social psychologists benjamin karney , harry reis , and others published an analysis of online dating in psychological science in the public interest that concluded that the matching algorithms of online dating services are only negligibly better at matching people than if they were matched at random in 2014 , kang zhao at the university of iowa constructed a new approach based on the algorithms used by amazon and netflix , based on recommendations rather than the autobiographical notes of match seekers nevertheless , it is still not known what the algorithm for finding the perfect match would be opinions and usage of online dating services also differ widely a 2005 study of data collected by the pew internet & american life project found that individuals are more likely to use an online dating service if they use the internet for a greater number of tasks , and less likely to use such a service if they are trusting of others under this metaphor , members of a given service can both '' shop '' for potential relationship partners and '' sell '' themselves in hopes of finding a successful match attitudes towards online dating improved visibly between 2005 and 2015 , the pew research center found in particular , the number of people who thought that online dating was a good way to meet people rose from 44 % in 2005 to 59 % in 2015 whereas those who believed that people to used online dating services were desperate fell from 29 % to 23 % during the same period although only a negligible number of people dated online in 2005 , that rose to 11 % in 2013 and then 15 % in 2015 in particular , the number of american adults who had used an online dating site went from 9 % in 2013 to 12 % in 2015 while those who used an online dating software application on their mobile phones jumped from 3 % to 9 % during the same period nevertheless , only one in three had actually gone out on a date with someone they met online only five out of a hundred said they were married to or in a committed long-term relationship with someone they met online online daters may have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population in the united states according to a 2015 study by the pew research center , people who had used online dating services had a higher opinion of such services than those who had not 80 % of the users said that online dating sites are a good way to meet potential partners , compared to 55 % of non-users in addition , online daters felt that online dating is easier more efficient than other methods ( 61 % ) , and gives access to a larger pool of potential partners ( 62 % ) , compared to 44 % and 50 % of non-users , respectively nevertheless , a similar number of online daters ( 31 % ) and non-users ( 32 % ) agreed that online dating kept people from settling down safety was , however , the exception , with 53 % of women and only 38 % of men expressing concern it is not clear that social networking service and online dating services are leading to the formation of long-term intimate relationships more efficiently online dating services offer goldmines of information for social scientists studying human mating behavior chinese men favor women working as primary school teachers and nurses while chinese women prefer men in the it or finance industry this is because of the social pressure in china on '' leftover women , '' meaning those in their late 20s but still not married in fact , while 29 % of white men wanted to date only white women , 64 % of white women were willing to date white men only of those who stated a racial preference , 97 % of white men excluded black women , 48 % latinas , and 53 % asian women similarly , 92 % of white women exclude black men , 77 % exclude latinos , and 93 % exclude asian men in short , after opposite-sex members of their own group , white men were open to dating asian women , white women and black men than members of other racial or ethnic groups body type , however , was not a predictor for white women 's avoidance of asian men , nor was it for the white men 's preferences on the other hand , white men with a particular body type in mind were considerably more likely to exclude black women while women who preferred a particular height were slightly more likely to exclude asian men women who deemed themselves very liberal or liberal were less likely than apolitical , moderate , or conservative women to exclude black men white men with a religious preference were four times as likely to exclude black women , and white women with the same were twice as likely to exclude black men '' on the other hand , white women 's exclusion of asian men correlated with the stereotype that the latter were asexual or lacked masculinity whereas their preferring black men corresponded with the latter 's positive portrayal in the media as '' independent and respected in a separate paper from 2011 analyzing the same data set , cynthia feliciano and belinda robnett found in general , gender was a predictor of openness to dating outside of one 's racial or ethnic group , with 74 % of women and 58 % of men stating a racial preference , though there was considerable variation among each latinos were quite open to out-dating , with only 15 % of men and 16 % of women preferring to date only other latinos therefore , all groups except white women were willing to out-date , albeit with great variations 55 % of latino men excluded asian women while 73 % of asian women excluded latino men '' bruch and newman found that while people spent a lot of time crafting lengthy messages to those they considered to be a highly desirable partner , this hardly made a difference , judging by the response rate furthermore , knowing a large amount of superficial information about a potential partner 's interests may lead to a false sense of security when meeting up with a new person when one gets into the specialty niche websites where the primary demographic is male , one typically gets a very unbalanced ratio of male to female or female to male there is some evidence that there may be differences in how women online rate male attractiveness as opposed to how men rate female attractiveness former employees alleged match routinely and intentionally over-represented the number of active members on the website and a huge percentage were not real members but 'filler profiles' however , users were unable to respond to these messages without upgrading to a paid membership

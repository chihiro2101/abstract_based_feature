the main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate , which is a mixture of various isooctanes gal is commonly used in america for weight and balance computation nav canada , november 23 , 2006 avgas has an emission factor ( or factor ) of of carbon dioxide or about 3.07 units of weight produced per unit weight of fuel used avgas is less volatile , with a reid vapor pressure range of 5.5 to 7 psi , than automotive gasoline , with a range of 8 to 14 psi the upper limits are related to atmospheric pressure at sea level , 14.7 psi , for motor vehicles and ambient pressure at 22,000 ft , 6.25 psi , for aircraft the high octane ratings were traditionally achieved by the addition of tetraethyllead , a highly toxic substance that was tetraethyllead phaseout and ban in the late 20th century ) because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive , the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used ; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum historically , many post-wwii developed , low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels ; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel has not yet been developed and certified for most of these engines some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels , but some do not , and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation the annual us usage of avgas was in 2008 , and was approximately 0.14 % of the motor gasoline consumption however , prices are so high that there have been efforts to convert to diesel fuel , which is more readily available , less expensive , and has advantages for aviation use the first number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to '' aviation lean '' standards , which is similar to the anti-knock index or '' pump rating '' given to automotive gasoline in the us the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure for example , 100/130 avgas has an octane rating of 100 at the lean settings usually used for cruising and 130 at the rich settings used for take-off and other full-power conditions the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives by may 2012 , the us federal aviation administration ( faa unleaded avgas transition rulemaking committee ) had put together a plan in conjunction with industry to replace leaded avgas with an unleaded alternative within 11 years unleaded 94 motor octane fuel ( ul94 ) is essentially 100ll without the lead in march 2009 , teledyne continental motors ( tcm ) announced they had tested a 94ul fuel that might be the best replacement for 100ll this 94ul meets the avgas specification including vapor pressure but has not been completely tested for detonation qualities in all continental engines or under all conditions flight testing has been conducted in an io-550-b powering a beechcraft bonanza and ground testing in continental o-200 , 240 , o-470 , and o-520 engines in november 2015 , ul94 was added as a secondary grade of unleaded aviation gasoline to astm d7547 , which is the specification that governs ul91 unleaded avgas ul94 meets all of the same specification property limits as 100ll with the exception of a lower motor octane number ( 94.0 minimum for ul94 vs ul94 has a minimum motor octane number ( mon , which is the octane rating employed for grading aviation gasoline ) of 94.0 on april 6 , 2017 , lycoming engines published service instruction 1070v , which adds ul94 as an approved grade of fuel for dozens of engine models , 60 % of which are carbureted engines cringely attracted popular attention to the fuel , as also did a cross-country swift-fueled flight by the aopa 's dave hirschman in december 2013 shell oil announced that they had developed an unleaded 100 octane fuel and will submit it for faa testing with certification expected within two to three years

the main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate , which is a mixture of various isooctanes nav canada , november 23 , 2006 avgas has an emission factor ( or factor ) of of carbon dioxide or about 3.07 units of weight produced per unit weight of fuel used avgas is less volatile , with a reid vapor pressure range of 5.5 to 7 psi , than automotive gasoline , with a range of 8 to 14 psi the high octane ratings were traditionally achieved by the addition of tetraethyllead , a highly toxic substance that was tetraethyllead phaseout and ban in the late 20th century ) because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive , the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used ; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum historically , many post-wwii developed , low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels ; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel has not yet been developed and certified for most of these engines some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels , but some do not , and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used according to their august 2017 chart , a number of their engines are compatible with unleaded fuel however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation meanwhile , teledyne continental motors indicates ( in document x30548r3 most recently revised in 2008 ) that leaded avgas is required in their engines : '' current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded astm d910 fuels the use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear due to the lack of lead with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours however , prices are so high that there have been efforts to convert to diesel fuel , which is more readily available , less expensive , and has advantages for aviation use the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives in november 2008 , national air transportation association president jim coyne indicated that the environmental impact of aviation is expected to be a big issue over the next few years and will result in the phasing out of 100ll because of its lead content unleaded 94 motor octane fuel ( ul94 ) is essentially 100ll without the lead flight testing has been conducted in an io-550-b powering a beechcraft bonanza and ground testing in continental o-200 , 240 , o-470 , and o-520 engines in november 2015 , ul94 was added as a secondary grade of unleaded aviation gasoline to astm d7547 , which is the specification that governs ul91 unleaded avgas ul94 meets all of the same specification property limits as 100ll with the exception of a lower motor octane number ( 94.0 minimum for ul94 vs since may 2016 , ul94 , now a product of swift fuels , is available for sale at dozens of us airports ul94 has a minimum motor octane number ( mon , which is the octane rating employed for grading aviation gasoline ) of 94.0 the minimum aki of ul94 , as sold by swift fuels , is 98.0 '' in august 2016 , the faa revised saib hq-16-05 to include similar wording regarding the acceptability of using ul94 in aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with avgas that has a minimum motor octane rating of 80 or lower , including grade 80/87 , satisfactorily tested by the faa , tested by purdue university , and approved under astm specification d7719 for high-octane grade ul102 , allowing the company to test more economically in non-experimental aircraft under a federal court order to set a new standard by october 15 , 2008 , the epa cut the acceptable limits for atmospheric lead from the previous standard of 1.5 & nbsp ; µg/m 3 to 0.15 & nbsp ; µg/m 3 '' despite assertions in the media that leaded avgas will be eliminated in the us by 2017 at the latest date , the epa confirmed in july 2010 that there is no phase-out date and that setting one would be an faa responsibility as the epa has no authority over avgas avgas is occasionally used in auto racing cars as its octane rating is higher than automotive gasoline thus allowing the engines to run at higher compression ratios

the main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate , which is a mixture of various isooctanes nav canada , november 23 , 2006 avgas has an emission factor ( or factor ) of of carbon dioxide or about 3.07 units of weight produced per unit weight of fuel used ( unleaded avgas is also available ) because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive , the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used ; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum historically , many post-wwii developed , low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels ; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel has not yet been developed and certified for most of these engines some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels , but some do not , and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used lycoming provides a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with them however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation the use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear due to the lack of lead with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours from 1983 through 2008 , us usage of avgas declined consistently by approximately each year however , prices are so high that there have been efforts to convert to diesel fuel , which is more readily available , less expensive , and has advantages for aviation use the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure for example , 100/130 avgas has an octane rating of 100 at the lean settings usually used for cruising and 130 at the rich settings used for take-off and other full-power conditions the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives in july 2014 , nine companies and consortiums submitted proposals to the piston aviation fuels initiative ( pafi ) to assess fuels without tetraethyl lead unleaded 94 motor octane fuel ( ul94 ) is essentially 100ll without the lead this 94ul meets the avgas specification including vapor pressure but has not been completely tested for detonation qualities in all continental engines or under all conditions the lycoming position is supported by aircraft type clubs representing owners of aircraft that would be unable to run on lower octane fuel ul94 meets all of the same specification property limits as 100ll with the exception of a lower motor octane number ( 94.0 minimum for ul94 vs ul94 is not intended to be a full replacement for 100ll but rather is designed to be a drop-in replacement for aircraft with lower-octane-rated engines , such as those that are approved for operation on grade 80 avgas ( or lower ) , ul91 , or mogas it is estimated that up to 65 % of the fleet of current general aviation piston-engine-powered aircraft can operate on ul94 with no modifications to either the engine or airframe aki is the octane rating used to grade all u.s the publication of the saib , especially the august 2016 revision , eliminated the need for many of the ul94 stcs being sold by swift fuels , as the majority of the aircraft on the stc 's approved model list are type-certified to use 80-octane or lower avgas on april 6 , 2017 , lycoming engines published service instruction 1070v , which adds ul94 as an approved grade of fuel for dozens of engine models , 60 % of which are carbureted engines following tests in two lycoming engines , the faa concluded it performs better than 100ll in detonation testing and will provide a fuel saving of 8 % per unit of volume , though it weighs more than 100ll in december 2013 shell oil announced that they had developed an unleaded 100 octane fuel and will submit it for faa testing with certification expected within two to three years fifteen of 17 airports monitored during a year-long study in the us by the epa have lead emissions well below the current national ambient air quality standard ( naaqs ) for lead

the main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate , which is a mixture of various isooctanes nav canada , november 23 , 2006 avgas has an emission factor ( or factor ) of of carbon dioxide or about 3.07 units of weight produced per unit weight of fuel used the upper limits are related to atmospheric pressure at sea level , 14.7 psi , for motor vehicles and ambient pressure at 22,000 ft , 6.25 psi , for aircraft the lower avgas volatility reduces the chance of vapor lock in fuel lines at altitudes up to 22,000 ft the high octane ratings were traditionally achieved by the addition of tetraethyllead , a highly toxic substance that was tetraethyllead phaseout and ban in the late 20th century ) because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive , the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used ; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum historically , many post-wwii developed , low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels ; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel has not yet been developed and certified for most of these engines some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels , but some do not , and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation the use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear due to the lack of lead with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours many grades of avgas are identified by two numbers associated with its motor octane number ( mon ) the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure phase-out of leaded aviation gasoline the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives in february 2008 , teledyne continental motors ( tcm ) announced that the company is very concerned about future availability of 100ll , and as a result , they would develop a line of diesel engines in a february 2008 interview , tcm president rhett ross indicated belief that the aviation industry will be '' forced out '' of using 100ll in the near future , leaving automotive fuel and jet fuel as the only alternatives in july 2014 , nine companies and consortiums submitted proposals to the piston aviation fuels initiative ( pafi ) to assess fuels without tetraethyl lead unleaded 94 motor octane fuel ( ul94 ) is essentially 100ll without the lead flight testing has been conducted in an io-550-b powering a beechcraft bonanza and ground testing in continental o-200 , 240 , o-470 , and o-520 engines in november 2015 , ul94 was added as a secondary grade of unleaded aviation gasoline to astm d7547 , which is the specification that governs ul91 unleaded avgas ul94 is an unleaded fuel , but as with all astm international unleaded gasoline specifications , a de minimis amount of unintentionally added lead is permitted ul94 is not intended to be a full replacement for 100ll but rather is designed to be a drop-in replacement for aircraft with lower-octane-rated engines , such as those that are approved for operation on grade 80 avgas ( or lower ) , ul91 , or mogas aki is the octane rating used to grade all u.s on april 6 , 2017 , lycoming engines published service instruction 1070v , which adds ul94 as an approved grade of fuel for dozens of engine models , 60 % of which are carbureted engines soon afterward , avweb reported that continental had begun the process of certifying several of its engines to use the new fuel '' despite assertions in the media that leaded avgas will be eliminated in the us by 2017 at the latest date , the epa confirmed in july 2010 that there is no phase-out date and that setting one would be an faa responsibility as the epa has no authority over avgas avgas is occasionally used in auto racing cars as its octane rating is higher than automotive gasoline thus allowing the engines to run at higher compression ratios

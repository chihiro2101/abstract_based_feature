the main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate , which is a mixture of various isooctanes gal is commonly used in america for weight and balance computation nav canada , november 23 , 2006 avgas has an emission factor ( or factor ) of of carbon dioxide or about 3.07 units of weight produced per unit weight of fuel used the high octane ratings were traditionally achieved by the addition of tetraethyllead , a highly toxic substance that was tetraethyllead phaseout and ban in the late 20th century ) because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive , the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used ; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum historically , many post-wwii developed , low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels ; a suitable unleaded replacement fuel has not yet been developed and certified for most of these engines some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels , but some do not , and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used lycoming provides a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with them however , all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used : '' when using the unleaded fuels identified in table 1 , lycoming oil additive p/n lw-16702 , or an equivalent finished product such as aeroshell 15w-50 , must be used '' lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification , otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation in such fuels , the lead acts as a lubricant , coating the contact areas between the valve , guide , and seat however , prices are so high that there have been efforts to convert to diesel fuel , which is more readily available , less expensive , and has advantages for aviation use many grades of avgas are identified by two numbers associated with its motor octane number ( mon ) the first number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to '' aviation lean '' standards , which is similar to the anti-knock index or '' pump rating '' given to automotive gasoline in the us the second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the '' aviation rich '' standard , which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture , elevated temperatures , and a high manifold pressure the 100ll phase-out has been called '' one of modern ga 's most pressing problems '' , because 70 % of 100ll aviation fuel is used by the 30 % of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that can not use any of the existing alternatives in february 2008 , teledyne continental motors ( tcm ) announced that the company is very concerned about future availability of 100ll , and as a result , they would develop a line of diesel engines in a february 2008 interview , tcm president rhett ross indicated belief that the aviation industry will be '' forced out '' of using 100ll in the near future , leaving automotive fuel and jet fuel as the only alternatives by may 2012 , the us federal aviation administration ( faa unleaded avgas transition rulemaking committee ) had put together a plan in conjunction with industry to replace leaded avgas with an unleaded alternative within 11 years in july 2014 , nine companies and consortiums submitted proposals to the piston aviation fuels initiative ( pafi ) to assess fuels without tetraethyl lead this 94ul meets the avgas specification including vapor pressure but has not been completely tested for detonation qualities in all continental engines or under all conditions flight testing has been conducted in an io-550-b powering a beechcraft bonanza and ground testing in continental o-200 , 240 , o-470 , and o-520 engines the faa found swift fuel to have a motor octane number of 104.4 , 96.3 % of the energy per unit of mass , and 113 % of the energy per unit of volume as 100ll , and to meet most of the astm d910 standard for leaded aviation fuel following tests in two lycoming engines , the faa concluded it performs better than 100ll in detonation testing and will provide a fuel saving of 8 % per unit of volume , though it weighs more than 100ll in december 2013 shell oil announced that they had developed an unleaded 100 octane fuel and will submit it for faa testing with certification expected within two to three years tel found in leaded avgas and its combustion products are potent neurotoxins that have been shown in scientific research to interfere with brain development in children '' despite assertions in the media that leaded avgas will be eliminated in the us by 2017 at the latest date , the epa confirmed in july 2010 that there is no phase-out date and that setting one would be an faa responsibility as the epa has no authority over avgas avgas is occasionally used in auto racing cars as its octane rating is higher than automotive gasoline thus allowing the engines to run at higher compression ratios

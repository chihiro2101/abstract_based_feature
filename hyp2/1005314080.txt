the procedure itself consists of the initialization step , the iteration step , and the project control list the iteration involves the redesign and implementation of iteration is to be simple , straightforward , and modular , supporting redesign at that stage or as a task added to the project control list in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used the project control list is modified in light of the analysis results incremental development slices the system functionality into increments ( portions ) inception identifies project scope , requirements ( functional and non-functional ) and risks at a high level but in enough detail that work can be estimated many examples of early usage are provided in craig larman and victor basili 's article '' iterative and incremental development : a brief history '' , iterative and incremental development : a brief history , craig larman and victor basili , ieee computer , june 2003 with one of the earliest being nasa 's 1960s project mercury their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program ’ s requirements changed during the software development process … in this approach , the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks , with increasing increments of capability.software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development variability : the software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed , for user acceptance testing time limitation : an operational product is delivered after months while in the incremental model the product is given to the user within a few weeks project size : waterfall model is unsuitable for small projects while the incremental model is suitable for small , as well as large projects while the term iterative and incremental development got started in the software industry , many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques

, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added the procedure itself consists of the initialization step , the iteration step , and the project control list it should offer a sampling of the key aspects of the problem and provide a solution that is simple enough to understand and implement easily to guide the iteration process , a project control list is created that contains a record of all tasks that need to be performed the iteration involves the redesign and implementation of iteration is to be simple , straightforward , and modular , supporting redesign at that stage or as a task added to the project control list in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used the analysis of an iteration is based upon user feedback , and the program analysis facilities available the project control list is modified in light of the analysis results incremental development slices the system functionality into increments ( portions ) their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program â€™ s requirements changed during the software development process the dod instruction 5000.2 released in 2000 stated a clear preference for iid : there are two approaches , evolutionary and single step waterfall , to full capability guidelines that drive software implementation and analysis include : any difficulty in design , coding and testing a modification should signal the need for redesign or re-coding while the term iterative and incremental development got started in the software industry , many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques

the procedure itself consists of the initialization step , the iteration step , and the project control list it should offer a sampling of the key aspects of the problem and provide a solution that is simple enough to understand and implement easily to guide the iteration process , a project control list is created that contains a record of all tasks that need to be performed the level of design detail is not dictated by the iterative approach in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used incremental development slices the system functionality into increments ( portions ) construction incrementally fills-in the architecture with production-ready code produced from analysis , design , implementation , and testing of the functional requirements each of the phases may be divided into 1 or more iterations , which are usually time-boxed rather than feature-boxed their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program â€™ s requirements changed during the software development process '' some organizations , such as the us department of defense , have a preference for iterative methodologies , starting with mil-std-498 '' clearly encouraging evolutionary acquisition and iid '' the main cause of the software development projects failure is the choice of the model , so should be made with a great care variability : the software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed , for user acceptance testing while the term iterative and incremental development got started in the software industry , many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques

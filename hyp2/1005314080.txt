the procedure itself consists of the initialization step , the iteration step , and the project control list to guide the iteration process , a project control list is created that contains a record of all tasks that need to be performed the iteration involves the redesign and implementation of iteration is to be simple , straightforward , and modular , supporting redesign at that stage or as a task added to the project control list in a light-weight iterative project the code may represent the major source of documentation of the system ; however , in a critical iterative project a formal software design document may be used incremental development slices the system functionality into increments ( portions ) their motivation for avoiding the waterfall life cycle was that the shuttle program ’ s requirements changed during the software development process '' some organizations , such as the us department of defense , have a preference for iterative methodologies , starting with mil-std-498 '' clearly encouraging evolutionary acquisition and iid '' … in this approach , the ultimate capability delivered to the user is divided into two or more blocks , with increasing increments of capability.software development shall follow an iterative spiral development process in which continually expanding software versions are based on learning from earlier development the main cause of the software development projects failure is the choice of the model , so should be made with a great care for example , the waterfall development paradigm completes the project-wide work-products of each discipline in one step before moving on to the next discipline in a succeeding step variability : the software is delivered to the user only after the build stage of the life cycle is completed , for user acceptance testing while the term iterative and incremental development got started in the software industry , many hardware and embedded software development efforts are using iterative and incremental techniques adaptive management continuous integration dynamic systems development method goal-driven software development process interaction design kaizen microsoft solutions framework object-oriented analysis and design openup/basic pdca rapid application development release early , release often

on june 27 , 1839 , la amistad ( '' friendship '' ) , a spanish vessel , departed from the port of havana , cuba ( then a spanish colony ) , for the camagüey province , also in cuba the masters of la amistad were the ship 's captain ramón ferrer , josé ruiz , and pedro montes , all spanish nationals montez held four additional africans , also entrusted to him by the governor-general on july 2 , 1839 , one of the africans , cinqué , freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who , like them , had been on the tecora ( the portugal ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from west africa to cuba ) the mende killed the ship 's cook , celestino , who had told them that they were to be killed and eaten by their captors the mende also killed captain ferrer ; the armed struggle resulted as well in the deaths of two africans two sailors escaped in a lifeboat the mende spared the lives of the two spaniards who could navigate the ship , josé ruiz and pedro montez , upon the condition that they would return the ship east back across the atlantic ocean to africa they also spared antonio , a creole , james covey deposition to the court and used him as an interpreter with ruiz and montez ( documenting the american south , university of north carolina ) the crew deceived the africans and steered la amistad north along the east coast of the united states , where the ship was sighted repeatedly some of the africans went ashore to procure water and provisions from the hamlet of montauk gedney , commanding the usrcs cutter ( ship ) , saw some of the africans on shore and , assisted by his officers and crew , took custody of la amistad and the africans gedney allegedly chose to land in connecticut because slavery was still technically legal there , under the state 's gradual abolition law , unlike in nearby new york state 15 gedney transferred the captured africans into the custody of the united states district court for the district of connecticut , at which time legal proceedings began 588–589 antonio vega , vice-consul of spain , libelled for '' the slave antonio , '' on the grounds that this man was his personal property josé antonio tellincas , with aspe and laca , claimed other goods on board la amistad he made a deposition '' that some twenty-five thousand slaves were brought into cuba every year – with the wrongful compliance of , and personal profit by , spanish officials secretary of state john forsyth on behalf '' of her majesty 's government constitution , the president could not influence the court case he said that the question of whether the '' negroes of the amistad '' had been enslaved in violation of the treaty was still an open one , '' and this government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns he suggested that if the court found for spanish rights of property , the africans would be returned to cuba at that point , great britain and spain could argue their questions of law and treaties between them secretary of state forsyth requested from the spanish minister , chevalier de argaiz , '' a copy of the laws now in force in the island of cuba relative to slavery the minister also expressed dismay that the africans had not already been returned to spanish control the spanish maintained that none but a spanish court could have jurisdiction over the case '' the minister noted that the spanish had recently turned over american sailors '' belonging to the crew of the american vessel 'william engs ' '' , whom it had tried by request of their captain and the american consul '' the spaniards asked how , if america had demanded that these sailors in an american ship be turned over to them despite being in a spanish port , they could now try the spanish mutineers the spaniards held that just as america had ended its importation of african slaves but maintained a legal domestic population , so too had cuba calhoun and the senate 's committee of foreign relations on april 15 , 1840 issued a statement announcing complete '' conformity between the views entertained by the senate , and the arguments urged by the spanish minister chevalier de argaiz '' concerning la amistad they went on to point out that the minister had stated that a payment to compensate the owners '' would be a slender compensation ; for though the property should remain , as it ought to remain , unimpaired , public vengeance would be frustrated '' john quincy adams later argued this issue before the supreme court in 1841 , saying , the africans were in possession , and had the presumptive right of ownership ; they were in peace with the united states : the ship was theirs , and being in immediate communication with the shore , was in the territory of the state of new york ; or , if not , at least half the number were actually on the soil of new york , and entitled to all the provisions of the law of nations , and the protection and comfort which the laws of that state secure to every human being within its limits a case before the circuit court in hartford , connecticut , was filed in september 1839 , charging the africans with mutiny and murder on la amistad the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction , because the alleged acts took place on a spanish ship in spanish waters article 9 of this treaty holds that '' all ships and merchandises of what nature soever , which shall be rescued out of the hands of pirates or robbers on the high seas , he went to the docks of new york city , and counted aloud in front of sailors until he located a person able to understand and translate covey was a former slave from west africa 590 the abolitionists ' main argument before the district court was that a treaty between britain and spain of 1817 and a subsequent pronouncement by the spanish government had outlawed the slave trade across the atlantic they established that the slaves had been captured in mendiland ( also spelled mendeland , current sierra leone ) in africa , sold to a portuguese trader in lomboko ( south of freetown ) in april 1839 , and taken to havana illegally on a portuguese ship in january 1840 , it ordered that the africans be returned to their homeland by the u.s attorney appealed the federal government 's case to the united states supreme court howard jones ' published mutiny on the amistad : the saga of a slave revolt and its impact on american abolition , law , and diplomacy in 1987 african-american artist hale woodruff painted murals portraying events related to the revolt on the amistad in 1938 , for talladega college in alabama amistad research center , tulane university american slave court cases john quincy adams and abolitionism

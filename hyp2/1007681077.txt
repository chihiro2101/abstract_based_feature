on june 27 , 1839 , la amistad ( '' friendship '' ) , a spanish vessel , departed from the port of havana , cuba ( then a spanish colony ) , for the camagüey province , also in cuba the masters of la amistad were the ship 's captain ramón ferrer , josé ruiz , and pedro montes , all spanish nationals ruiz was transporting 49 africans , entrusted to him by the governor-general of cuba montez held four additional africans , also entrusted to him by the governor-general on july 2 , 1839 , one of the africans , cinqué , freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who , like them , had been on the tecora ( the portugal ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from west africa to cuba ) the mende also killed captain ferrer ; the armed struggle resulted as well in the deaths of two africans the mende spared the lives of the two spaniards who could navigate the ship , josé ruiz and pedro montez , upon the condition that they would return the ship east back across the atlantic ocean to africa they also spared antonio , a creole , james covey deposition to the court and used him as an interpreter with ruiz and montez ( documenting the american south , university of north carolina ) the crew deceived the africans and steered la amistad north along the east coast of the united states , where the ship was sighted repeatedly gedney , commanding the usrcs cutter ( ship ) , saw some of the africans on shore and , assisted by his officers and crew , took custody of la amistad and the africans taking them to the long island sound port of new london , connecticut , he presented officials with a written claim for his property rights under international admiralty law for salvage of the vessel , the cargo , and the africans gedney allegedly chose to land in connecticut because slavery was still technically legal there , under the state 's gradual abolition law , unlike in nearby new york state 15 gedney transferred the captured africans into the custody of the united states district court for the district of connecticut , at which time legal proceedings began gedney filed a libel ( a lawsuit in admiralty law ) for salvage rights to the african captives and cargo on board la amistad as property seized on the high seas henry green and pelatiah fordham filed a libel for salvage , claiming that they had been the first to discover la amistad josé ruiz and pedro montes filed libels requesting that their property of '' slaves '' and cargo be returned to them the united states district court for the district of connecticut , representing the spanish government , libelled that the '' slaves '' , cargo , and vessel be returned to spain as its property 588–589 antonio vega , vice-consul of spain , libelled for '' the slave antonio , '' on the grounds that this man was his personal property 589 the africans denied that they were slaves or property , and argued that the court could not '' return '' them to the control of the government of spain as the british had entered into a treaty with spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator , they considered it a matter of international law that the united states release the africans '' madden also '' told the court that his examinations revealed that the defendants were brought directly from africa and could not have been residents of cuba , '' as the spanish had claimed madden ( who later had an audience with queen victoria concerning the case ) conferred with the british minister in washington , d.c at that point , great britain and spain could argue their questions of law and treaties between them secretary of state forsyth requested from the spanish minister , chevalier de argaiz , '' a copy of the laws now in force in the island of cuba relative to slavery the spanish minister stated '' i do not , in fact , understand how a foreign court of justice can be considered competent to take cognizance of an offence committed on board of a spanish vessel , by spanish subjects , and against spanish subjects , in the waters of a spanish territory ; for it was committed on the coasts of this island , and under the flag of this nation '' the minister noted that the spanish had recently turned over american sailors '' belonging to the crew of the american vessel 'william engs ' '' , whom it had tried by request of their captain and the american consul '' other american sailors had protested this and when the american ambassador raised the issue with the spaniards , on march 20 , 1839 '' her majesty , having taken into consideration all the circumstances , decided that the said seamen should be placed at the disposition of the american consul , seeing that the offence was committed in one of the vessels and under the flag of his nation , and not on shore '' the spaniards asked how , if america had demanded that these sailors in an american ship be turned over to them despite being in a spanish port , they could now try the spanish mutineers '' the spaniards pointed out that by american law the jurisdiction over a vessel on the high seas , in time of peace , engaged in a lawful voyage , is , according to the laws of nations , under the exclusive jurisdiction of the state to which her flag belongs ; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain calhoun and the senate 's committee of foreign relations on april 15 , 1840 issued a statement announcing complete '' conformity between the views entertained by the senate , and the arguments urged by the spanish minister chevalier de argaiz '' concerning la amistad they protested when judge william jay construed a statement by their minister as seeming to demand '' the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner amistad , as murderers , and not as property ; that is to say founding his demand on the law of nations , and not on the treaty of 1795 '' the case was already in the federal district court the spanish also sought to avoid talk about the law of nations , as some of their opponents argued that america had a duty under the law of nations to treat the africans with the same deference they would accord any other foreign sailors john quincy adams later argued this issue before the supreme court in 1841 , saying , the africans were in possession , and had the presumptive right of ownership ; they were in peace with the united states : when pressed with questions concerning the law of nations , the spanish referred to a concept of hugo grotius ( credited as one of the originators of the law of nations ) a case before the circuit court in hartford , connecticut , was filed in september 1839 , charging the africans with mutiny and murder on la amistad the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction , because the alleged acts took place on a spanish ship in spanish waters various parties filed property claims with the district court to many of the african captives , to the ship , and to its cargo : ruiz and montez , lieutenant gedney , and captain henry green ( who had met the africans while on shore on long island and claimed to have helped in their capture ) article 9 of this treaty holds that '' all ships and merchandises of what nature soever , which shall be rescued out of the hands of pirates or robbers on the high seas , the abolitionist movement had formed the '' amistad committee '' , headed by new york city merchant lewis tappan , and had collected money to mount a defense of the africans '' the spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire ( so that they could leave jail and return to cuba ) caused them a grave financial burden , and '' by the treaty of 1795 , no obstacle or impediment to leave the u.s baldwin , a prominent attorney , contended that the spanish government was trying to manipulate the court to return '' fugitives '' the historical society of farmington , connecticut offers walking tours of village houses that housed the africans while funds were collected for their return home amistad research center , tulane university american slave court cases john quincy adams and abolitionism

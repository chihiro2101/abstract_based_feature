on june 27 , 1839 , la amistad ( '' friendship '' ) , a spanish vessel , departed from the port of havana , cuba ( then a spanish colony ) , for the camagüey province , also in cuba the masters of la amistad were the ship 's captain ramón ferrer , josé ruiz , and pedro montes , all spanish nationals montez held four additional africans , also entrusted to him by the governor-general on july 2 , 1839 , one of the africans , cinqué , freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who , like them , had been on the tecora ( the portugal ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from west africa to cuba ) the mende also killed captain ferrer ; the armed struggle resulted as well in the deaths of two africans the mende spared the lives of the two spaniards who could navigate the ship , josé ruiz and pedro montez , upon the condition that they would return the ship east back across the atlantic ocean to africa they also spared antonio , a creole , james covey deposition to the court and used him as an interpreter with ruiz and montez ( documenting the american south , university of north carolina ) the crew deceived the africans and steered la amistad north along the east coast of the united states , where the ship was sighted repeatedly they dropped anchor half a mile off eastern long island , new york , on august 26 , 1839 , at culloden point some of the africans went ashore to procure water and provisions from the hamlet of montauk gedney , commanding the usrcs cutter ( ship ) , saw some of the africans on shore and , assisted by his officers and crew , took custody of la amistad and the africans taking them to the long island sound port of new london , connecticut , he presented officials with a written claim for his property rights under international admiralty law for salvage of the vessel , the cargo , and the africans gedney allegedly chose to land in connecticut because slavery was still technically legal there , under the state 's gradual abolition law , unlike in nearby new york state 15 gedney transferred the captured africans into the custody of the united states district court for the district of connecticut , at which time legal proceedings began gedney filed a libel ( a lawsuit in admiralty law ) for salvage rights to the african captives and cargo on board la amistad as property seized on the high seas henry green and pelatiah fordham filed a libel for salvage , claiming that they had been the first to discover la amistad josé ruiz and pedro montes filed libels requesting that their property of '' slaves '' and cargo be returned to them the united states district court for the district of connecticut , representing the spanish government , libelled that the '' slaves '' , cargo , and vessel be returned to spain as its property 588–589 antonio vega , vice-consul of spain , libelled for '' the slave antonio , '' on the grounds that this man was his personal property as the british had entered into a treaty with spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator , they considered it a matter of international law that the united states release the africans madden ( who later had an audience with queen victoria concerning the case ) conferred with the british minister in washington , d.c he said that the question of whether the '' negroes of the amistad '' had been enslaved in violation of the treaty was still an open one , '' and this government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns he suggested that if the court found for spanish rights of property , the africans would be returned to cuba secretary of state forsyth requested from the spanish minister , chevalier de argaiz , '' a copy of the laws now in force in the island of cuba relative to slavery it was up to spanish courts to determine '' whether the negroes in question '' were legal or illegal slaves under spanish law , '' but never can this right justly belong to a foreign country '' the spaniards pointed out that by american law the jurisdiction over a vessel on the high seas , in time of peace , engaged in a lawful voyage , is , according to the laws of nations , under the exclusive jurisdiction of the state to which her flag belongs ; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain '' the spanish pointed out that the statement jay was referring to was one where the spanish minister was '' speaking of the crime committed by the negroes slave revolt , and the punishment which they merit '' judge jay took issue with the spanish minister 's request that the africans be turned over to spanish authorities ( which seemed to imply that they were fugitives instead of misbehaving property ) , because the 1795 treaty said that property should be restored directly to the control of its owners constitution , which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of connecticut or new york , where the ship had been taken into custody , '' no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty , which is the supreme law of the country '' the case was already in the federal district court the spanish also sought to avoid talk about the law of nations , as some of their opponents argued that america had a duty under the law of nations to treat the africans with the same deference they would accord any other foreign sailors a case before the circuit court in hartford , connecticut , was filed in september 1839 , charging the africans with mutiny and murder on la amistad it was entered into the docket books of the federal court as united states v various parties filed property claims with the district court to many of the african captives , to the ship , and to its cargo : ruiz and montez , lieutenant gedney , and captain henry green ( who had met the africans while on shore on long island and claimed to have helped in their capture ) the spanish government asked that the ship , cargo and slaves be restored to spain under the pinckney treaty of 1795 between spain and the united states the abolitionist movement had formed the '' amistad committee '' , headed by new york city merchant lewis tappan , and had collected money to mount a defense of the africans initially , communication with the africans was difficult , since they spoke neither english nor spanish their arrest in new york city in october 1839 had outraged pro-slavery rights advocates and the spanish government '' the spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire ( so that they could leave jail and return to cuba ) caused them a grave financial burden , and '' by the treaty of 1795 , no obstacle or impediment to leave the u.s it ordered that the captives be delivered to the custody of the president of the united states for transportation to africa , since they were , in fact , legally free attorney appealed the federal government 's case to the united states supreme court 597 when la amistad anchored near long island , however , the court believed it to be in the possession of the africans on board , who had never intended to become slaves by international law of the seas , ships and property found helpless at sea were subject to claims ( salvage rights for property ) made by those who rescued them amistad research center , tulane university american slave court cases john quincy adams and abolitionism

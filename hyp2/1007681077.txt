the armed struggle resulted as well in the deaths of two africans ( documenting the american south , university of north carolina ) the crew deceived the africans and steered la amistad north along the east coast of the united states , where the ship was sighted repeatedly gedney , commanding the usrcs cutter ( ship ) , saw some of the africans on shore and , assisted by his officers and crew , took custody of la amistad and the africans gedney allegedly chose to land in connecticut because slavery was still technically legal there , under the state 's gradual abolition law , unlike in nearby new york state josé ruiz and pedro montes filed libels requesting that their property of '' slaves '' and cargo be returned to them the united states district court for the district of connecticut , representing the spanish government , libelled that the '' slaves '' , cargo , and vessel be returned to spain as its property 589 the africans denied that they were slaves or property , and argued that the court could not '' return '' them to the control of the government of spain as the british had entered into a treaty with spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator , they considered it a matter of international law that the united states release the africans while the legal battle continued , richard robert madden , '' who served on behalf of the british commission to suppress the african slave trade in havana , '' arrived to testify he made a deposition '' that some twenty-five thousand slaves were brought into cuba every year – with the wrongful compliance of , and personal profit by , spanish officials '' madden also '' told the court that his examinations revealed that the defendants were brought directly from africa and could not have been residents of cuba , '' as the spanish had claimed madden ( who later had an audience with queen victoria concerning the case ) conferred with the british minister in washington , d.c he said that the question of whether the '' negroes of the amistad '' had been enslaved in violation of the treaty was still an open one , '' and this government would with great reluctance erect itself into a tribunal to investigate such questions between two friendly sovereigns he suggested that if the court found for spanish rights of property , the africans would be returned to cuba secretary of state forsyth requested from the spanish minister , chevalier de argaiz , '' a copy of the laws now in force in the island of cuba relative to slavery the spanish maintained that none but a spanish court could have jurisdiction over the case the spanish minister stated '' i do not , in fact , understand how a foreign court of justice can be considered competent to take cognizance of an offence committed on board of a spanish vessel , by spanish subjects , and against spanish subjects , in the waters of a spanish territory ; for it was committed on the coasts of this island , and under the flag of this nation '' the minister noted that the spanish had recently turned over american sailors '' belonging to the crew of the american vessel 'william engs ' '' , whom it had tried by request of their captain and the american consul the sailors had been found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to '' four years ' confinement in a fortress '' the spaniards pointed out that by american law the jurisdiction over a vessel on the high seas , in time of peace , engaged in a lawful voyage , is , according to the laws of nations , under the exclusive jurisdiction of the state to which her flag belongs ; as much so as if constituting a part of its own domain '' the spanish were further encouraged that their view would win out when u.s they protested when judge william jay construed a statement by their minister as seeming to demand '' the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner amistad , as murderers , and not as property ; that is to say founding his demand on the law of nations , and not on the treaty of 1795 '' the spanish pointed out that the statement jay was referring to was one where the spanish minister was '' speaking of the crime committed by the negroes slave revolt , and the punishment which they merit '' constitution , which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of connecticut or new york , where the ship had been taken into custody , '' no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty , which is the supreme law of the country a case before the circuit court in hartford , connecticut , was filed in september 1839 , charging the africans with mutiny and murder on la amistad it was entered into the docket books of the federal court as united states v various parties filed property claims with the district court to many of the african captives , to the ship , and to its cargo : ruiz and montez , lieutenant gedney , and captain henry green ( who had met the africans while on shore on long island and claimed to have helped in their capture ) the abolitionist movement had formed the '' amistad committee '' , headed by new york city merchant lewis tappan , and had collected money to mount a defense of the africans he went to the docks of new york city , and counted aloud in front of sailors until he located a person able to understand and translate ruiz , '' more comfortable in a new england setting ( and entitled to many amenities not available to the africans ) , hoped to garner further public support by staying in jail outraged , the spanish minister cavallero pedro alcántara argaiz made '' caustic accusations against america 's judicial system and continued to condemn the abolitionist affront '' the spanish held that the bailbonds that the men had to acquire ( so that they could leave jail and return to cuba ) caused them a grave financial burden , and '' by the treaty of 1795 , no obstacle or impediment to leave the u.s he ordered the schooner uss grampus to new haven harbor to return the africans to cuba immediately after a favorable decision , before any appeals could be decided the slave ship , sterne , 1953 smithsonian sources say that he escaped to new york , smithsonian institution or to canada , with the help of an abolitionist group ) introducing copies of correspondence between the spanish government and the secretary of state , he criticized president martin van buren for his assumption of unconstitutional powers in the case : adams argued that neither pinckney 's treaty nor the adams–onís treaty were applicable to the case 597 when la amistad anchored near long island , however , the court believed it to be in the possession of the africans on board , who had never intended to become slaves several southern lawmakers introduced resolutions into the united states congress to appropriate money for such payment but failed to gain passage , although it was supported by presidents james k amistad research center , tulane university american slave court cases john quincy adams and abolitionism

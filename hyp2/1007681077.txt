on june 27 , 1839 , la amistad ( '' friendship '' ) , a spanish vessel , departed from the port of havana , cuba ( then a spanish colony ) , for the camagüey province , also in cuba 587–8 as the voyage normally took only four days , the crew had brought four days ' worth of rations , not anticipating the strong headwind that slowed the schooner on july 2 , 1839 , one of the africans , cinqué , freed himself and the other captives using a file that had been found and kept by a woman who , like them , had been on the tecora ( the portugal ship that had transported them illegally as slaves from west africa to cuba ) the mende spared the lives of the two spaniards who could navigate the ship , josé ruiz and pedro montez , upon the condition that they would return the ship east back across the atlantic ocean to africa they also spared antonio , a creole , james covey deposition to the court and used him as an interpreter with ruiz and montez gedney , commanding the usrcs cutter ( ship ) , saw some of the africans on shore and , assisted by his officers and crew , took custody of la amistad and the africans david brion davis , inhuman bondage : the rise and fall of slavery in the new world 15 gedney transferred the captured africans into the custody of the united states district court for the district of connecticut , at which time legal proceedings began henry green and pelatiah fordham filed a libel for salvage , claiming that they had been the first to discover la amistad the united states district court for the district of connecticut , representing the spanish government , libelled that the '' slaves '' , cargo , and vessel be returned to spain as its property 588–589 antonio vega , vice-consul of spain , libelled for '' the slave antonio , '' on the grounds that this man was his personal property the amistad , p 589 the africans denied that they were slaves or property , and argued that the court could not '' return '' them to the control of the government of spain josé antonio tellincas , with aspe and laca , claimed other goods on board la amistad as the british had entered into a treaty with spain prohibiting the slave trade south of the equator , they considered it a matter of international law that the united states release the africans they applied diplomatic pressure to achieve this , including invoking the treaty of ghent with the us , which jointly enforced their respective prohibitions against the international slave trade while the legal battle continued , richard robert madden , '' who served on behalf of the british commission to suppress the african slave trade in havana , '' arrived to testify he made a deposition '' that some twenty-five thousand slaves were brought into cuba every year – with the wrongful compliance of , and personal profit by , spanish officials '' madden also '' told the court that his examinations revealed that the defendants were brought directly from africa and could not have been residents of cuba , '' as the spanish had claimed secretary of state john forsyth on behalf '' of her majesty 's government he suggested that if the court found for spanish rights of property , the africans would be returned to cuba secretary of state forsyth requested from the spanish minister , chevalier de argaiz , '' a copy of the laws now in force in the island of cuba relative to slavery the sailors had been found guilty of mutiny and sentenced to '' four years ' confinement in a fortress '' the spaniards asked how , if america had demanded that these sailors in an american ship be turned over to them despite being in a spanish port , they could now try the spanish mutineers the spaniards held that just as america had ended its importation of african slaves but maintained a legal domestic population , so too had cuba it was up to spanish courts to determine '' whether the negroes in question '' were legal or illegal slaves under spanish law , '' but never can this right justly belong to a foreign country calhoun and the senate 's committee of foreign relations on april 15 , 1840 issued a statement announcing complete '' conformity between the views entertained by the senate , and the arguments urged by the spanish minister chevalier de argaiz '' concerning la amistad the spanish categorized the africans as property to have the case fall under pinckney 's treaty of 1795 they protested when judge william jay construed a statement by their minister as seeming to demand '' the surrender of the negroes apprehended on board the schooner amistad , as murderers , and not as property ; that is to say founding his demand on the law of nations , and not on the treaty of 1795 '' the spanish pointed out that the statement jay was referring to was one where the spanish minister was '' speaking of the crime committed by the negroes slave revolt , and the punishment which they merit '' they went on to point out that the minister had stated that a payment to compensate the owners '' would be a slender compensation ; for though the property should remain , as it ought to remain , unimpaired , public vengeance would be frustrated '' judge jay took issue with the spanish minister 's request that the africans be turned over to spanish authorities ( which seemed to imply that they were fugitives instead of misbehaving property ) , because the 1795 treaty said that property should be restored directly to the control of its owners constitution , which would put the clauses of the treaty above the state laws of connecticut or new york , where the ship had been taken into custody , '' no one who respects the laws of the country ought to oppose the execution of the treaty , which is the supreme law of the country john quincy adams later argued this issue before the supreme court in 1841 , saying , the africans were in possession , and had the presumptive right of ownership ; they were in peace with the united states : a case before the circuit court in hartford , connecticut , was filed in september 1839 , charging the africans with mutiny and murder on la amistad the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction , because the alleged acts took place on a spanish ship in spanish waters it was entered into the docket books of the federal court as united states v district court for the district of connecticut and presented their arguments 590 the abolitionists ' main argument before the district court was that a treaty between britain and spain of 1817 and a subsequent pronouncement by the spanish government had outlawed the slave trade across the atlantic they established that the slaves had been captured in mendiland ( also spelled mendeland , current sierra leone ) in africa , sold to a portuguese trader in lomboko ( south of freetown ) in april 1839 , and taken to havana illegally on a portuguese ship it ordered that the captives be delivered to the custody of the president of the united states for transportation to africa , since they were , in fact , legally free adams said that did not apply either , since the precedent was established prior to the prohibition of the foreign slave trade by the united states a movie , amistad ( 1997 ) , was based on the events of the revolt and court cases , and howard jones ' 1987 book mutiny on the amistad the amistad research center at tulane university in new orleans , louisiana , has numerous resources for research into slavery , abolition , and african americans

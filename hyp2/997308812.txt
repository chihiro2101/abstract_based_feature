consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region isotope analysis has widespread applicability in the natural sciences archaeological materials , such as bone , organic residues , hair , or sea shells , can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade carbon isotopes are analysed in archaeology to determine the source of carbon at the base of the foodchain carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine , freshwater , and terrestrial food sources carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet to obtain an accurate picture of palaeodiets , it is important to understand processes of diagenesis that may affect the original isotopic signal interpretation of lead isotope data is , however , often contentious and faces numerous instrumental and methodological challenges all biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms , of which two or more are stable the main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen and sulfur , but also include silicon , iron , and strontium . stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems stable isotopes have become a popular method for understanding aquatic ecosystems because they can help scientists in understanding source links and process information in marine food webs certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning muscle or protein fractions have become the most common animal tissue used to examine the isotopes because they represent the assimilated nutrients in their diet the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s while all three indicate information on trophic dynamics , it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned 3 isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results carbon isotopes aid us in determining the primary production source responsible for the energy flow in an ecosystem these include isotopes within dissolved inorganic carbon pools ( dic ) may vary with temperature and location and that growth rates of phytoplankton may affect their uptake of the isotopes Î´ 13 c has been used in determining migration of juvenile animals from sheltered inshore areas to offshore locations by examining the changes in their diets analysis of the ratio of 18 o to 16 o in the shells of the colorado delta clam was used to assess the historical extent of the estuary in the colorado river delta prior to construction of upstream dams the stable isotopic ratios of drinking water are a function of location , and the geology that the water percolates through isotope analysis can be used by forensic investigators to determine whether two or more samples of explosives are of a common origin in isotope hydrology , stable isotopes of water ( 2 h and 18 o ) are used to estimate the source , age , and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems

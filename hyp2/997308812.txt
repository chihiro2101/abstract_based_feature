isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of , for archaeological purposes , bones and teeth consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region the isotopic oxygen ratios , then , of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised breast milk production draws upon the body water of the mother , which has higher levels of 18 o due to the preferential loss of 16 o through sweat , urine , and expired water vapour carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine , freshwater , and terrestrial food sources carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet to obtain an accurate picture of palaeodiets , it is important to understand processes of diagenesis that may affect the original isotopic signal a wide range of archaeological materials such as metals , glass and lead-based pigments have been sourced using isotopic characterization the main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen and sulfur , but also include silicon , iron , and strontium . stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems stable isotopes have become a popular method for understanding aquatic ecosystems because they can help scientists in understanding source links and process information in marine food webs certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning the stable isotope compositions are expressed in terms of delta values ( δ ) in permil ( ‰ ) , i.e stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs muscle or protein fractions have become the most common animal tissue used to examine the isotopes because they represent the assimilated nutrients in their diet the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s while all three indicate information on trophic dynamics , it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned 3 isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results ) because δ 13 c indicates the original source of primary producers , the isotopes can also help us determine shifts in diets , both short term , long term or permanent these include isotopes within dissolved inorganic carbon pools ( dic ) may vary with temperature and location and that growth rates of phytoplankton may affect their uptake of the isotopes thus , organisms higher in the trophic pyramid have accumulated higher levels of 15 n ( and higher δ 15 n values ) relative to their prey and others before them in the food web isotope analysis can be used by forensic investigators to determine whether two or more samples of explosives are of a common origin stable isotopic analysis has also been used in the identification of drug trafficking routes stable isotopic analysis has also been used for tracing the geographical origin of food and timber

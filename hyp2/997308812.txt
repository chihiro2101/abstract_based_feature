isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of , for archaeological purposes , bones and teeth consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region teeth are not subject to continual remodelling and so their isotopic oxygen ratios remain constant from the time of formation the isotopic oxygen ratios , then , of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised where deciduous teeth are present , it is also possible to determine the age at which a child was weaned archaeological materials , such as bone , organic residues , hair , or sea shells , can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade examining the carbon 12/carbon 13 isotope ratio , it is possible to determine whether animals and humans ate predominantly c3 or c4 plants carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine , freshwater , and terrestrial food sources carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet the carbon in bone collagen is predominantly sourced from dietary protein , while the carbon found in bone mineral is sourced from all consumed dietary carbon , included carbohydrates , lipids , and protein characterization of artifacts involves determining the isotopic composition of possible source materials such as metal ore bodies and comparing these data to the isotopic composition of analyzed artifacts particularly in the bronze age mediterranean , lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns the main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen and sulfur , but also include silicon , iron , and strontium stable isotopes have become a popular method for understanding aquatic ecosystems because they can help scientists in understanding source links and process information in marine food webs certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning higher ( or less negative ) delta values indicate increases in a sample 's isotope of interest , relative to the standard , and lower ( or more negative ) values indicate decreases stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs the main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal 's stomach ( empty or not ) , the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s stable isotopic analysis has also been used for tracing the geographical origin of food and timber in isotope hydrology , stable isotopes of water ( 2 h and 18 o ) are used to estimate the source , age , and flow paths of water flowing through ecosystems the main effects that change the stable isotope composition of water are evaporation and condensation organisms such as foraminifera which combine oxygen dissolved in the surrounding water with carbon and calcium to build their shells therefore incorporate the temperature-dependent 18 o to 16 o ratio

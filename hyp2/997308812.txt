isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of , for archaeological purposes , bones and teeth consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region teeth are not subject to continual remodelling and so their isotopic oxygen ratios remain constant from the time of formation the isotopic oxygen ratios , then , of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised as such , isotopic analysis makes use of the more resistant phosphate groups , rather than the less abundant hydroxyl group or the more likely diagenetic carbonate groups present archaeological materials , such as bone , organic residues , hair , or sea shells , can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade examining the carbon 12/carbon 13 isotope ratio , it is possible to determine whether animals and humans ate predominantly c3 or c4 plants carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine , freshwater , and terrestrial food sources all biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms , of which two or more are stable the main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen and sulfur , but also include silicon , iron , and strontium . stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems certain isotopes can signify distinct primary producers forming the bases of food webs and trophic level positioning , 13 c ) and r represents the ratio of the isotope of interest and its natural form ( e.g stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s while all three indicate information on trophic dynamics , it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned 3 isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results ) because δ 13 c indicates the original source of primary producers , the isotopes can also help us determine shifts in diets , both short term , long term or permanent fry found that at the beginning of the study the shrimp had isotopic values of δ 13 c -11 to -14‰ and 6-8‰ for δ 15 n and δ 34 s hydrogen isotopes in plant tissue are correlated with local water values but vary based on fractionation during photosynthesis , transpiration , and other processes in the formation of cellulose the stable isotopic ratios of drinking water are a function of location , and the geology that the water percolates through these differences in isotopic ratio are then biologically 'set ' in our hair as it grows and it has therefore become possible to identify recent geographic histories by the analysis of hair strands stable isotopic analysis has also been used for tracing the geographical origin of food and timber variability in water isotopes is used to study sources of water to streams and rivers , evaporation rates , groundwater recharge , and other hydrological processes

isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of , for archaeological purposes , bones and teeth although the rate of turnover of isotopic oxygen in hydroxyapatite is not fully known , it is assumed to be similar to that of collagen ; approximately 10 years consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region the isotopic oxygen ratios , then , of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised while teeth are more resistant to chemical and physical changes over time , both are subject to post-depositional diagenesis as such , isotopic analysis makes use of the more resistant phosphate groups , rather than the less abundant hydroxyl group or the more likely diagenetic carbonate groups present archaeological materials , such as bone , organic residues , hair , or sea shells , can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade examining the carbon 12/carbon 13 isotope ratio , it is possible to determine whether animals and humans ate predominantly c3 or c4 plants to obtain an accurate picture of palaeodiets , it is important to understand processes of diagenesis that may affect the original isotopic signal characterization of artifacts involves determining the isotopic composition of possible source materials such as metal ore bodies and comparing these data to the isotopic composition of analyzed artifacts particularly in the bronze age mediterranean , lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns all biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms , of which two or more are stable for example , most carbon is present as 12 c , with approximately 1 % being 13 c the ratio of the two isotopes may be altered by biological and geophysical processes , and these differences can be utilized in a number of ways by ecologists . stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems stable isotopes have become a popular method for understanding aquatic ecosystems because they can help scientists in understanding source links and process information in marine food webs the stable isotope compositions are expressed in terms of delta values ( δ ) in permil ( ‰ ) , i.e stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs the main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal 's stomach ( empty or not ) , the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s carbon isotopes aid us in determining the primary production source responsible for the energy flow in an ecosystem hydrogen isotope ratios in animal tissue reflect diet , including drinking water , and have been used to study bird migration and aquatic food webs stable isotopic analysis has also been used in the identification of drug trafficking routes

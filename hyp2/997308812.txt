isotopic oxygen is incorporated into the body primarily through ingestion at which point it is used in the formation of , for archaeological purposes , bones and teeth consequently , should an individual remain in a region for 10 years or longer , the isotopic oxygen ratios in the bone hydroxyapatite would reflect the oxygen ratios present in that region teeth are not subject to continual remodelling and so their isotopic oxygen ratios remain constant from the time of formation the isotopic oxygen ratios , then , of teeth represent the ratios of the region in which the individual was born and raised as such , isotopic analysis makes use of the more resistant phosphate groups , rather than the less abundant hydroxyl group or the more likely diagenetic carbonate groups present archaeological materials , such as bone , organic residues , hair , or sea shells , can serve as substrates for isotopic analysis carbon , nitrogen and zinc isotope ratios are used to investigate the diets of past people ; these isotopic systems can be used with others , such as strontium or oxygen , to answer questions about population movements and cultural interactions , such as trade carbon isotope ratios can also be used to distinguish between marine , freshwater , and terrestrial food sources carbon isotope ratios can be measured in bone collagen or bone mineral ( hydroxylapatite ) , and each of these fractions of bone can be analysed to shed light on different components of diet characterization of artifacts involves determining the isotopic composition of possible source materials such as metal ore bodies and comparing these data to the isotopic composition of analyzed artifacts particularly in the bronze age mediterranean , lead isotope analysis has been a useful tool for determining the sources of metals and an important indicator of trade patterns interpretation of lead isotope data is , however , often contentious and faces numerous instrumental and methodological challenges problems such as the mixing and re-using of metals from different sources , limited reliable data and contamination of samples can be difficult problems in interpretation all biologically active elements exist in a number of different isotopic forms , of which two or more are stable the main elements used in isotope ecology are carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen and sulfur , but also include silicon , iron , and strontium . stable isotope analysis in aquatic ecosystems stable isotopes assist scientists in analyzing animal diets and food webs by examining the animal tissues that bear a fixed isotopic enrichment or depletion vs muscle or protein fractions have become the most common animal tissue used to examine the isotopes because they represent the assimilated nutrients in their diet the main advantage to using stable isotope analysis as opposed to stomach content observations is that no matter what the status is of the animal 's stomach ( empty or not ) , the isotope tracers in the tissues will give us an understanding of its trophic position and food source the three major isotopes used in aquatic ecosystem food web analysis are 13 c , 15 n and 34 s while all three indicate information on trophic dynamics , it is common to perform analysis on at least two of the previously mentioned 3 isotopes for better understanding of marine trophic interactions and for stronger results stable isotopic analysis has also been used in the identification of drug trafficking routes stable isotopic analysis has also been used for tracing the geographical origin of food and timber variability in water isotopes is used to study sources of water to streams and rivers , evaporation rates , groundwater recharge , and other hydrological processes

in vector-based graphics editing , each leaf node in a scene graph represents some atomic unit of the document , usually a shape such as an ellipse or bezier path although shapes themselves ( particularly paths ) can be decomposed further into nodes such as spline nodes , it is practical to think of the scene graph as composed of shapes rather than going to a lower level of representation internally , there may be no real structural difference between layers and groups at all , since they are both just nodes of a scene graph a visibility member , for example , would be a feature of a layer , but not necessarily of a group scene graphs are useful for modern games using 3d graphics and increasingly large worlds or levels in such applications , nodes in a scene graph ( generally ) represent entities or objects in the scene the scene graph may also describe the spatial , as well as the logical , relationship of the various entities : the knight moves through 3d space as the horse moves in these large applications , memory requirements are major considerations when designing a scene graph this means that only a single copy of the data is kept , which is then referenced by any 'knight ' nodes in the scene graph the simplest form of scene graph uses an array or linked list data structure , and displaying its shapes is simply a matter of linearly iterating the nodes one by one scene graph operations and dispatch applying an operation on a scene graph requires some way of dispatching an operation based on a node 's type for example , in a render operation , a transformation group node would accumulate its transformation by matrix multiplication , vector displacement , quaternions or euler angles one alternative is scene graph rebuilding , where the scene graph is rebuilt for each of the operations performed this , however , can be very slow , but produces a highly optimised scene graph if the node is a transformation node , it adds its own transformation to the current transformation matrix for example , in 2d cases , scene graphs typically render themselves by starting at the tree 's root node and then recursively draw the child nodes an effective way of combining space partitioning and scene graphs is by creating a scene leaf node that contains the spatial partitioning data the hoops 3d graphics system appears to have been the first commercial scene graph library provided by a single software vendor graph ( data structure ) graph theory space partitioning tree ( data structure )

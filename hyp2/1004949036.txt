in vector-based graphics editing , each leaf node in a scene graph represents some atomic unit of the document , usually a shape such as an ellipse or bezier path internally , there may be no real structural difference between layers and groups at all , since they are both just nodes of a scene graph scene graphs in games and 3d applications scene graphs are useful for modern games using 3d graphics and increasingly large worlds or levels in such applications , nodes in a scene graph ( generally ) represent entities or objects in the scene the scene graph would have a 'horse ' node with a 'knight ' node attached to it the scene graph may also describe the spatial , as well as the logical , relationship of the various entities : the knight moves through 3d space as the horse moves in these large applications , memory requirements are major considerations when designing a scene graph for this reason , many large scene graph systems use geometry instancing to reduce memory costs and increase speed for small scene graphs , this tends to suffice scene graph operations and dispatch applying an operation on a scene graph requires some way of dispatching an operation based on a node 's type but since the underlying implementation of the rendering api usually lacks portability , one might separate the scene graph and rendering systems instead at this point , many scene graph engines then traverse back up the tree , applying a similar operation bounding volume hierarchy ( bvhs ) are useful for numerous tasks – including efficient culling and speeding up collision detection between objects a scene graph can easily be adapted to include/become a bvh – if each node has a volume associated or there is a purpose-built '' bound node '' added in at convenient location in the hierarchy an effective way of combining space partitioning and scene graphs is by creating a scene leaf node that contains the spatial partitioning data depending on the particulars of the application 's drawing performance , a large part of the scene graph 's design can be impacted by rendering efficiency considerations it was followed up with open inventor in 1994 , another iteration of the high level scene graph built on top of newer releases of performer graph ( data structure ) graph theory space partitioning tree ( data structure )

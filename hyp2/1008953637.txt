lusatia comprises two both scenically and historically different parts : a hilly southern '' upper '' section and a '' lower '' region , which belongs to the north european plain upper lusatia ( oberlausitz or hornja łužica ) is today part of the german state of saxony , except for a small part east of the neisse river around lubań , which now belongs to the polish lower silesian voivodeship it consists of hilly countryside rising in the south to the lusatian highlands near the czech border , and then even higher to form the zittau hills , the small northern part of the lusatian mountains ( lužické hory/lausitzer gebirge ) in the czech republic upper lusatia is characterised by fertile soil and undulating hills as well as by historic towns and cities such as bautzen , görlitz , zittau , löbau , kamenz , lubań , bischofswerda , herrnhut , hoyerswerda , and bad muskau many villages in the very south of upper lusatia contain a typical attraction of the region , the so-called umgebindehäuser , half-timbered-houses representing a combination of franconian and slavic style between upper and lower lusatia is a region called the grenzwall , literally meaning '' border dyke '' , although it is in fact a morainic ridge the lusatian lake district ( german : lausitzer seenland , lower sorbian : łužyska jazorina , upper sorbian : łužiska jězorina ) will become europe 's largest artificial lake district as lusatia is not , and never has been , a single administrative unit , upper and lower lusatia have different , but in some respects similar , histories historically , the administrative centres of lower lusatia were at luckau and lübben , while the historical capital of upper lusatia is bautzen since 1945 , when a small part of lusatia east of the oder–neisse line was incorporated into poland , żary has been touted as the capital of polish lusatia until 963 the lusatian tribes were subdued by the saxon margrave gero and upon his death two years later , the march of lusatia was established on the territory of today 's lower lusatia and remained with the holy roman empire , while the adjacent northern march again got lost in the slavic uprising of 983 the later upper lusatian region of the milceni lands up to the silesian border at the kwisa river at first was part of the margraviate of meissen under margrave eckard i following the lutheran reformation , the greater part of lusatia became protestant except for the area between bautzen , kamenz and hoyerswerda according to the 1635 peace of prague , most of lusatia became a province of the electorate of saxony , except for the region around cottbus possessed by brandenburg the newly established kingdom of saxony , however , sided with napoleon ; therefore , at the 1815 congress of vienna , lusatia was divided , with lower lusatia and the northeastern part of upper lusatia around hoyerswerda , rothenburg , görlitz and lubań awarded to prussia only the southwestern part of upper lusatia , which included löbau , kamenz , bautzen and zittau , remained part of saxony after world war ii according to the potsdam agreement , lusatia was divided between allied-occupied germany ( soviet occupation zone ) and the republic of poland along the oder–neisse line the lusatian national committee in prague claimed the right to self-government and separation from germany and the creation of a lusatian free state or attachment to czechoslovakia in 1945 , the northeastern part of upper lusatia west of the neisse rejoined saxony and in 1952 , when the state was divided into three administrative areas ( bezirke ) , the upper lusatian region became part of the dresden administrative region the number of sorbs in lusatia has decreased since the 1900 census due to intermarriage , germanization , cultural assimilation related to industrialisation and urbanisation , nazi suppression and discrimination , ethnocide and the settlement of expelled germans after world war ii , mainly from lower silesia and northern bohemia

intestacy has a limited application in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or roman law because the concept of a will is itself less important ; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person 's next-of-kin title to a large part ( forced estate ) of the estate 's property by operation of law , beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift in matters of cross-border inheritance , the '' laws of succession '' is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate estates in common law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and sharia law jurisdictions their personal property could formerly be disposed of by a testament , hence the hallowed legal merism last will and testament these are known as forced heirship rights and are not typically found in common law jurisdictions , where the rules of succession without a will ( intestate succession ) play a back-up role where an individual has not ( or has not fully ) exercised his or her right to dispose of property in a will in most contemporary common-law jurisdictions , the law of intestacy is patterned after the common law of descent property goes first or in major part to a spouse , then to children and their descendants ; if there are no descendants , the line of inheritance goes back up the family tree to the parents , the siblings , the siblings ' descendants , the grandparents , the parents ' siblings , and the parents ' siblings ' descendants , and usually so on further to the more remote degrees of kinship for persons with no surviving children but surviving close relatives ( such as siblings or parents ) , the first £450,000 goes to the spouse or civil partner ( as from february 2009 ) for deaths after 1 october 2014 , the current rules where someone dies leaving a spouse or civil partner are as follows : if there are no children , grandchildren , or great-grandchildren then the spouse or civil partner inherits the entire estate if there are children , grandchildren , or great-grandchildren , the spouse receives the personal possessions and the first £270,000 , then half of everything else passing under the intestacy rules many states have adopted all or part of the uniform probate code , but often with local variations , in ohio , the law of intestate succession has been modified significantly from the common law , and has been essentially codified

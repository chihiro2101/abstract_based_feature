in the early years , from 1840 until 1850 , all stamps were issued imperforate , and had to be cut from the sheet with scissors or knife in 1847 , henry archer constructed the first ( rouletting ) machine , the '' archer roulette '' , to separate stamps this machine consisted of lancet-shaped blades working on a fly-press principle and piercing the paper with a series of cuts archer then abandoned this approach in favour of perforation , a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes the arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation , and this became known as '' comb '' perforation perforation trials were conducted in 1849 and 1850 under the auspices of the british government and stamps from these trials were first issued towards the end of 1850 as such , it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by george c the key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes ; if too far apart , the stamps will not separate easily , and the stamps are likely to tear , but if too close , the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling the standard for describing perforation is the number of holes ( or the '' teeth '' or perfs of an individual stamp ) in a 2-centimeter span the finest gauge ever used is 18 on stamps of the malay states in the early 1950s , and the coarsest is 2 , seen on the 1891 stamps of bhopal the first self-adhesive stamp was issued by sierra leone in 1964 , and by the 1990s these stamps came into wide use from 2012 to 2016 the united states also sold small numbers of the stamps issued during this period in sheets without die cuts , thus creating imperforated varieties of them stamp perforations with particular emphasis on canadian stamps

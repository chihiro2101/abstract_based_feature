in the early years , from 1840 until 1850 , all stamps were issued imperforate , and had to be cut from the sheet with scissors or knife imperforate stamps have been issued occasionally since then , either because separation equipment was temporarily unavailable ( in newborn nations for instance ) , to makers of automatic stamp vending equipment ( the united states did this in the 1900s and 1910s ) , as novelties for stamp collecting ( particularly when stamps are issued in souvenir sheets ) , or as errors in 1847 , henry archer constructed the first ( rouletting ) machine , the '' archer roulette '' , to separate stamps archer then abandoned this approach in favour of perforation , a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes the arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation , and this became known as '' comb '' perforation new machines based on archer 's principles were constructed by david napier and son ltd ; these were initially used in october 1853 for revenue stamps and from january 1854 for postage stamps as such , it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by george c the key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes ; if too far apart , the stamps will not separate easily , and the stamps are likely to tear , but if too close , the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling in the case of certain stamps produced by australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets ( coil stamps ) a pattern can be seen on the stamp 's short side of two small , ten large and two small holes the finest gauge ever used is 18 on stamps of the malay states in the early 1950s , and the coarsest is 2 , seen on the 1891 stamps of bhopal these are inevitably diecut , meaning that the stamps themselves are cut entirely apart , held together only by the backing paper from 2012 to 2016 the united states also sold small numbers of the stamps issued during this period in sheets without die cuts , thus creating imperforated varieties of them although the collector could count the number of holes using a ruler , the usual practice is to use a perforation gauge , which has preprinted patterns of holes in a selection of common perforations , requiring one merely to line up the stamp 's perforations with the closest match

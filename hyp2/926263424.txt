in the early years , from 1840 until 1850 , all stamps were issued imperforate , and had to be cut from the sheet with scissors or knife in 1847 , henry archer constructed the first ( rouletting ) machine , the '' archer roulette '' , to separate stamps archer then abandoned this approach in favour of perforation , a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes the arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation , and this became known as '' comb '' perforation the archer machine proved the viability of the process but never entered service new machines based on archer 's principles were constructed by david napier and son ltd ; these were initially used in october 1853 for revenue stamps and from january 1854 for postage stamps as such , it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by george c in the case of certain stamps produced by australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets ( coil stamps ) a pattern can be seen on the stamp 's short side of two small , ten large and two small holes the standard for describing perforation is the number of holes ( or the '' teeth '' or perfs of an individual stamp ) in a 2-centimeter span the finest gauge ever used is 18 on stamps of the malay states in the early 1950s , and the coarsest is 2 , seen on the 1891 stamps of bhopal stamps that are perforated on one pair of opposite sides and imperforate on the other have most often been produced in coils instead of sheets , but they can sometimes come from booklet panes because self-adhesive stamps contain a sticky layer , it is far easier to roulette the separations , than to actually puch out the holes for perforations for the stamp collector , perforations matter , not only as a way to distinguish different stamps ( a perf 10 may be rarer and more valuable than a perf 11 of the same design ) , but also as part of the condition of stamps

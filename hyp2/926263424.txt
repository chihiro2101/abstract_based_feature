in the early years , from 1840 until 1850 , all stamps were issued imperforate , and had to be cut from the sheet with scissors or knife imperforate stamps have been issued occasionally since then , either because separation equipment was temporarily unavailable ( in newborn nations for instance ) , to makers of automatic stamp vending equipment ( the united states did this in the 1900s and 1910s ) , as novelties for stamp collecting ( particularly when stamps are issued in souvenir sheets ) , or as errors in 1847 , henry archer constructed the first ( rouletting ) machine , the '' archer roulette '' , to separate stamps the arrangement of the pins enabled the top and sides of each stamp across the row to be perforated in a single operation , and this became known as '' comb '' perforation new machines based on archer 's principles were constructed by david napier and son ltd ; these were initially used in october 1853 for revenue stamps and from january 1854 for postage stamps '' stamp perforation : the somerset house years 1848 to 1880 ( ray simpson and peter sargent ) '' the bemrose perforating machine '' , the london philatelist , february 2009 ( ray simpson ) both the stroke and rotary processes have been refined since then , but are basically still the ones in use in the 21st century the key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes ; if too far apart , the stamps will not separate easily , and the stamps are likely to tear , but if too close , the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling stamps that are perforated on one pair of opposite sides and imperforate on the other have most often been produced in coils instead of sheets , but they can sometimes come from booklet panes the first self-adhesive stamp was issued by sierra leone in 1964 , and by the 1990s these stamps came into wide use at first the backing paper was itself solid , but in a repeat of history , is now slightly rouletted so as to facilitate tearing off blocks of stamps without having to remove them from the backing it can be recognized by studying the edge of the stamp closely ; true perforations will have torn paper fibers on each tooth , while simulated perforations are smooth for the stamp collector , perforations matter , not only as a way to distinguish different stamps ( a perf 10 may be rarer and more valuable than a perf 11 of the same design ) , but also as part of the condition of stamps

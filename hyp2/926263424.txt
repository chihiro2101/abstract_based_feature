in the early years , from 1840 until 1850 , all stamps were issued imperforate , and had to be cut from the sheet with scissors or knife in 1847 , henry archer constructed the first ( rouletting ) machine , the '' archer roulette '' , to separate stamps archer then abandoned this approach in favour of perforation , a process which used rows of small round pins to punch out the holes perforation trials were conducted in 1849 and 1850 under the auspices of the british government and stamps from these trials were first issued towards the end of 1850 new machines based on archer 's principles were constructed by david napier and son ltd ; these were initially used in october 1853 for revenue stamps and from january 1854 for postage stamps '' stamp perforation : the somerset house years 1848 to 1880 ( ray simpson and peter sargent ) the key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes ; if too far apart , the stamps will not separate easily , and the stamps are likely to tear , but if too close , the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling the finest gauge ever used is 18 on stamps of the malay states in the early 1950s , and the coarsest is 2 , seen on the 1891 stamps of bhopal variations include syncopated perforations which are uneven , either skipping a hole or by making some holes larger rouletting uses small cuts in the paper instead of holes a few types of stamps have combined rouletting and perforation , for instance south africa in 1942 at first the backing paper was itself solid , but in a repeat of history , is now slightly rouletted so as to facilitate tearing off blocks of stamps without having to remove them from the backing stamp perforations with particular emphasis on canadian stamps

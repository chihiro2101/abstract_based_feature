δείκνυμι , henry george liddell , robert scott , a greek-english lexicon , on perseus digital library in rhetoric , the purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences it is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what ( and what not ) to spend their money on , but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals '' the original greek term παράδειγμα ( paradeigma ) was used in greek texts such as plato 's timaeus ( 28 ad ) as the model or the pattern that the demiurge used to create the cosmos the term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar : the 1900 merriam-webster dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or , in rhetoric , as a term for an illustrative parable or fable the merriam-webster online dictionary defines this usage as '' a philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school or discipline within which theories , laws , and generalizations and the experiments performed in support of them are formulated ; broadly : a philosophical or theoretical framework of any kind in his book , the structure of scientific revolutions ( first published in 1962 ) , kuhn defines a scientific paradigm as : '' universally recognized scientific achievements that , for a time , provide model problems and solutions for a community of practitioners , '' the structure of scientific revolution , kuhn , thomas s , what is to be observed and scrutinized the kind of questions that are supposed to be asked and probed for answers in relation to this subject how these questions are to be structured what predictions made by the primary theory within the discipline how the results of scientific investigations should be interpreted how an experiment is to be conducted , and what equipment is available to conduct the experiment in the structure of scientific revolutions , kuhn saw the sciences as going through alternating periods of normal science , when an existing model of reality dominates a protracted period of puzzle-solving , and revolution , when the model of reality itself undergoes sudden drastic change these preconceptions embody both hidden assumptions and elements that he describes as quasi-metaphysical ; kuhn , t s ( 1970 ) the structure of scientific revolutions kuhn , t s ( 1970 ) the structure of scientific revolutions kuhn was at pains to point out that the rationale for the choice of exemplars is a specific way of viewing reality : that view and the status of '' exemplar '' are mutually reinforcing the conviction that the current paradigm is reality tends to disqualify evidence that might undermine the paradigm itself ; this in turn leads to a build-up of unreconciled anomalies kuhn used the expression paradigm shift ( see below ) for this process , and likened it to the perceptual change that occurs when our interpretation of an ambiguous image '' flips over '' from one state to another an example of a currently accepted paradigm would be the standard model of physics the scientific method allows for orthodox scientific investigations into phenomena that might contradict or disprove the standard model ; however grant funding would be proportionately more difficult to obtain for such experiments , depending on the degree of deviation from the accepted standard model theory the experiment would test for to illustrate the point , an experiment to test for the mass of neutrinos or the decay of protons ( small departures from the model ) is more likely to receive money than experiments that look for the violation of the conservation of momentum , or ways to engineer reverse time travel mechanisms similar to the original kuhnian paradigm have been invoked in various disciplines other than the philosophy of science these include : the idea of major cultural themes , world view ( and see below ) , ideology , and mindsets five years later , albert einstein published his paper on special relativity , which challenged the set of rules laid down by classical mechanics , which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years kuhn 's original model is now generally seen as too limited some examples of contemporary paradigm shifts include : in medicine , the transition from '' clinical judgment '' to evidence-based medicine in social psychology , the transition from p-hacking to replication in software engineering , the transition from the rational paradigm to the empirical paradigm in artificial intelligence , the transition from classical ai to data-driven ai kuhn 's idea was , itself , revolutionary in its time it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science ; and , so , it may be that it caused ( or was part of ) a '' paradigm shift '' in the history and sociology of science however , kuhn would not recognize such a paradigm shift examples include rejection of aristarchus of samos , copernicus ' , and galileo 's theory of a heliocentric solar system , the discovery of electrostatic photography , xerography and the quartz clock kuhn pointed out that it could be difficult to assess whether a particular paradigm shift had actually led to progress , in the sense of explaining more facts , explaining more important facts , or providing better explanations , because the understanding of '' more important '' , '' better '' , etc one of the examples of incommensurability that kuhn used was the change in the style of chemical investigations that followed the work of lavoisier on atomic theory in the late 18th century however , many instances exist in which change in a discipline 's core model of reality has happened in a more evolutionary manner , with individual scientists exploring the usefulness of alternatives in a way that would not be possible if they were constrained by a paradigm this latter aspect of research programmes is inherited from kuhn 's work on paradigms , and represents an important departure from the elementary account of scientific method like kuhn , handa addressed the issue of changing paradigm ; the process popularly known as '' paradigm shift '' this broad shift in the social arena , in turn , changes the way the individual perceives reality 124 outlines some conditions that facilitate a system of thought to become an accepted dominant paradigm : professional organizations that give legitimacy to the paradigm dynamic leaders who introduce and purport the paradigm journals and editors who write about the system of thought harris stresses the primarily sociological importance of paradigms , pointing towards kuhn 's second edition of the structure of scientific revolutions

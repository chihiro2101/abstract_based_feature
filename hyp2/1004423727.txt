relevance logic was proposed in 1928 by russian soviet philosopher ivan e orlov ( 1886 – circa 1936 ) in his strictly mathematical paper '' the logic of compatibility of propositions '' published in matematicheskii sbornik the basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic , and some pioneering work was done by ackermann , moh , moh shaw-kwei , 1950 , '' , '' methodos 2 56–75 drawing on them , nuel belnap and alan ross anderson ( with others ) wrote the magnum opus of the subject , entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity in the 1970s ( the second volume being published in the nineties ) they focused on both systems of entailment and systems of relevance , where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary the early developments in relevance logic focused on the stronger systems the weakest of these logics is the relevance logic b for e , add axioms 1-7 , 10 , 11 , ( ( a\to a ) \land ( b\to b ) \to c ) \to c , and \box a\land \box b\to \box ( a\land b ) , where \box a is defined as ( a\to a ) \to a the standard model theory for relevance logics is the routley-meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by richard sylvan and robert meyer a routley–meyer frame f for a propositional language is a quadruple ( w , r , ,0 ) , where w is a non-empty set , r is a ternary relation on w , and is a function from w to w , and 0\in w some relevance logics can be given algebraic models , such as the logic r entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity , vol

relevance logic was proposed in 1928 by russian soviet philosopher ivan e orlov ( 1886 – circa 1936 ) in his strictly mathematical paper '' the logic of compatibility of propositions '' published in matematicheskii sbornik the basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic , and some pioneering work was done by ackermann , moh , moh shaw-kwei , 1950 , '' , '' methodos 2 56–75 drawing on them , nuel belnap and alan ross anderson ( with others ) wrote the magnum opus of the subject , entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity in the 1970s ( the second volume being published in the nineties ) the weakest of these logics is the relevance logic b for e , add axioms 1-7 , 10 , 11 , ( ( a\to a ) \land ( b\to b ) \to c ) \to c , and \box a\land \box b\to \box ( a\land b ) , where \box a is defined as ( a\to a ) \to a a routley–meyer frame f for a propositional language is a quadruple ( w , r , ,0 ) , where w is a non-empty set , r is a ternary relation on w , and is a function from w to w , and 0\in w a routley-meyer model m is a routley-meyer frame f together with a valuation , \vdash , that assigns a truth value to each atomic proposition relative to each point a\in w some relevance logics can be given algebraic models , such as the logic r entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity , vol stanford encyclopaedia of philosophy : '' relevance logic '' – by edwin mares '' relevance logic '' – by j

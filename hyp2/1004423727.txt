relevance logic was proposed in 1928 by russian soviet philosopher ivan e orlov ( 1886 – circa 1936 ) in his strictly mathematical paper '' the logic of compatibility of propositions '' published in matematicheskii sbornik the basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic , and some pioneering work was done by ackermann , moh , moh shaw-kwei , 1950 , '' , '' methodos 2 56–75 and church in kontroliertes denken : untersuchungen zum logikkalkül und zur logik der einzelwissenschaften , kommissions-verlag karl alber , edited by a drawing on them , nuel belnap and alan ross anderson ( with others ) wrote the magnum opus of the subject , entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity in the 1970s ( the second volume being published in the nineties ) they focused on both systems of entailment and systems of relevance , where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary the weakest of these logics is the relevance logic b for e , add axioms 1-7 , 10 , 11 , ( ( a\to a ) \land ( b\to b ) \to c ) \to c , and \box a\land \box b\to \box ( a\land b ) , where \box a is defined as ( a\to a ) \to a the standard model theory for relevance logics is the routley-meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by richard sylvan and robert meyer some relevance logics can be given algebraic models , such as the logic r katalin bimbó , relevance logics , in philosophy of logic , d '' relevance logic '' – by j

orlov ( 1886 – circa 1936 ) in his strictly mathematical paper '' the logic of compatibility of propositions '' published in matematicheskii sbornik the basic idea of relevant implication appears in medieval logic , and some pioneering work was done by ackermann , moh , moh shaw-kwei , 1950 , '' , '' methodos 2 56–75 and church in kontroliertes denken : untersuchungen zum logikkalkül und zur logik der einzelwissenschaften , kommissions-verlag karl alber , edited by a drawing on them , nuel belnap and alan ross anderson ( with others ) wrote the magnum opus of the subject , entailment : the logic of relevance and necessity in the 1970s ( the second volume being published in the nineties ) they focused on both systems of entailment and systems of relevance , where implications of the former kinds are supposed to be both relevant and necessary the early developments in relevance logic focused on the stronger systems a\to a a\land b\to a a\land b\to b ( a\to b ) \land ( a\to c ) \to ( a\to b\land c ) a\to a\lor b b\to a\lor b ( a\to c ) \land ( b\to c ) \to ( a\lor b\to c ) a\land ( b\lor c ) \to ( a\land b ) \lor ( a\land c ) \lnot\lnot a\to a the rules are the following a , a\to b\vdash b a , b\vdash a\land b a\to b\vdash ( c\to a ) \to ( c\to b ) a\to b\vdash ( b\to c ) \to ( a\to c ) a\to b\vdash \lnot b\to\lnot a stronger logics can be obtained by adding any of the following axioms for e , add axioms 1-7 , 10 , 11 , ( ( a\to a ) \land ( b\to b ) \to c ) \to c , and \box a\land \box b\to \box ( a\land b ) , where \box a is defined as ( a\to a ) \to a the standard model theory for relevance logics is the routley-meyer ternary-relational semantics developed by richard sylvan and robert meyer a routley–meyer frame f for a propositional language is a quadruple ( w , r , ,0 ) , where w is a non-empty set , r is a ternary relation on w , and is a function from w to w , and 0\in w ( d , \circ , e ) is an abelian monoid with identity e ; the monoid is lattice-ordered and satisfies x\circ ( y\lor z ) ( x\circ y ) \lor ( x\circ z ) ; x\leq x\circ x ; and if x\circ y\leq z , then x\circ\lnot z\leq \lnot y

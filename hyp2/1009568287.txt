the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors chapter 59 page 593 the nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark the lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast the axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes , the lateral group and the anterior group since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women , the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal there is a general consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait ( this is called a spandrel ) during breastfeeding , nipple stimulation by an infant will simulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple ‚Äù latching on refers to the baby fastening onto the nipple to breastfeeding a poor latch results in insufficient nipple stimulation to create the let down reflex the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant if the baby increases nursing time at the nipple , the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production if a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped , white and flattened , this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples nipple pain can also be caused by excessive friction of clothing against the nipple that causes a fissure and discharge in non-pregnant women or women who are not breastfeeding may not cause concern discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer cancers such as paget disease ( a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple ) can also cause nipple discharge nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody , comes from only one nipple , or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia , in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows discharge from the nipple can occur an infection in the breast or inflammatory breast cancer can cause this problem a nipple-sparing/subcutis mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed , but the nipple and areola are preserved some companies and non-profit organisations have used the word nipple or images of nipples to draw attention to their product or cause breast milk fleischer 's syndrome nipple prosthesis for breast cancer survivors nipple piercing supernumerary nipple udder

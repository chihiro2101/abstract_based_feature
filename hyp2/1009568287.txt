marsupials and eutheria typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally , from as few as two to as many as 19 the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors chapter 59 page 593 the nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark the lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast the axillary nodes are the apical axillary nodes , the lateral group and the anterior group the rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular , pectoral , or parasternal nodes since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women , the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal there is a general consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait ( this is called a spandrel ) during breastfeeding , nipple stimulation by an infant will simulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth when the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple , oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple a poor latch results in insufficient nipple stimulation to create the let down reflex after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many woman cease breastfeeding due to the pain one reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed any nipple discharge in a male usually is of more concern a very thin , hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple receiving an injection to prevent pain from the biopsy may be more painful than the biopsy itself some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia , in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows discharge from the nipple can occur skin puckering of the nipple - this can be caused by scar tissue from surgery or an infection other conditions of the nipple can mimic the signs and symptoms of breast cancer the culture tendency to hide the female nipple under clothing has existed in western culture since the 1800s breast milk fleischer 's syndrome nipple prosthesis for breast cancer survivors nipple piercing supernumerary nipple udder

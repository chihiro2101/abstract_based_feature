in mammals , a nipple ( also called mammary papilla or teat ) is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 15â€“20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip marsupials and eutheria typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally , from as few as two to as many as 19 the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors chapter 59 page 593 the nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark the lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast the rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular , pectoral , or parasternal nodes during breastfeeding , nipple stimulation by an infant will simulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth when the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple , oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple a good attachment is when the bottom of the areola ( the area around the nipple ) is in the baby 's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant if the baby increases nursing time at the nipple , the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production nipple pain can be a disincentive for breastfeeding nipple pain can also be caused by excessive friction of clothing against the nipple that causes a fissure nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast one nipple can have discharge while the other does not some cases of nipple discharge will clear on their own without treatment nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer cancers such as paget disease ( a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple ) can also cause nipple discharge nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody , comes from only one nipple , or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop a very thin , hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia , in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows retracted nipples - the nipple was raised above the surface but changes , begins to pull inward , and does not come out when stimulated other conditions of the nipple can mimic the signs and symptoms of breast cancer a nipple-sparing/subcutis mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed , but the nipple and areola are preserved nipples can be sensitive to touch , and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal breast milk fleischer 's syndrome nipple prosthesis for breast cancer survivors nipple piercing supernumerary nipple udder

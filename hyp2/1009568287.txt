in mammals , a nipple ( also called mammary papilla or teat ) is a small projection of skin containing the outlets for 15â€“20 lactiferous ducts arranged cylindrically around the tip marsupials and eutheria typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally , from as few as two to as many as 19 the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors the dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth intercostal nerve the lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast there is a general consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait ( this is called a spandrel ) the physiological purpose of nipples is to deliver milk to the infant , produced in the female mammary glands during lactation the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple a good attachment is when the bottom of the areola ( the area around the nipple ) is in the baby 's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth a poor latch results in insufficient nipple stimulation to create the let down reflex the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many woman cease breastfeeding due to the pain one reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple nipple pain can also be caused by excessive friction of clothing against the nipple that causes a fissure nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast discharge from the nipple does not occur in lactating women discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed the discharge can be clear , green , bloody , brown or straw-colored nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer cancers such as paget disease ( a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple ) can also cause nipple discharge nipple discharge that is not normal is bloody , comes from only one nipple , or comes out on its own without squeezing or touching the nipple nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed any nipple discharge in a male usually is of more concern a very thin , hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple some men develop a condition known as gynecomastia , in which the breast tissue under the nipple develops and grows scaly , flaking , itchy nipple - this is most often due to eczema or a bacterial or fungal infection an infection in the breast or inflammatory breast cancer can cause this problem herpes infection of the nipple can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful breast milk fleischer 's syndrome nipple prosthesis for breast cancer survivors nipple piercing supernumerary nipple udder

the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors chapter 59 page 593 the nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark the lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast the rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular , pectoral , or parasternal nodes why males have nipples has been the subject of scientific research there is a general consensus that the male nipple exists because there is no particular advantage to males losing the trait ( this is called a spandrel ) during breastfeeding , nipple stimulation by an infant will simulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus oxytocin is a hormone that increases during pregnancy and acts on the breast to help produce the milk-ejection reflex the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple ‚Äù latching on refers to the baby fastening onto the nipple to breastfeeding the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple this poor attachment can cause sore and cracked nipples and a reluctance of the mother to continue to breastfeed after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant one reason for the development of cracked and sore nipples is the incorrect latching-on of the infant to the nipple if a nipple appears to be wedge-shaped , white and flattened , this may indicates that the attachment of the infant is not good and there is a potential of developing cracked nipples nipple pain can also be caused by excessive friction of clothing against the nipple that causes a fissure nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast discharge from the nipple does not occur in lactating women discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed one nipple can have discharge while the other does not cancers such as paget disease ( a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple ) can also cause nipple discharge nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it comes out of both nipples or happens when the nipples are squeezed a very thin , hollow needle and slight suction will be used to remove a small sample from under the nipple retracted nipples - the nipple was raised above the surface but changes , begins to pull inward , and does not come out when stimulated herpes infection of the nipple can go unnoticed because the lesions are small but usually are quite painful a nipple-sparing/subcutis mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed , but the nipple and areola are preserved nipples can be sensitive to touch , and nipple stimulation can incite sexual arousal breast milk fleischer 's syndrome nipple prosthesis for breast cancer survivors nipple piercing supernumerary nipple udder

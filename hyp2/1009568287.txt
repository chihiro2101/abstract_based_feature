marsupials and eutheria typically have an even number of nipples arranged bilaterally , from as few as two to as many as 19 the skin of the nipple is rich in a supply of special nerves that are sensitive to certain stimuli : these are slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors the dominant nerve supply to the nipple comes from the lateral cutaneous branches of fourth intercostal nerve chapter 59 page 593 the nipple is also used as an anatomical landmark the lymphatic ducts that drain the nipple are the same for the breast the rest of the drainage leaves the nipple and breast through infroclavicular , pectoral , or parasternal nodes since nipples change throughout the life span in men and women , the anatomy of the nipple can change and this change may be expected and considered normal why males have nipples has been the subject of scientific research during breastfeeding , nipple stimulation by an infant will simulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus oxytocin release from the nipple stimulation of the infant causes the uterus to contract even after childbirth when the baby suckles or stimulates the nipple , oxytocin levels rise and small muscles in the breast contract and move the milk through the milk ducts the result of nipple stimulation by the newborn helps to move breast milk out through the ducts and to the nipple ‚Äù latching on refers to the baby fastening onto the nipple to breastfeeding a good attachment is when the bottom of the areola ( the area around the nipple ) is in the baby 's mouth and the nipple is drawn back inside his or her mouth the nipple is poorly stimulated when the baby latches on too close to the tip of the nipple after the birth of the infant , the milk supply increases based upon the continuous and increasing stimulation of the nipple by the infant if the baby increases nursing time at the nipple , the mammary glands respond to this stimulation by increasing milk production sore nipples that progress to cracked nipples is of concern since many woman cease breastfeeding due to the pain nipple discharge refers to any fluid that seeps out of the nipple of the breast discharge from the nipples of men or boys may indicate a problem discharge from the nipples can appear without squeezing or may only be noticeable if the nipples are squeezed some cases of nipple discharge will clear on their own without treatment nipple discharge is most often not cancer ( benign ) , but rarely , it can be a sign of breast cancer cancers such as paget disease ( a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple ) can also cause nipple discharge this change can be of concern since puckering or retraction of the nipple can indicate an underlying change in breast tissue that can be cancerous retracted nipples - the nipple was raised above the surface but changes , begins to pull inward , and does not come out when stimulated a nipple-sparing/subcutis mastectomy is a surgical procedure where breast tissue is removed , but the nipple and areola are preserved some companies and non-profit organisations have used the word nipple or images of nipples to draw attention to their product or cause breast milk fleischer 's syndrome nipple prosthesis for breast cancer survivors nipple piercing supernumerary nipple udder

when writing about controversies in the lead section of a biography , relevant material should neither be suppressed nor allowed to overwhelm : always pay scrupulous attention to reliable sources , and make sure the lead correctly reflects the entirety of the article what is most recent is not necessarily what is most noteworthy : new information should be carefully balanced against old , with due weight accorded to each when a subject dies , the lead need not be radically reworked ; wikipedia is not a memorial site mos guidelines for opening paragraphs should generally be followed , and the opening paragraph of a biographical article should establish notability , neutrally describe the person , and provide context handling of the subject 's name is covered below in gives : & nbsp ; joe bloggs this ensures that readers who hover over the initials see the target article 's url as a hint and in the status bar at the bottom of the window if there is nothing to link to , and a redlink is unlikely to result in eventual creation of an article , use the template to explain the acronym in general , honorific prefixes—styles and honorifics in front of a name—in wikipedia 's own voice should not be included , but may be discussed in the article in burmese names , honorifics may be preserved if they are part of the normal form of address , even for ordinary people see wikipedia : naming conventions ( royalty and nobility ) for use in article titles the honorific titles sir , dame , lord and lady are included in the initial reference and infobox heading for the subject of a biographical article , but are optional after that except for the initial reference and infobox , do not add honorific titles to existing instances of a person 's name where they are absent , because doing so implies that the existing version is incorrect ( similar in spirit to the wikipedia : manual of style ( spelling ) ) where the use of an honorific title is widely misunderstood , this can be mentioned in the article ; see , for example , bob geldof wikipedia : biography dos and don'ts ( information page summarizing the key points of this guideline ) wikipedia : autobiography wikipedia : wikiproject biography wikipedia : categorization of people wikipedia : naming conventions ( people ) wikipedia : biographies of living persons

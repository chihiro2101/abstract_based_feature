when a subject dies , the lead need not be radically reworked ; wikipedia is not a memorial site unless the cause of death is itself a reason for notability , a single sentence describing the death is usually sufficient , and often none is included in the lead at all , just a death date mos guidelines for opening paragraphs should generally be followed , and the opening paragraph of a biographical article should establish notability , neutrally describe the person , and provide context if there is nothing to link to , and a redlink is unlikely to result in eventual creation of an article , use the template to explain the acronym they are not usually used in running text , though some may be appropriate in the lead sentence of a biographical article , as detailed below , or in a section about the person 's titles and styles in general , honorific prefixes—styles and honorifics in front of a name—in wikipedia 's own voice should not be included , but may be discussed in the article there are some exceptions : where an honorific is so wp : commonname that the name is rarely found in english wp : rs without it , it should be included for example , an honorific may be used for '' mrs the honorific titles sir , dame , lord and lady are included in the initial reference and infobox heading for the subject of a biographical article , but are optional after that when making the change upon the death of a subject , the entire article should be reviewed for consistency if you 're giving a precise date range from the past to the present , as with a living person 's age or career , you may use the '' age '' template in general , present a biography in chronological order , from birth to death , except where there is good reason to do otherwise a person 's sexual orientation or activities should usually not be mentioned in the article lead unless related to the person 's notability

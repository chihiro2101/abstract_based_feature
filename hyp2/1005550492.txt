adherents to green politics tend to consider it to be part of a higher worldview and not simply a political ideology green politics draws its ethical stance from a variety of sources , from the values of indigenous peoples , to the ethics of mahatma gandhi , baruch spinoza and jakob von uexküll '' green politics '' first began as conservation and preservation movements , such as the sierra club , founded in san francisco in 1892 left-green platforms of the form that make up the green parties today draw terminology from the science of ecology , and policy from environmentalism , deep ecology , feminism , pacifism , anarchism , libertarian socialism , libertarian possibilism , social democracy , eco-socialism , and/or social ecology or green libertarianism the green party political movement is not to be confused with the unrelated fact that in some far-right and fascist parties , nationalism has on occasion been tied into a sort of green politics which promotes environmentalism as a form of pride in the '' motherland '' according to a minority of authors the kabouters were an outgrowth of provo 's environmental white plans and they proposed '' groene plannen '' ( '' green plans '' ) the first political party to be created with its basis in environmental issues was the united tasmania group , founded in australia in march 1972 to fight against deforestation and the creation of a dam that would damage lake pedder ; whilst it only gained three percent in state elections , it had , according to derek wall , '' inspired the creation of green parties all over the world in may 1972 , a meeting at victoria university of wellington , new zealand , launched the values party , the world 's first countrywide green party to contest parliamentary seats nationally the german green party was not the first green party in europe to have members elected nationally but the impression was created that they had been , because they attracted the most media attention : the german greens , contended in their first national election in the 1980 federal election after contesting the 1979 european elections they held a conference which identified four pillars of the green party which all groups in the original alliance could agree as the basis of a common party platform : welding these groups together as a single party the term '' green '' was coined by one of the founders of the german green party , petra kelly , after she visited australia and saw the actions of the builders labourers federation and their green ban actions it was not registered as an official party , but some participants in that effort went on to form the green party of canada in 1983 ( the ontario greens and british columbia greens were also formed that year ) current green party of canada leader elizabeth may was the instigator and one of the candidates of the small party and she was eventually elected as a member of the green party in 2011 canadian federal election in finland , the green league became the first european green party to form part of a state-level cabinet in 1995 the german greens followed , forming a government with the social democratic party of germany ( the '' red-green alliance '' ) from 1998 to 2005 in latvia , indulis emsis , leader of the green party and part of the union of greens and farmers , an alliance of a nordic agrarian party and the green party , was prime minister of latvia for ten months in 2004 , making him the first green politician to lead a country in the history of the world in the german state of baden-württemberg , the green party became the leader of the coalition with the social democrats after finishing second in the 2011 baden-württemberg state election the global greens charter identified six guiding principles : ecological wisdom social justice participatory democracy nonviolence sustainability respect for diversity according to green economics , the present generation should not borrow from future generations , but rather attempt to achieve what tim jackson calls '' prosperity without growth '' giuseppe ferrari ( 2008 ) green and grey in dutch environmentalism : debates and philosophical implications , environmental sciences , 5:3 , 191-204 , doi : 10.1080/15693430802299114 therefore , adherents to green politics advocate economic policies designed to safeguard the environment on the contrary , greens look to a green tax shift that are seen to encourage both producers and consumers to make ecologically friendly choices this is not a universal policy of greens , as green liberals and green conservatism support a regulated free market economy with additional measures to advance sustainable development greens on the left are often identified as eco-socialism , who merge ecology and environmentalism with socialism and marxism and blame the capitalist system for environmental degradation , social injustice , inequality and conflict this belief is documented in the business experiences of eco-capitalists in the book , the gort cloud that describes the gort cloud as the green community that supports eco-friendly businesses according to its adherents , it is crucial that citizens play a direct role in the decisions that influence their lives and their environment therefore , green politics seeks to increase the role of deliberative democracy , based on direct citizen involvement and consensus decision making , wherever it is feasible indeed , many green parties emphasize individual and grassroots action at the local and regional levels over election green politics is usually said to include the green anarchism , eco-anarchism , green libertarianism , green liberalism , anti-nuclear movements , and peace movements , although these often claim not to be aligned with any party some greens on the left adhere to eco-socialism , an ideology that combines ecology , environmentalism , socialism , and marxism to criticize the capitalist system as the cause of ecological crises , social exclusion , inequality , and conflict

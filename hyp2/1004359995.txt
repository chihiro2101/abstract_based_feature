in france and spain , croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter , but sometimes with almond filling in the levant , croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate , cheese , almonds , or zaatar in germany , croissants are sometimes filled with nutella or persipan ; in southern germany , there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with lye ( laugencroissant ) in the german-speaking part of switzerland , the croissant is typically called a gipfeli ; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the french-style croissant a cousin of the croissant is the italian cornetto ( in the center and south ) or brioche ( in the north ) typically , croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment , for a longer time than other pastry generally , there are two methods for folding fat into the dough : the english method and the french method the exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat , while the other end ( one predough and one fat layer ) is folded on top croissant dough is typically laminated until 16–50 fat layers are obtained on one hand , a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids on the other hand , a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift first , the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size also known as '' pastry lift '' or '' dough lift , '' the dough expands as water is converted to steam , thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer the role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation : hydration and deformation hydrated glutenin proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive the slightly swollen granules are found in the spaces between the gluten network , thus contributing to the consistency of the dough first , chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development , as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough ’ s hydration time , consistency , and required amount of mixing energy secondly , cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later , which better facilitates the latter ’ s incorporation the formation of thin , well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift the role of fat also influences the separation of layers , as will be discussed next roll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant as previously stated , the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift butter and margarine are both water-in-oil emulsions , composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil on the other hand , kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling generally , a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift if the fat is firmer than the dough , then the dough can rupture thus , to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift , croissants usually contain fewer layers than other puff pastries with more bonds being made , the gluten network becomes more rigid , strengthening the croissant ’ s crumb texture the water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat on a molecular level , water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and gluten network on one hand , an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking

the only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the pool , near the site of the present merseyside police headquarters in 1330 , his son edward iii granted a charter to the priory and its successors for ever : '' the right of ferry there… for men , horses and goods , with leave to charge reasonable tolls '' the chester indictments record criminal activities on the mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries in 1355 , richard , son of simon de becheton , was murdered on the ferry ; the murderers escaped and took refuge at shotwick the mersey is famed for its thick fogs , and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate by the 18th century , the commercial expansion of liverpool and the increase in stage coach traffic from chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 the first steamship to operate on the mersey was the elizabeth , a wooden paddle steamer , which was introduced in 1815 to operate between liverpool and runcorn at woodside , a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth , and in 1822 the paddle steamer royal mail began commercial operation between liverpool and woodside the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier in 1838 , the monks ferry company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of woodside , but this service closed in 1878 from about 1830 , steam ferries also operated from the new resort developed by james atherton at new brighton , and from nearby egremont in the early 1840s , the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end the first portion , known as the georges ' landing stage , was designed by william cubitt and was 500 feet long all of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under municipal ownership in the mid 19th century at woodside , land between the woodside hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed , and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened the pontoons were towed into position , moored by chains originally made for the ss great eastern , and linked to the mainland by two double bridges in 1886 the mersey railway tunnel was opened , providing competition for the ferry services in 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry in 1914 king george v and queen mary travelled on the ferry s.s during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the damage caused by enemy gun fire has been repaired '' the early incarnations of today 's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships , mainly the 1906 pair , royal iris and royal daffodil as built , the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level , however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level they were all fitted with ahead and astern reciprocating engines and most vessels could achieve a speed of around 12 knots , which is about the same as today 's trio of ferries birkenhead changed to orange and black after the second world war when the railway tunnels were constructed and opened , the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular it was really the advent of the road tunnels that caused trouble both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats , which carried vehicles and goods across the river due to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage , birkenhead corporation gradually closed its southern terminals ; new ferry ( officially ) on 22 september 1927 , eastham in 1929 and rock ferry on 30 june 1939 as a result , the egremont service never reopened the upton vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in liverpool bay as a result of the transport act 1968 , the transport functions of both wallasey and birkenhead corporations came under the control of the merseytravel ( mpte ) on 1 december 1969 in spite of the close proximity of wallasey and birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages , each corporation had used different gangway spacing on their vessels this meant that a wallasey ferry could not utilise both gangways at birkenhead 's terminal at woodside , and that a birkenhead boat would be similarly disadvantaged at seacombe and new brighton when the combined ferry fleet was rationalised , seacombe ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the birkenhead vessels compounded with the opening of the kingsway tunnel on 28 june 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers ( only 4,000-5,000 a day ) , the future of the service was uncertain it was sentimental , rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries , after much public protest to keep them during this period , maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably , with the woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for mountwood and overchurch at this time , the large brass helm from overchurch was damaged and was replaced by that from woodchurch for the duration of the international garden festival , a special ferry service was provided to otterspool promenade the ferries also began to operate summer manchester ship canal cruises , a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened , but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s as a result , many buses which formerly stopped at the birkenhead woodside bus/ferry terminal were extended into liverpool from 1990 a commuter shuttle has operated monday-friday peak period with an hourly river explorer cruise the morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a liverpool-birkehead-seacombe-liverpool circuit , but since then only runs every 20 minutes from liverpool-seacombe ferry and back the evening peak service runs liverpool-seacombe every 20 minutes in the summer there are also cruises up the manchester ship canal both ferries were badly damaged but returned home to a triumphant greeting when the ferries entered service they all had wallasey white and black funnel liveries she was then moved to the ferries ' regular berth on the east float , where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season mountwood and woodchurch were also refitted and renamed royal iris of the mersey and snowdrop , respectively in 2002 and 2004 in august 2012 , it was announced that merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on mersey ferries operations after the service is running at a £1 million annual loss plans were announced in august 2019 for two new low-carbon ferries to be built and for improvement works to take place at seacombe ferry terminal

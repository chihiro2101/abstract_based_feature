the monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river at this time , the mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to ainsdale beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near otterspool the only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the pool , near the site of the present merseyside police headquarters in 1317 , a royal licence was issued , granting permission to the priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at woodside king edward ii visited liverpool in 1323 , and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to ince in 1330 , his son edward iii granted a charter to the priory and its successors for ever : '' the right of ferry there… for men , horses and goods , with leave to charge reasonable tolls '' the chester indictments record criminal activities on the mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries in 1355 , richard , son of simon de becheton , was murdered on the ferry ; the murderers escaped and took refuge at shotwick early ferries also existed across the mersey further upstream , at ince and at runcorn ownership reverted to the crown , and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the priory properties were bought by ralph worsley of lancashire for £586 the mersey is famed for its thick fogs , and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate ferry services from rock house on the wirral – that is , rock ferry – were first recorded in 1709 by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 there was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel at woodside , a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth , and in 1822 the paddle steamer royal mail began commercial operation between liverpool and woodside in 1820 , the birkenhead ferry began operating from a new site just to the south ; this closed in 1870 the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier from about 1830 , steam ferries also operated from the new resort developed by james atherton at new brighton , and from nearby egremont in 1847 , the first floating landing stage , which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time , was opened at liverpool until the establishment of the mersey railway in 1886 , the ferries were the only means of crossing the river , and so all of the routes were heavily used the pontoons were towed into position , moored by chains originally made for the ss great eastern , and linked to the mainland by two double bridges the cheshire , the first passenger ferry steamer to have a saloon , operated from woodside in 1864 the iron pier at eastham was built in 1874 on 26 november 1878 , the ferry gem , a paddle steamer operated from seacombe by the wallasey local board , collided with the bowfell , a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the river mersey ; five people died as a result in 1886 the mersey railway tunnel was opened , providing competition for the ferry services the woodside ferry service began using twin-screw passenger steamers in 1890 , which replaced paddle steamers the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the ferries had a shallow draft , allowing them to skim over the mines floating beneath the surface , and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended mole curling into the north sea because of their work king george v allowed the vessels to use the word '' royal '' in their name the wallasey twin screw vessels all had flying bridges with port and starboard docking cabs when the queensway road tunnel opened in 1934 , the ferry service from seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry due to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage , birkenhead corporation gradually closed its southern terminals ; new ferry ( officially ) on 22 september 1927 , eastham in 1929 and rock ferry on 30 june 1939 the closure of eastham marked the last use of ferry paddle steamers on the river wallasey were always trying to close egremont , but faced stiff opposition from locals who got petitions to keep the ferry open in 1941 , mines which had drifted into the river mersey stopped ferry crossings in 1950 , the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year , including 11 million on the woodside ferries and 15 million on seacombe ferries , but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million night boats across the river were withdrawn and replaced by buses through the tunnel in 1956 when the combined ferry fleet was rationalised , seacombe ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the birkenhead vessels compounded with the opening of the kingsway tunnel on 28 june 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers ( only 4,000-5,000 a day ) , the future of the service was uncertain however , service frequency was reduced , with ferry fares being linked to bus and rail fares during this period , maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably , with the woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for mountwood and overchurch this was another blow to the mersey ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic , which had declined , to tourist needs these operations run with a bias towards seacombe ferry as the vicinity of seacombe lacks the rail and bus connections of birkenhead the '' royal '' prefix was granted to the ferries iris and daffodil for their service during the first world war where they were instrumental at the mole in zeebrugge both ferries were badly damaged but returned home to a triumphant greeting the royal daffodil ii was hit by a bomb and sunk at her berth in the second world war , but later raised and returned to service , with little of her pre-war splendour perhaps the most famous royal is the royal iris of 1951 the two vessels were primarily used on the seacombe - liverpool service , augmenting the new brighton run during the summer seasons when the ferries were taken over by the pte , they lost their original liveries and these were swiftly replaced with sky blue and primrose yellow she was then moved to the ferries ' regular berth on the east float , where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season the new wärtsilä engines fitted on the ferries are much more economical than the previous engines by crossley bros of manchester as a result of this review , the ferry royal daffodil was withdrawn from service in january 2013 history and images official mersey ferries website photographs of mersey ferries film of the mersey ferries getting places : commuter ferries short film of seacombe ferry in 1901

the monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river the only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the pool , near the site of the present merseyside police headquarters weather often stopped crossings and passengers were delayed for days , taking shelter at the priory king edward ii visited liverpool in 1323 , and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to ince the chester indictments record criminal activities on the mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries early ferries also existed across the mersey further upstream , at ince and at runcorn ownership reverted to the crown , and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the priory properties were bought by ralph worsley of lancashire for Â£586 by 1541 william bromley had the licence for ferries at seacombe , and in 1586 , queen elizabeth granted john poole of sutton the rights at tranmere the mersey is famed for its thick fogs , and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate by the 18th century , the commercial expansion of liverpool and the increase in stage coach traffic from chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 the first steamship to operate on the mersey was the elizabeth , a wooden paddle steamer , which was introduced in 1815 to operate between liverpool and runcorn there was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel these were long piers that were mounted on wheels and , by using a steam engine , could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide at woodside , a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth , and in 1822 the paddle steamer royal mail began commercial operation between liverpool and woodside in 1820 , the birkenhead ferry began operating from a new site just to the south ; this closed in 1870 the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier in 1838 , the monks ferry company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of woodside , but this service closed in 1878 from about 1830 , steam ferries also operated from the new resort developed by james atherton at new brighton , and from nearby egremont there were also competing ferry services and disputes over the rights granted to the monks , and there was a need to improve the facilities at woodside in 1847 , the first floating landing stage , which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time , was opened at liverpool until the establishment of the mersey railway in 1886 , the ferries were the only means of crossing the river , and so all of the routes were heavily used at woodside , land between the woodside hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed , and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened in 1886 the mersey railway tunnel was opened , providing competition for the ferry services the ferry service at tranmere , which had operated since mediaeval times , closed in 1897 the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry in 1914 king george v and queen mary travelled on the ferry s.s during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the ferries had a shallow draft , allowing them to skim over the mines floating beneath the surface , and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended mole curling into the north sea the early incarnations of today 's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships , mainly the 1906 pair , royal iris and royal daffodil the wallasey twin screw vessels all had flying bridges with port and starboard docking cabs on early paddlers , the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam , and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different birkenhead did not use flying bridges , instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level wallasey ferries employed a funnel livery of white and black and birkenhead red and black when the queensway road tunnel opened in 1934 , the ferry service from seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry by the 1940s , luggage boat services from both woodside and seacombe to liverpool had ceased the closure of eastham marked the last use of ferry paddle steamers on the river the chance came to close egremont during the second world war for economical reasons , after the pier was damaged in a collision as a result , the egremont service never reopened in 1941 , mines which had drifted into the river mersey stopped ferry crossings the oxton and bebington vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload united states aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the liverpool landing stage as a result of the transport act 1968 , the transport functions of both wallasey and birkenhead corporations came under the control of the merseytravel ( mpte ) on 1 december 1969 by this time , new brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage , the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971 , with the stage and pier subsequently demolished in spite of the close proximity of wallasey and birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages , each corporation had used different gangway spacing on their vessels when the combined ferry fleet was rationalised , seacombe ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the birkenhead vessels during this period , maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably , with the woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for mountwood and overchurch as a result , many buses which formerly stopped at the birkenhead woodside bus/ferry terminal were extended into liverpool this was another blow to the mersey ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic , which had declined , to tourist needs the morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a liverpool-birkehead-seacombe-liverpool circuit , but since then only runs every 20 minutes from liverpool-seacombe ferry and back the evening peak service runs liverpool-seacombe every 20 minutes the former royal daffodil ii was converted to a container ship , but still retained its forward section largely in its original condition the current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of royal iris of the mersey and the snowdrop as a result of this review , the ferry royal daffodil was withdrawn from service in january 2013 the vessel will be used as the main day to day vessel with snowdrop used as a secondary vessel

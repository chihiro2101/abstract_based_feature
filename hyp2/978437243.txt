at this time , the mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to ainsdale beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near otterspool in 1317 , a royal licence was issued , granting permission to the priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at woodside king edward ii visited liverpool in 1323 , and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to ince the chester indictments record criminal activities on the mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries from the 16th to the 18th century the monks of birkenhead priory operated a ferry service until the dissolution of the monasteries and the priory 's destruction by henry viii 's troops in 1536 6d ( current value - almost £205,000 ) by 1541 william bromley had the licence for ferries at seacombe , and in 1586 , queen elizabeth granted john poole of sutton the rights at tranmere the use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed , but in reality these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather the mersey is famed for its thick fogs , and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate ferry services from rock house on the wirral – that is , rock ferry – were first recorded in 1709 by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 these were long piers that were mounted on wheels and , by using a steam engine , could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide in 1820 , the birkenhead ferry began operating from a new site just to the south ; this closed in 1870 the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier in 1838 , the monks ferry company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of woodside , but this service closed in 1878 the railway to chester had opened , the town was growing quickly , and the docks were under construction until the establishment of the mersey railway in 1886 , the ferries were the only means of crossing the river , and so all of the routes were heavily used the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the ferries had a shallow draft , allowing them to skim over the mines floating beneath the surface , and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended mole curling into the north sea they both saw action , which was described on 24 april 1918 by roger keyes , 1st baron keyes of the royal navy in a message to the ferries ' manager : '' i am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried bluejackets and marines to zeebrugge , and remained alongside the mole for an hour , greatly contributing to the success of the operation the early incarnations of today 's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships , mainly the 1906 pair , royal iris and royal daffodil as built , the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level , however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level they were all fitted with ahead and astern reciprocating engines and most vessels could achieve a speed of around 12 knots , which is about the same as today 's trio of ferries on early paddlers , the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam , and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different birkenhead did not use flying bridges , instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level wallasey ferries employed a funnel livery of white and black and birkenhead red and black both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats , which carried vehicles and goods across the river as a result , the egremont service never reopened in 1941 , mines which had drifted into the river mersey stopped ferry crossings the upton vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in liverpool bay in 1950 , the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year , including 11 million on the woodside ferries and 15 million on seacombe ferries , but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million the mpte takes over as a result of the transport act 1968 , the transport functions of both wallasey and birkenhead corporations came under the control of the merseytravel ( mpte ) on 1 december 1969 by this time , new brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage , the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971 , with the stage and pier subsequently demolished in spite of the close proximity of wallasey and birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages , each corporation had used different gangway spacing on their vessels when the combined ferry fleet was rationalised , seacombe ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the birkenhead vessels it was sentimental , rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries , after much public protest to keep them during this period , maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably , with the woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for mountwood and overchurch after the damaged helm was repaired , it was placed on woodchurch 1984 was a momentous year for the ferries and can be seen as the beginning of their rise from the slump of the 1970s this service was usually operated by the overchurch the ferries also began to operate summer manchester ship canal cruises , a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened , but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s sailing ships from the tall ships ' race visited the river in august 1984 , which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days , a level unseen for forty years on 26 october 1986 as a result of the transport act 1985 , bus services were deregulated and restrictions which prevented regular bus services through the mersey tunnels were abolished this was another blow to the mersey ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic , which had declined , to tourist needs the morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a liverpool-birkehead-seacombe-liverpool circuit , but since then only runs every 20 minutes from liverpool-seacombe ferry and back the evening peak service runs liverpool-seacombe every 20 minutes the '' royal '' prefix was granted to the ferries iris and daffodil for their service during the first world war where they were instrumental at the mole in zeebrugge when the ferries were taken over by the pte , they lost their original liveries and these were swiftly replaced with sky blue and primrose yellow she was renamed royal daffodil and returned to service in 1999 as a result of this review , the ferry royal daffodil was withdrawn from service in january 2013 history and images official mersey ferries website photographs of mersey ferries film of the mersey ferries getting

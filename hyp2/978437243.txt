the monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river in 1317 , a royal licence was issued , granting permission to the priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at woodside king edward ii visited liverpool in 1323 , and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to ince in 1330 , his son edward iii granted a charter to the priory and its successors for ever : '' the right of ferry there… for men , horses and goods , with leave to charge reasonable tolls '' at the time , there was only a small hamlet at birkenhead , and a slightly larger village at liverpool the chester indictments record criminal activities on the mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries in 1355 , richard , son of simon de becheton , was murdered on the ferry ; the murderers escaped and took refuge at shotwick in 1365 , it was recorded that there were four ferryboats operating without a licence , from bromborough and eastham a licence was issued in 1357 to the poole family by edward , the black prince , for a ferry from eastham the monks of birkenhead priory operated a ferry service until the dissolution of the monasteries and the priory 's destruction by henry viii 's troops in 1536 by 1541 william bromley had the licence for ferries at seacombe , and in 1586 , queen elizabeth granted john poole of sutton the rights at tranmere during this period , the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships the use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed , but in reality these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather the mersey is famed for its thick fogs , and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 there was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel for the steam ferry etna , which entered service at tranmere on 17 april 1817 , the idea of extension stages was mooted these were long piers that were mounted on wheels and , by using a steam engine , could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide at woodside , a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth , and in 1822 the paddle steamer royal mail began commercial operation between liverpool and woodside in 1838 , the monks ferry company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of woodside , but this service closed in 1878 from about 1830 , steam ferries also operated from the new resort developed by james atherton at new brighton , and from nearby egremont in the early 1840s , the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end in 1847 , the first floating landing stage , which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time , was opened at liverpool at woodside , land between the woodside hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed , and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened in 1886 the mersey railway tunnel was opened , providing competition for the ferry services the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry in 1914 king george v and queen mary travelled on the ferry s.s during the first world war the steamers iris and daffodil were taken out of service from wallasey to be used as troop ships in the zeebrugge raid in belgium the damage caused by enemy gun fire has been repaired '' they needed extensive refitting before they could resume peacetime activities as built , the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level , however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level birkenhead did not use flying bridges , instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level birkenhead changed to orange and black after the second world war when the queensway road tunnel opened in 1934 , the ferry service from seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry the chance came to close egremont during the second world war for economical reasons , after the pier was damaged in a collision this was in similar circumstances to the demise of new ferry twenty years earlier as a result , the egremont service never reopened in 1941 , mines which had drifted into the river mersey stopped ferry crossings the oxton and bebington vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload united states aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the liverpool landing stage the upton vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in liverpool bay night boats across the river were withdrawn and replaced by buses through the tunnel in 1956 as a result of the transport act 1968 , the transport functions of both wallasey and birkenhead corporations came under the control of the merseytravel ( mpte ) on 1 december 1969 in spite of the close proximity of wallasey and birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages , each corporation had used different gangway spacing on their vessels this meant that a wallasey ferry could not utilise both gangways at birkenhead 's terminal at woodside , and that a birkenhead boat would be similarly disadvantaged at seacombe and new brighton the 1970s economic situation in britain saw costs escalating , with funding limited by the mpte , which was embarking on an expensive operation to construct the merseyrail '' liverpool loop '' extension compounded with the opening of the kingsway tunnel on 28 june 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers ( only 4,000-5,000 a day ) , the future of the service was uncertain this has remained the case , even after both vessels were extensively rebuilt sailing ships from the tall ships ' race visited the river in august 1984 , which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days , a level unseen for forty years this was another blow to the mersey ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic , which had declined , to tourist needs the royal iris remained in service for nearly 40 years before being sold in 1993 - two years after withdrawal - for use as a floating nightclub the overchurch also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units , meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge , rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the mountwood and woodchurch in august 2012 , it was announced that merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on mersey ferries operations after the service is running at a £1 million annual loss plans were announced in august 2019 for two new low-carbon ferries to be built and for improvement works to take place at seacombe ferry terminal history and images official mersey ferries website photographs of mersey ferries film of the mersey ferries getting places :

the monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river the only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the pool , near the site of the present merseyside police headquarters in 1317 , a royal licence was issued , granting permission to the priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at woodside king edward ii visited liverpool in 1323 , and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to ince at the time , there was only a small hamlet at birkenhead , and a slightly larger village at liverpool the chester indictments record criminal activities on the mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries the licence then passed to the abbey of st werburgh , in chester , and became known as job 's ferry early ferries also existed across the mersey further upstream , at ince and at runcorn the monks of birkenhead priory operated a ferry service until the dissolution of the monasteries and the priory 's destruction by henry viii 's troops in 1536 ownership reverted to the crown , and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the priory properties were bought by ralph worsley of lancashire for £586 during this period , the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships the use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed , but in reality these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather the mersey is famed for its thick fogs , and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate ferry services from rock house on the wirral – that is , rock ferry – were first recorded in 1709 by 1753 the cheshire side of the mersey had at least five ferry houses at ince , eastham , the rock , woodside and seacombe the service from new ferry to liverpool was first mentioned in 1774 the first steamship to operate on the mersey was the elizabeth , a wooden paddle steamer , which was introduced in 1815 to operate between liverpool and runcorn in 1820 , the birkenhead ferry began operating from a new site just to the south ; this closed in 1870 the woodside , north birkenhead and liverpool steam ferry company was formed in 1835 , and the slipway at woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier in 1838 , the monks ferry company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of woodside , but this service closed in 1878 steam ferries also began operating from eastham the railway to chester had opened , the town was growing quickly , and the docks were under construction in the early 1840s , the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end in 1847 , the first floating landing stage , which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time , was opened at liverpool all of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under municipal ownership in the mid 19th century at woodside , land between the woodside hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed , and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened on 26 november 1878 , the ferry gem , a paddle steamer operated from seacombe by the wallasey local board , collided with the bowfell , a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the river mersey ; five people died as a result in 1886 the mersey railway tunnel was opened , providing competition for the ferry services the woodside ferry service began using twin-screw passenger steamers in 1890 , which replaced paddle steamers in 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day the pier and landing stage at rock ferry was built in 1899 , and birkenhead corporation also operated the ferry service at new ferry in 1914 king george v and queen mary travelled on the ferry s.s because of their work king george v allowed the vessels to use the word '' royal '' in their name the early incarnations of today 's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships , mainly the 1906 pair , royal iris and royal daffodil the wallasey twin screw vessels all had flying bridges with port and starboard docking cabs birkenhead did not use flying bridges , instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level when the railway tunnels were constructed and opened , the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats , which carried vehicles and goods across the river due to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage , birkenhead corporation gradually closed its southern terminals ; new ferry ( officially ) on 22 september 1927 , eastham in 1929 and rock ferry on 30 june 1939 the closure of eastham marked the last use of ferry paddle steamers on the river the oxton and bebington vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload united states aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the liverpool landing stage by this time , new brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage , the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971 , with the stage and pier subsequently demolished compounded with the opening of the kingsway tunnel on 28 june 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers ( only 4,000-5,000 a day ) , the future of the service was uncertain it was sentimental , rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries , after much public protest to keep them during this period , maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably , with the woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for mountwood and overchurch at this time , the large brass helm from overchurch was damaged and was replaced by that from woodchurch this service was usually operated by the overchurch the ferries also began to operate summer manchester ship canal cruises , a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened , but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s as a result , many buses which formerly stopped at the birkenhead woodside bus/ferry terminal were extended into liverpool this was another blow to the mersey ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic , which had declined , to tourist needs these operations run with a bias towards seacombe ferry as the vicinity of seacombe lacks the rail and bus connections of birkenhead in the summer there are also cruises up the manchester ship canal the late 1970s and early 1980s saw very limited budgets for maintenance and the ferries are noted to look in poor condition during this period mountwood and woodchurch were also refitted and renamed royal iris of the mersey and snowdrop , respectively in 2002 and 2004 history and images official mersey ferries website photographs of mersey ferries film of the mersey ferries getting places : commuter ferries short film of seacombe ferry in 1901

in the 5th century bce thucydides was highly concerned with the relations among states however leopold von ranke ( 1795-1886 ) , the leading german historian of the 19th century ce , codified the modern form of diplomatic history ranke wrote largely on the history of early modern europe , using the diplomatic archives of the european powers ( particularly the venetians ) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of europe wie es eigentlich gewesen ( '' as it actually happened '' ) ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the '' primacy of foreign affairs '' ( primat der aussenpolitik ) , arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state ranke 's understanding of diplomatic history relied on using as sources the large number of official documents produced by modern western governments ; he argued that historians should examine such sources in an objective and neutral spirit in the early 20th centuries , work by prominent diplomatic historians such as charles webster , harold temperley , alfred pribram , r.h schmitt were mostly concerned with the events such as the napoleonic wars , the congress of vienna and the origins of the franco-german war a notable event in diplomatic history occurred in 1910 when the french government start to publish all of the archives relating to the war of 1870 ranke 's understanding of the dominance of foreign policy , and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history , remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war : : diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation , at once the most important , most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies muriel e chamberlain , pax britannica ' ? british foreign policy 1789-1914 ( 1988 ) p 1 she adds that after 1945 , the trend reversed , allowing political , intellectual and social history to displace diplomatic history for the first half of the 20th century , most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the primat der aussenpolitik approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces sir winston churchill 's multi-volume the second world war , especially the first volume the gathering storm ( 1948 ) set the framework and the interpretation for much later historiography the fact that a world war started over poland in 1939 was due to diplomatic miscalculation by all the countries concerned , instead of being a case of german aggression historians such as christopher thorne and harry hinsley abandoned the previous focus on individual leaders to discuss the broader societal influences such as public opinion and narrower ones like intelligence on diplomatic relations patrick finney , '' the romance of decline : the historiography of appeasement and british national identity peter jackson , “ post-war politics and the historiography of french strategy and diplomacy before the

result of the rise of the primat der innenpolitik school , diplomatic historians increasing started to pay attention to domestic politics in the 1970s , the conservative german historian andreas hillgruber , together with his close associate klaus hildebrand , was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish german historian hans-ulrich wehler over the merits of the primat der aussenpolitik ( '' primacy of foreign politics '' ) and primat der innenpolitik ( '' primacy of domestic politics '' ) schools hillgruber and hildebrand made a case for the traditional primat der aussenpolitik approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite wehler , who favored the primat der innenpolitik approach , for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history , calling for theoretically-based research , and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question a notable example of the primat der innenpolitik approach was the claim by the british marxist historian timothy mason who claimed that the launch of world war ii in 1939 was best understood as a “ barbaric variant of social imperialism ” kaillis , aristotle fascist ideology , london : routledge , 2000 page 166 mason 's theory of a '' flight into war '' being imposed on hitler generated much controversy , and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian richard overy over this matter in addition , because world war ii was a global war , diplomatic historians start to focus on japanese-american relations to understand why japan had attacked the united states in 1941 , the encyclopedia of historians and historical writing ( 1999 ) pp 314-165 a sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the japanese historian chihiro hosoya , the british historian ian nish , and the american historian akira iriye , which was the first time that asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians in general , the american cold war revisionists tended to focus on american foreign policy decision-making with respect to the genesis of the cold war in the 1940s and on how the united states became involved in vietnam in the 1960s in europe diplomatic history fell out of favor in the late cold war era since the collapse of communism in 1989–91 , however , there has been a renaissance , led especially by historians of the early modern era , in the history of diplomacy the new approach differs from previous perspectives by the wholesale incorporation of perspectives from political science , sociology , the history of mentalities , and cultural history

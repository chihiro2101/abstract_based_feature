the primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects : points , line segments , polygons , polyhedra , etc this brute-force algorithm takes o ( n 2 ) time ; i.e a classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes o ( n log n ) , 118 ( 1 ) :34â€”37,1995 ( pdf ) as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes o ( n log log n ) time , s the core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways , according to various criteria some fundamental problems of this type are : convex hull : given a set of points , find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points delaunay triangulation voronoi diagram : given a set of points , partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points linear programming closest pair of points : given a set of points , find the two with the smallest distance from each other point location : given a partitioning of the space into cells , produce a data structure that efficiently tells in which cell a query point is located in some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries , which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates application areas of computational geometry include shipbuilding , aircraft , and automotive industries .

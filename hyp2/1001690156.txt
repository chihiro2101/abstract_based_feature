the primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects : points , line segments , polygons , polyhedra , etc consider , for example , the closest pair problem : given n points in the plane , find the two with the smallest distance from each other the core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways , according to various criteria some fundamental problems of this type are : convex hull : given a set of points , find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points delaunay triangulation voronoi diagram : given a set of points , partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points linear programming closest pair of points : given a set of points , find the two with the smallest distance from each other farthest pair of points largest empty circle : given a set of points , find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them euclidean shortest path : connect two points in a euclidean space ( with polyhedral obstacles ) by a shortest path any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one , at the cost of increased processing time for example , in many applications of computer graphics a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a pointer in some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries , which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates

the primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects : points , line segments , polygons , polyhedra , etc consider , for example , the closest pair problem : given n points in the plane , find the two with the smallest distance from each other a classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes o ( n log n ) the core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways , according to various criteria in the problems of this category , some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found some fundamental problems of this type are : convex hull : given a set of points , find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points in geometric query problems , commonly known as geometric search problems , the input consists of two parts : the search space part and the query part , which varies over the problem instances ray tracing : given a set of objects in space , produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first if the search space is fixed , the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by : the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in the time ( and sometimes an extra space ) to answer queries in some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries , which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates this branch is also known as geometric modelling and computer-aided geometric design ( cagd )

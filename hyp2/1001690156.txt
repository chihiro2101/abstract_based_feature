the primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects : points , line segments , polygons , polyhedra , etc some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of computers consider , for example , the closest pair problem : given n points in the plane , find the two with the smallest distance from each other one could compute the distances between all the pairs of points , of which there are n ( n-1 ) /2 , then pick the pair with the smallest distance a classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes o ( n log n ) the core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways , according to various criteria some fundamental geometric query problems are : range searching : preprocess a set of points , in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region algorithms for problems of this type typically involve dynamic data structures any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one , at the cost of increased processing time in some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries , which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates application areas of computational geometry include shipbuilding , aircraft , and automotive industries .

early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction the most common form of memory through the 1960s was magnetic-core memory , which stored data in the polarity of small magnets since the magnets held their state even with the power removed , core memory was also non-volatile other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density today dynamic ram forms the vast majority of a typical computer 's main memory many systems require at least some non-volatile memory desktop computers require permanent storage of the instructions required to load the operating system by applying higher power than normal , a selected diode can be '' burned out '' ( like a fuse ) , thereby permanently setting that bit to '' 0 '' many semiconductor manufacturers provided a prom version of their mask rom part , so that development firmware could be tested before ordering a mask rom currently , the best-known form of both nv-ram and eeprom memory is flash memory several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles , and some even claim to be a truly universal memory , offering the performance of the best sram devices with the non-volatility of flash ) before industry standardization on the ibm pc architecture , some other microcomputer models used battery-backed ram more extensively : for example , in the trs-80 model 100/tandy 102 , all of the main memory ( 8 kb minimum , 32 kb maximum ) is battery-backed sram the basis of flash memory is identical to eeprom , and differs largely in internal layout unlike ram devices , f-ram retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted , due to the pzt crystal maintaining polarity the areal density of these parts appears to be even higher than modern flash devices , the lower overall storage being due to the lack of multi-bit encoding research has also been done in designing racetrack memory , also called domain wall memory

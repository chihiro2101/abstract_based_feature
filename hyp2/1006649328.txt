early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction the most common form of memory through the 1960s was magnetic-core memory , which stored data in the polarity of small magnets since the magnets held their state even with the power removed , core memory was also non-volatile other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density today dynamic ram forms the vast majority of a typical computer 's main memory many systems require at least some non-volatile memory the memory contents were stored as a pattern of the last mask used for manufacturing the integrated circuit , and so could not be modified once completed currently , the best-known form of both nv-ram and eeprom memory is flash memory those who required real ram-like performance and non-volatility typically have had to use conventional ram devices and a battery backup for consoles such as the sega genesis ) included battery-backed ram to retain saved games , high scores , and similar data a huge advance in nvram technology was the introduction of the floating-gate mosfet transistor , which led to the introduction of erasable programmable read-only memory , or eprom this process has the disadvantage of mechanically degrading the chip , however , so memory systems based on floating-gate transistors in general have short write-lifetimes , on the order of 10 5 writes to any particular bit memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems , and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available unlike ram devices , f-ram retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted , due to the pzt crystal maintaining polarity stt-mram appears to allow for much higher densities than those of the first generation , but is lagging behind flash for the same reasons as feram & ndash ; enormous competitive pressures in the flash market research has also been done in designing racetrack memory , also called domain wall memory

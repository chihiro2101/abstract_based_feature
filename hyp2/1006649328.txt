early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction the most common form of memory through the 1960s was magnetic-core memory , which stored data in the polarity of small magnets since the magnets held their state even with the power removed , core memory was also non-volatile other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density today dynamic ram forms the vast majority of a typical computer 's main memory many systems require at least some non-volatile memory embedded systems , such as an engine control computer for a car , must retain their instructions when power is removed the memory contents were stored as a pattern of the last mask used for manufacturing the integrated circuit , and so could not be modified once completed many semiconductor manufacturers provided a prom version of their mask rom part , so that development firmware could be tested before ordering a mask rom currently , the best-known form of both nv-ram and eeprom memory is flash memory several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles , and some even claim to be a truly universal memory , offering the performance of the best sram devices with the non-volatility of flash for consoles such as the sega genesis ) included battery-backed ram to retain saved games , high scores , and similar data memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems , and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available in addition , the high power needed to write the cells is a problem in low-power roles , where nvram is often used unlike ram devices , f-ram retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted , due to the pzt crystal maintaining polarity an alternative application of ( hafnium oxide based ) ferroelectrics is fe fet based memory , which utilises a ferroelectric between the gate and device of a field-effect transistor

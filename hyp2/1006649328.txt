early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction the most common form of memory through the 1960s was magnetic-core memory , which stored data in the polarity of small magnets since the magnets held their state even with the power removed , core memory was also non-volatile other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density today dynamic ram forms the vast majority of a typical computer 's main memory many systems require at least some non-volatile memory desktop computers require permanent storage of the instructions required to load the operating system embedded systems , such as an engine control computer for a car , must retain their instructions when power is removed many systems used a combination of ram and some form of rom for these roles the memory contents were stored as a pattern of the last mask used for manufacturing the integrated circuit , and so could not be modified once completed currently , the best-known form of both nv-ram and eeprom memory is flash memory '' a survey of architectural approaches for managing embedded dram and non-volatile on-chip caches '' , mittal et al unlike ram devices , f-ram retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted , due to the pzt crystal maintaining polarity ramtron international has developed , produced , and licensed ferroelectric ram ( f-ram ) , and other companies that have licensed and produced f-ram technology include texas instruments , rohm , and fujitsu only one mram chip has entered production to date : everspin technologies ' 4 mbit part , which is a first-generation mram that utilizes cross-point field induced writing research has also been done in designing racetrack memory , also called domain wall memory

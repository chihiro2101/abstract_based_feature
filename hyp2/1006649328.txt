early computers used core and drum memory systems which were non-volatile as a byproduct of their construction the most common form of memory through the 1960s was magnetic-core memory , which stored data in the polarity of small magnets since the magnets held their state even with the power removed , core memory was also non-volatile other memory types required constant power to retain data , such as vacuum tube or solid-state flip-flops , williams tubes , and semiconductor memory ( static or dynamic ram ) advances in semiconductor fabrication in the 1970s led to a new generation of solid state memories that magnetic-core memory could not match on cost or density today dynamic ram forms the vast majority of a typical computer 's main memory many systems require at least some non-volatile memory desktop computers require permanent storage of the instructions required to load the operating system embedded systems , such as an engine control computer for a car , must retain their instructions when power is removed many semiconductor manufacturers provided a prom version of their mask rom part , so that development firmware could be tested before ordering a mask rom currently , the best-known form of both nv-ram and eeprom memory is flash memory several newer technologies are attempting to replace flash in certain roles , and some even claim to be a truly universal memory , offering the performance of the best sram devices with the non-volatility of flash a huge advance in nvram technology was the introduction of the floating-gate mosfet transistor , which led to the introduction of erasable programmable read-only memory , or eprom memory storage density is the main determinant of cost in most computer memory systems , and due to this flash has evolved into one of the lowest cost solid-state memory devices available unlike ram devices , f-ram retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted , due to the pzt crystal maintaining polarity the areal density of these parts appears to be even higher than modern flash devices , the lower overall storage being due to the lack of multi-bit encoding several concepts of molecular-scale memory devices have been developed recently

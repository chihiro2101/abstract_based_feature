this island , which has the greatest concentration of fortifications was renamed gustavssvärd ( king gustav 's sword ) ( fi : kustaanmiekka ) during the construction by sweden instead of using the normal finnish postal addressing scheme ( consisting of a street name and a house number ) , the addresses at suomenlinna consist of a letter code for the island and then a house number early on in the great northern war , russia took advantage of swedish weakness in ingria ( sv : ingermanland ) and captured the area near the neva river as well as the swedish forts , nyen and nöteborg , built to protect it the main swedish naval base at karlskrona was too far to the south to meet sweden 's new needs for its navy in the 18th century , which often resulted in swedish ships reaching the coast of finland only after russian ships and troops had either started or completed their spring campaigns the lack of coastal defenses was keenly felt with russian landings in helsingfors in the spring of 1713 and the swedish failure to blockade the hanko peninsula in 1714 a russian naval campaign against the swedish coast towards the end of the great northern war further outlined the need to develop finnish coastal defenses immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in finland however , nothing with regard to sveaborg took place until the end of russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) the following russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) , which quickly turned from a swedish attack into a russian occupation of finland , again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in finland lack of base of operations for naval forces made it difficult for the swedish navy to operate in the area augustin ehrensvärd ( 1710 & ndash ; 1772 ) , a young lieutenant colonel , was given the responsibility of designing the fortresses and directing construction operations ehrensvärd 's plan contained two fortifications : a sea fortress at svartholm near the small town of lovisa , and a larger sea fortress and naval base ( sveaborg ) at helsingfors in addition to the island fortress itself , seafacing fortifications on the mainland would ensure that an enemy could not acquire a beach-head from which to stage attacks on the sea fort due to repeated russian threats in 1749 and 1750 , more effort was placed on the island fortifications at the expense of those on the mainland , so that a safe base of operations could be secured for the swedish naval units along the finnish coast this period in swedish history was known as the age of liberty , during which the kingdom was under increased parliamentary control , divided into two political parties , the hats and the caps however , after 1769 when the hats regained power , ehrensvärd was again placed in command of the swedish archipelago fleet in finland , officially the arméens flotta ( '' fleet of the army '' ) , and returned to sveaborg facilities for constructing ships for the swedish archipelago fleet were built at sveaborg in the 1760s in addition to the construction of the fortifications and ships , naval officer training was started by ehrensvärd at his own expense at sveaborg in 1770 sveaborg was formed and stocked according to the needs of the swedish archipelago fleet and thus was unable to repair and refit the swedish battlefleet after the battle of hogland facilities were also found lacking at sveaborg , especially in the areas intended for taking care of the sick and wounded by cutting the coastal sea route past hangö , russians prevented supplies from being shipped from sweden to sveaborg the swedish fleet finally managed to set sail for its base at karlskrona on 20 november when the baltic sea had already frozen severely enough that ice had to be sawed open before some ships could move the fleet could not overwinter at sveaborg since it lacked the facilities and supplies for fitting the ships 1748 : building of sveaborg ( fortress of svea/sweden - swedish ) , later to be named suomenlinna in 1918 ( fortress of finland - finnish ) , begins under command of augustin ehrensvärd 1921 valtion lentokonetehdas ( state aircraft factory ) started building airplanes and powered ice sleighs in suomenlinna for the finnish air force

the suomenlinna district of helsinki lies southeast of downtown helsinki and consists of eight islands this island , which has the greatest concentration of fortifications was renamed gustavssvärd ( king gustav 's sword ) ( fi : kustaanmiekka ) during the construction by sweden instead of using the normal finnish postal addressing scheme ( consisting of a street name and a house number ) , the addresses at suomenlinna consist of a letter code for the island and then a house number in 1703 , peter the great founded his new capital , saint petersburg , in that easternmost corner of the gulf of finland russia soon became a maritime power and a force to be reckoned with in the baltic sea a russian naval campaign against the swedish coast towards the end of the great northern war further outlined the need to develop finnish coastal defenses immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in finland lack of funds , unwillingness to devote funds for defending finland , and the belief ( arising just before the war ) that russia would be pushed away from the baltic sea were the main causes for the lack of progress the following russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) , which quickly turned from a swedish attack into a russian occupation of finland , again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in finland lack of base of operations for naval forces made it difficult for the swedish navy to operate in the area in addition to the island fortress itself , seafacing fortifications on the mainland would ensure that an enemy could not acquire a beach-head from which to stage attacks on the sea fort the plan was also to stock munitions for the whole finnish contingent of the swedish army and royal swedish navy there initially the soldiers were housed in the vaults of the fortifications , while the officers had specially built quarters integrated into the baroque cityscape composition of the overall plan as the construction work progressed , more residential buildings were built , many following the shape of the fortification lines ehrensvärd and some of the other officers were keen artists who made oil paintings presenting a view of life in the fortress during its construction , and giving the impression of a lively '' fortress town '' community due to repeated russian threats in 1749 and 1750 , more effort was placed on the island fortifications at the expense of those on the mainland , so that a safe base of operations could be secured for the swedish naval units along the finnish coast swedish participation to the seven years ' war halted the construction efforts in 1757 , which also marked the end of the rapid construction phase of sveaborg once again efforts slowed down as garrisons were reduced , and in 1776 sveaborg 's commander reported that he could n't even man one-tenth of the artillery placed in the fort russian control of the waters outside of sveaborg practically blockaded the swedish battlefleet to sveaborg following a pact between alexander i and napoleon , russia launched a finnish war and occupied finland in 1808 '' capturing ‘ the gibraltar of the north ’ : how swedish sveaborg was taken by the russians in 1808 this is one of the features that makes suomenlinna unique : the fortress is not simply a museum but a living community 1748 : building of sveaborg ( fortress of svea/sweden - swedish ) , later to be named suomenlinna in 1918 ( fortress of finland - finnish ) , begins under command of augustin ehrensvärd 1855 : crimean war : anglo-france navy bombards suomenlinna and causes substantial damage 1918 : name suomenlinna becomes the official name of the fortress in finnish while retaining its swedish name sveaborg in swedish

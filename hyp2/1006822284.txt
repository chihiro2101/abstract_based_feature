the suomenlinna district of helsinki lies southeast of downtown helsinki and consists of eight islands early on in the great northern war , russia took advantage of swedish weakness in ingria ( sv : ingermanland ) and captured the area near the neva river as well as the swedish forts , nyen and nöteborg , built to protect it the main swedish naval base at karlskrona was too far to the south to meet sweden 's new needs for its navy in the 18th century , which often resulted in swedish ships reaching the coast of finland only after russian ships and troops had either started or completed their spring campaigns a russian naval campaign against the swedish coast towards the end of the great northern war further outlined the need to develop finnish coastal defenses immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in finland however , nothing with regard to sveaborg took place until the end of russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) the following russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) , which quickly turned from a swedish attack into a russian occupation of finland , again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in finland after lengthy debate , the swedish parliament decided in 1747 to both fortify the russian frontier and establish a naval base at helsingfors as a counter to kronstadt ehrensvärd 's plan contained two fortifications : a sea fortress at svartholm near the small town of lovisa , and a larger sea fortress and naval base ( sveaborg ) at helsingfors there were two main aspects to ehrensvärd 's design for sveaborg : a series of independent fortifications across several linked islands and , at the very heart of the complex , a navy dockyard in addition to the island fortress itself , seafacing fortifications on the mainland would ensure that an enemy could not acquire a beach-head from which to stage attacks on the sea fort the plan was also to stock munitions for the whole finnish contingent of the swedish army and royal swedish navy there construction started in early 1748 kept expanding , and by september there were around 2,500 men building the fortresses ehrensvärd and some of the other officers were keen artists who made oil paintings presenting a view of life in the fortress during its construction , and giving the impression of a lively '' fortress town '' community swedish participation to the seven years ' war halted the construction efforts in 1757 , which also marked the end of the rapid construction phase of sveaborg however , after 1769 when the hats regained power , ehrensvärd was again placed in command of the swedish archipelago fleet in finland , officially the arméens flotta ( '' fleet of the army '' ) , and returned to sveaborg sveaborg was formed and stocked according to the needs of the swedish archipelago fleet and thus was unable to repair and refit the swedish battlefleet after the battle of hogland the swedish fleet finally managed to set sail for its base at karlskrona on 20 november when the baltic sea had already frozen severely enough that ice had to be sawed open before some ships could move while the route to sweden was open again in late 1788 and in early 1789 , russian ships cut the connection from sveaborg to sweden by forming a blockade at porkkala cape following the russian revolution in 1917 , the fortress became a possession of an independent finland there is a minimum-security penal labor colony in suomenlinna , whose inmates work on the maintenance and reconstruction of the fortifications for the general public , suomenlinna is served by ferries all year , and a service tunnel supplying heating , water and electricity was built in 1982 1748 : building of sveaborg ( fortress of svea/sweden - swedish ) , later to be named suomenlinna in 1918 ( fortress of finland - finnish ) , begins under command of augustin ehrensvärd 1914-1917 : a ring of ground and sea fortifications , called krepost sveaborg , is built around helsinki 1918 : name suomenlinna becomes the official name of the fortress in finnish while retaining its swedish name sveaborg in swedish

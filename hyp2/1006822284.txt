the suomenlinna district of helsinki lies southeast of downtown helsinki and consists of eight islands instead of using the normal finnish postal addressing scheme ( consisting of a street name and a house number ) , the addresses at suomenlinna consist of a letter code for the island and then a house number early on in the great northern war , russia took advantage of swedish weakness in ingria ( sv : ingermanland ) and captured the area near the neva river as well as the swedish forts , nyen and nöteborg , built to protect it in 1703 , peter the great founded his new capital , saint petersburg , in that easternmost corner of the gulf of finland russia soon became a maritime power and a force to be reckoned with in the baltic sea the lack of coastal defenses was keenly felt with russian landings in helsingfors in the spring of 1713 and the swedish failure to blockade the hanko peninsula in 1714 a russian naval campaign against the swedish coast towards the end of the great northern war further outlined the need to develop finnish coastal defenses immediately after the war ended the first plans were set in motion in sweden to construct an archipelago fleet and a base of operations for it in finland however , nothing with regard to sveaborg took place until the end of russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) lack of funds , unwillingness to devote funds for defending finland , and the belief ( arising just before the war ) that russia would be pushed away from the baltic sea were the main causes for the lack of progress the following russo-swedish war ( 1741–1743 ) , which quickly turned from a swedish attack into a russian occupation of finland , again underlined the importance of developing fortifications in finland lack of base of operations for naval forces made it difficult for the swedish navy to operate in the area other european states were also concerned about developments regarding russia , especially france , with whom sweden had concluded a military alliance after lengthy debate , the swedish parliament decided in 1747 to both fortify the russian frontier and establish a naval base at helsingfors as a counter to kronstadt ehrensvärd 's plan contained two fortifications : a sea fortress at svartholm near the small town of lovisa , and a larger sea fortress and naval base ( sveaborg ) at helsingfors the plan was also to stock munitions for the whole finnish contingent of the swedish army and royal swedish navy there as the construction work progressed , more residential buildings were built , many following the shape of the fortification lines the substantial fortification work on the islands south of the town brought it a new and unexpected importance this period in swedish history was known as the age of liberty , during which the kingdom was under increased parliamentary control , divided into two political parties , the hats and the caps the swedish fleet finally managed to set sail for its base at karlskrona on 20 november when the baltic sea had already frozen severely enough that ice had to be sawed open before some ships could move the french & ndash ; english & ndash ; ottoman alliance decided to engage russia on two fronts and sent an baltic theatre of the crimean war finnish civil war prison camps the fortress was officially renamed suomenlinna ( castle of finland ) as part of the wave of nationalism suomenlinna has always been much more than just a part of helsinki & mdash ; it is a town within the town 1748 : building of sveaborg ( fortress of svea/sweden - swedish ) , later to be named suomenlinna in 1918 ( fortress of finland - finnish ) , begins under command of augustin ehrensvärd 1918 : name suomenlinna becomes the official name of the fortress in finnish while retaining its swedish name sveaborg in swedish

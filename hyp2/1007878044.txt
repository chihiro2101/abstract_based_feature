water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in china in 31 ad by the 13th century , water wheels powered sawmills and trip hammers , to pull cloth and pound flax and later cotton rags into pulp for making paper water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century in the 18th century involute gears , another mathematical derived design , came into use gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century the newcomen steam engine was first used , to pump water from a mine , in 1712 john smeaton introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s after the early decades of the 19th century , iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century in the mid to late 19th century , hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions , such as positioning tools or work pieces rock and ore crushing had been done for centuries by water powered trip hammers , but trip hammers have been replaced by modern ore crushers and ball mills construction equipment includes cranes , concrete mixers , concrete pumps , cherry pickers and an assortment of power tools powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century internal combustion engines mostly have an efficiency of about 20 % , ic engine 20 % efficient although large diesel engines , such as those used to power ships , may have efficiencies of nearly 50 % when we compare the costs of using an internal combustion engine to a worker to perform work , we notice that an engine can perform more work at a comparative cost

water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in china in 31 ad by the 13th century , water wheels powered sawmills and trip hammers , to pull cloth and pound flax and later cotton rags into pulp for making paper clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines , and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century john smeaton introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s after the early decades of the 19th century , iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery one of the first mechanical devices used in agriculture was the seed drill invented by jethro tull around 1700 mechanized agriculture greatly increased in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries with horse drawn reapers and horse powered threshing machines internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century threshing and harvesting was originally done with attachments for tractors , but in the 1930s independently powered combine harvesters were in use by the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century early production machinery , such as the glass bottle blowing machine ( ca electric-controlled powered tools , single functioned , fixed cycle powered tools , multi-functioned , program controlled powered tools , remote-controlled powered tools , activated by work-piece ( e.g

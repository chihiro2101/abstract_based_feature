water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in china in 31 ad trip hammers are shown crushing ore in de re metallica ( 1555 ) clocks were some of the most complex early mechanical devices clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines , and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century de re metallica contains drawings related to bellows for blast furnaces including a fabrication drawing in the 18th century involute gears , another mathematical derived design , came into use demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s after the early decades of the 19th century , iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery one of the first mechanical devices used in agriculture was the seed drill invented by jethro tull around 1700 in the mid to late 19th century , hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions , such as positioning tools or work pieces by the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century before electrification , mill and factory power was usually transmitted using a line shaft early production machinery , such as the glass bottle blowing machine ( ca for simplification , one can study mechanization as a series of steps mechanization and its level many students refer to this series as indicating basic-to-advanced forms of mechanical society

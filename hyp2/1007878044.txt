water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in china in 31 ad clocks were some of the most complex early mechanical devices clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines , and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century the newcomen steam engine was first used , to pump water from a mine , in 1712 john smeaton introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century after the early decades of the 19th century , iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery . by the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared in the mid to late 19th century , hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions , such as positioning tools or work pieces in manufacturing , mechanization replaced hand methods of making goods powered machinery today usually means either by electric motor or internal combustion engine many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century electrification allowed individual machines to each be powered by a separate motor in what is called unit drive unit drive also allowed much higher speeds , which was especially important for machine tools early production machinery , such as the glass bottle blowing machine ( ca electric-controlled powered tools , single functioned , fixed cycle powered tools , multi-functioned , program controlled powered tools , remote-controlled powered tools , activated by work-piece ( e.g

water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in china in 31 ad by the 13th century , water wheels powered sawmills and trip hammers , to pull cloth and pound flax and later cotton rags into pulp for making paper clock makers were important developers of machine tools including gear and screw cutting machines , and were also involved in the mathematical development of gear designs water powered bellows for blast furnaces , used in china in ancient times , were in use in europe by the 15th century mathematical gear designs were developed in the mid 17th century gear cutting machines came into use in the 18th century john smeaton introduced metal gears and axles to water wheels in the mid to last half of the 18th century demand for metal parts used in textile machinery led to the invention of many machine tools in the late 1700s until the mid-1800s after the early decades of the 19th century , iron increasingly replaced wood in gearing and shafts in textile machinery . by the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared internal combustion began being used for tractors in the early twentieth century in the mid to late 19th century , hydraulic and pneumatic devices were able to power various mechanical actions , such as positioning tools or work pieces by the early 20th century machines developed the ability to perform more complex operations that had previously been done by skilled craftsmen in manufacturing , mechanization replaced hand methods of making goods many of the early machines and machine tools were hand powered , but most changed over to water or steam power by the early 19th century unit drive also allowed much higher speeds , which was especially important for machine tools electric-controlled powered tools , single functioned , fixed cycle powered tools , multi-functioned , program controlled powered tools , remote-controlled powered tools , activated by work-piece ( e.g

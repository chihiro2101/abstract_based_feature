interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave & nbsp ; 1 , the well-known michelson configuration ) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter ( a partially reflecting mirror ) the path difference , the difference in the distance traveled by each beam , creates a phase difference between them it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves if a single beam has been split along two paths , then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths the fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 of the original source s & nbsp ; 2a , the optical elements are oriented so that s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 are in line with the observer , and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to m 1 and m ' 2 the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector the resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured , or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded the heterodyne technique is used for ( 1 ) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as ( 2 ) amplifying a weak input signal ( assuming use of an active mixer ) the nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals , one at the sum f 1 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; f 2 of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference f 1 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; f 2 while optical heterodyne interferometry is usually done at a single point it is also possible to perform this widefield a double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths a common-path interferometer is a class of interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path & nbsp ; 4 illustrates the sagnac interferometer , the fibre optic gyroscope , the point diffraction interferometer , and the shearing interferometer other examples of common path interferometer include the zernike phase-contrast microscope , fresnel 's biprism , the zero-area sagnac , and the scatterplate interferometer other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the fresnel biprism , the billet bi-lens , and the rayleigh interferometer other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the michelson , twyman–green , laser unequal path , and linnik interferometer if it is decided to produce fringes in white light , then , since white light has a limited coherence length , on the order of micrometre , great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible the result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern this was an early example of the use of white light to resolve the '' 2 & nbsp ; pi ambiguity '' & nbsp ; 26 ) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues these include propagation-based phase contrast , talbot interferometry , moiré-based far-field interferometry , refraction-enhanced imaging , and x-ray interferometry

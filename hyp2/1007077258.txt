this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference & nbsp ; 1 , the well-known michelson configuration ) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter ( a partially reflecting mirror ) it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves if a single beam has been split along two paths , then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths 2a and 2b , the observer has a direct view of mirror m 1 seen through the beam splitter , and sees a reflected image m & prime ; 2 of mirror m 2 the fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 of the original source s & nbsp ; 2a , the optical elements are oriented so that s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 are in line with the observer , and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to m 1 and m ' 2 use of white light will result in a pattern of colored fringes ( see fig the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector the resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured , or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded a weak input signal of frequency f 1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f 2 from a local oscillator ( lo ) : optical heterodyne detection is an extension of the heterodyne technique to higher ( visible ) frequencies a double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths after being perturbed by interaction with the sample under test , the sample beam is recombined with the reference beam to create an interference pattern which can then be interpreted & nbsp ; 4 illustrates the sagnac interferometer , the fibre optic gyroscope , the point diffraction interferometer , and the shearing interferometer other examples of common path interferometer include the zernike phase-contrast microscope , fresnel 's biprism , the zero-area sagnac , and the scatterplate interferometer a wavefront splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront emerging from a point or a narrow slit ( i.e spatially coherent light ) and , after allowing the two parts of the wavefront to travel through different paths , allows them to recombine if white light is used in young 's experiment , the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits , surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the michelson , twyman–green , laser unequal path , and linnik interferometer separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other each of the well separated light paths is traversed only once , and the fringes can be adjusted so that they are localized in any desired plane the result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference & nbsp ; 24 and & nbsp ; 25 , phase contrast and dic microscopes allow unstained , living cells to be studied & nbsp ; 26 ) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues

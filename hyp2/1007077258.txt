interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave & nbsp ; 1 , the well-known michelson configuration ) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter ( a partially reflecting mirror ) it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves if a single beam has been split along two paths , then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths this could be a physical change in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path the fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 of the original source s the characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter & nbsp ; 2b , m 1 and m & prime ; 2 are tilted with respect to each other , the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections ( hyperbolas ) , but if m & prime ; 1 and m & prime ; 2 overlap , the fringes near the axis will be straight , parallel , and equally spaced if s is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated , the fringes of fig the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category the nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals , one at the sum f 1 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; f 2 of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference f 1 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; f 2 : optical heterodyne detection is an extension of the heterodyne technique to higher ( visible ) frequencies a double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths other examples of common path interferometer include the zernike phase-contrast microscope , fresnel 's biprism , the zero-area sagnac , and the scatterplate interferometer other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the fresnel biprism , the billet bi-lens , and the rayleigh interferometer if white light is used in young 's experiment , the result is a white central band of constructive interference corresponding to equal path length from the two slits , surrounded by a symmetrical pattern of colored fringes of diminishing intensity in addition to continuous electromagnetic radiation , young 's experiment has been performed with individual photons , with electrons , and with buckyball molecules large enough to be seen under an electron microscope lloyd 's mirror generates interference fringes by combining direct light from a source ( blue lines ) and light from the source 's reflected image ( red lines ) from a mirror held at grazing incidence fig & nbsp ; 6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis in this orientation , the test and reference beams each experience two front-surface reflections , resulting in the same number of phase inversions two optical resonators constructed from crystalline sapphire , controlling the frequencies of two lasers , were set at right angles within a helium cryostat toxoplasma gondii unsporulated oocyst , differential interference contrast file : phase-contrast x-ray image of spider.jpg figure 26 there are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging , all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations

interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference & nbsp ; 1 , the well-known michelson configuration ) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter ( a partially reflecting mirror ) it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves if a single beam has been split along two paths , then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths 2a and 2b , the observer has a direct view of mirror m 1 seen through the beam splitter , and sees a reflected image m & prime ; 2 of mirror m 2 the fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 of the original source s the characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter & nbsp ; 2a , the optical elements are oriented so that s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 are in line with the observer , and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to m 1 and m ' 2 if s is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated , the fringes of fig & nbsp ; 2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity , while the fringes of fig use of white light will result in a pattern of colored fringes ( see fig the central fringe representing equal path length may be light or dark depending on the number of phase inversions experienced by the two beams as they traverse the optical system the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector the heterodyne technique is used for ( 1 ) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as ( 2 ) amplifying a weak input signal ( assuming use of an active mixer ) the nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals , one at the sum f 1 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; f 2 of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference f 1 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; f 2 while optical heterodyne interferometry is usually done at a single point it is also possible to perform this widefield a double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths examples include the michelson interferometer , the twyman–green interferometer , and the mach–zehnder interferometer other examples of common path interferometer include the zernike phase-contrast microscope , fresnel 's biprism , the zero-area sagnac , and the scatterplate interferometer & nbsp ; 6 illustrates the fizeau , mach–zehnder and fabry–pérot interferometers other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the michelson , twyman–green , laser unequal path , and linnik interferometer the result is that light traveling an equal optical path length in the test and reference beams produces a white light fringe of constructive interference a frequency comparator measured the beat frequency of the combined outputs of the two resonators & nbsp ; 24 and & nbsp ; 25 , phase contrast and dic microscopes allow unstained , living cells to be studied & nbsp ; 26 ) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues these include propagation-based phase contrast , talbot interferometry , moiré-based far-field interferometry , refraction-enhanced imaging , and x-ray interferometry

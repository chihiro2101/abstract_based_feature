interferometry makes use of the principle of superposition to combine waves in a way that will cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves this works because when two waves with the same frequency combine , the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern , which can be used to determine their relative phase difference most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave & nbsp ; 1 , the well-known michelson configuration ) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be split into two identical beams by a beam splitter ( a partially reflecting mirror ) the path difference , the difference in the distance traveled by each beam , creates a phase difference between them it is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves if a single beam has been split along two paths , then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths the fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 of the original source s & nbsp ; 2a , the optical elements are oriented so that s & prime ; 1 and s & prime ; 2 are in line with the observer , and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to m 1 and m ' 2 if s is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated , the fringes of fig & nbsp ; 2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity , while the fringes of fig use of white light will result in a pattern of colored fringes ( see fig in homodyne detection , the interference occurs between two beams at the same wavelength ( or carrier frequency ) the phase difference between the two beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector the resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured , or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded a double path interferometer is one in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along divergent paths examples include the michelson interferometer , the twyman–green interferometer , and the mach–zehnder interferometer a common-path interferometer is a class of interferometer in which the reference beam and sample beam travel along the same path other examples of common path interferometer include the zernike phase-contrast microscope , fresnel 's biprism , the zero-area sagnac , and the scatterplate interferometer a wavefront splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront emerging from a point or a narrow slit ( i.e other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the fresnel biprism , the billet bi-lens , and the rayleigh interferometer if it is decided to produce fringes in white light , then , since white light has a limited coherence length , on the order of micrometre , great care must be taken to equalize the optical paths or no fringes will be visible & nbsp ; 6 , a compensating cell would be placed in the path of the reference beam to match the test cell one interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an x-y longitudinal raster pattern high resolution phase-contrast x-ray image of a spider phase contrast and differential interference contrast ( dic ) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine & nbsp ; 26 ) refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues these include propagation-based phase contrast , talbot interferometry , moiré-based far-field interferometry , refraction-enhanced imaging , and x-ray interferometry

in the study of economics and market competition , collusion takes place within an industry when rival companies cooperate for their mutual benefit collusion often takes place within an oligopoly market structure , where there are few firms and agreements have significant impacts on the entire market or industry to differentiate from a cartel , collusive agreements between parties may not be explicit ; however , the implications of cartels and collusion are the same collusion which is covert is known as tacit collusion , and is considered legal firms face a kinked demand curve if , when one firm decreases its price , other firms are expected to follow suit in order to maintain sales kinked demand potentially fosters supra-competitive prices because any one firm would receive a reduced benefit from cutting price , as opposed to the benefits accruing under neoclassical theory and certain game-theoretic models such as bertrand competition collusion is illegal in the united states , canada and most of the eu due to antitrust laws , but implicit collusion in the form of price leadership and tacit understandings still takes place cheating : there is considerable incentive to cheat on collusion agreements ; although lowering prices might trigger price wars , in the short term the defecting firm may gain considerably potential entry : new firms may enter the industry , establishing a new baseline price and eliminating collusion ( though anti-dumping laws and tariffs can prevent foreign companies entering the market )

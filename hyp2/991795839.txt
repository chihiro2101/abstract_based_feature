in the study of economics and market competition , collusion takes place within an industry when rival companies cooperate for their mutual benefit collusion often takes place within an oligopoly market structure , where there are few firms and agreements have significant impacts on the entire market or industry collusion which is covert is known as tacit collusion , and is considered legal however if all firms collude to increase prices , loss of sales will be minimized , as consumers lack alternative choices at lower prices and must decide between what is available kinked demand potentially fosters supra-competitive prices because any one firm would receive a reduced benefit from cutting price , as opposed to the benefits accruing under neoclassical theory and certain game-theoretic models such as bertrand competition collusion is illegal in the united states , canada and most of the eu due to antitrust laws , but implicit collusion in the form of price leadership and tacit understandings still takes place cost and demand differences between firms : if costs vary significantly between firms , it may be impossible to establish a price at which to fix output cheating : there is considerable incentive to cheat on collusion agreements ; although lowering prices might trigger price wars , in the short term the defecting firm may gain considerably potential entry : new firms may enter the industry , establishing a new baseline price and eliminating collusion ( though anti-dumping laws and tariffs can prevent foreign companies entering the market )

due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940 , there are few certain facts of van der weyden 's life his parents were henri de le pasture and agnes de watrélos the pasture family had earlier settled in the city of tournai where rogier 's father worked as a maître-coutelier ( knife manufacturer ) in 1426 , rogier married elisabeth , the daughter of a brussels shoemaker , jan goffaert , and his wife cathelyne van stockem before 21 october 1435 , the family settled in brussels where the two younger children were born : pieter in 1437 and jan in 1438 , who would go on to become a painter and a goldsmith respectively from the second of march 1436 onward , he held the title of 'painter to the town of brussels ' ( stadsschilder ) , a very prestigious post because brussels was at that time the most important residence of the splendid court of the dukes of burgundy on his move to brussels , rogier began using the flemish version of his name : '' rogier van der weyden '' the sources on his early life are confusing and have led to different interpretations by scholars it is known that the city council of tournai offered eight pitchers of wine in honour of a certain 'maistre rogier de le pasture ' on 17 november 1426 clarke , 44 only five years later , on the first of august 1432 , de le pasture obtained the title of a '' master '' ( maistre ) painter in general , the close stylistic link between the documented works of jacques daret and the paintings attributed to robert campin and van der weyden are the main arguments to consider rogier van der weyden as a pupil of campin at the same time , the first mention of rogier de weyden places him as the official painter of brussels it is this fact that puts de la pasture and van der weyden as one and the same painter further testimony of his philanthropy is van der weyden 's position as administrator of the hospital and charitable foundation ter kisten of the beguine convent in brussels between 1455 and 1457 the miraflores altarpiece was probably commissioned by king juan & nbsp ; ii of castile , since juan & nbsp ; ii donated it to the monastery of miraflores in 1445 no single work can be attributed with certainty to van der weyden on 15th-century documentary evidence alone lorne campbell , '' the new pictorial language of rogier van der weyden '' , in rogier van der weyden , master of passions , ed campbell & van der stock , 2009 , 32–64 the best documented is the descent from the cross in the museo del prado , madrid in his catalogue raisonné of van der weyden , the belgian art historian dirk de vos agrees with campbell about the authenticity of these three paintings dirk de vos , 232 , 291 rogier 's apprenticeship under campin instilled a number of preoccupations , most noticeably his approach to feminine beauty , which was often expressed both through the elegant form of the model herself as well as her dress the resemblance was to such an extent & nbsp ; – compare campin 's portrait of a womans similarity to rogier 's berlin portrait & nbsp ; – that campin 's works were for a period attributed to rogier 's early career van mander , who knew that rogier van der weyden resided in brussels , read vasari 's text and believed that there were two different artists with the same name , who both appear separately in his schilder-boeck of 1604 it was only in 1913 that hulin de loo indicated that these works were actually painted by rogier 's teacher robert campin '' rogier van der weyden '' he completed his deposition in 1435 , which as he had deliberately intended , made him one of the most sought after and influential artists in northern europe and is still considered his masterpiece van der weyden had also a large influence on the german painter and engraver martin schongauer whose prints were distributed all over europe from the last decades of the 15th century rogier van der weyden : 1400–1464 zum logos der kunst rogier van der weydens

due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940 , there are few certain facts of van der weyden 's life campbell ( 1998 ) , 392 rogelet de le pasture ( roger of the pasture ) was born in tournai ( in present-day belgium ) in 1399 or 1400 the pasture family had earlier settled in the city of tournai where rogier 's father worked as a maître-coutelier ( knife manufacturer ) on his move to brussels , rogier began using the flemish version of his name : '' rogier van der weyden '' the archival sources from tournai were completely destroyed during world war ii , but had been partly transcribed in the 19th and early 20th century it is known that the city council of tournai offered eight pitchers of wine in honour of a certain 'maistre rogier de le pasture ' on 17 november 1426 clarke , 44 only five years later , on the first of august 1432 , de le pasture obtained the title of a '' master '' ( maistre ) painter also jacques daret was then in his twenties and had been living and working in campin 's household for at least a decade in general , the close stylistic link between the documented works of jacques daret and the paintings attributed to robert campin and van der weyden are the main arguments to consider rogier van der weyden as a pupil of campin it is this fact that puts de la pasture and van der weyden as one and the same painter the post of city painter was created especially for van der weyden and was meant to lapse on his death whilst rogier van der weyden became increasingly wealthy , he also gave generously in alms to the poor further testimony of his philanthropy is van der weyden 's position as administrator of the hospital and charitable foundation ter kisten of the beguine convent in brussels between 1455 and 1457 and in the holy year 1450 quite possibly made a pilgrimage to rome , which brought him in contact with italian artists and patrons van der weyden died on 18 june 1464 at brussels , and was buried in the chapel of st catherine in the cathedral of st gudulphe no single work can be attributed with certainty to van der weyden on 15th-century documentary evidence alone lorne campbell , '' the new pictorial language of rogier van der weyden '' , in rogier van der weyden , master of passions , ed in his catalogue raisonné of van der weyden , the belgian art historian dirk de vos agrees with campbell about the authenticity of these three paintings both painters positioned their models within strong diagonal lines , rendered either through headdress or folds of surrounding draperies or cloth campbell ( 2004 ) , 19 châtelet illustrates how subsequent generations of art historians have conflated and confused rogier van der weyden 's identity , thereby mis-attributing works of art it was only in 1913 that hulin de loo indicated that these works were actually painted by rogier 's teacher robert campin relatively few works are attributed to van der weyden 's relatively long career , but this does not mean he was un-prolific , more that it is likely that many have been lost he is first mentioned in historical records in 1427 when , relatively late in life , he studied painting under campin during 1427–32 , and soon outshone his master and , later , even influenced him '' rogier van der weyden '' dirk de vos , 58–60 in his commissioned portraits , van der weyden typically flattered his sitters he often idealised or softened their facial features , allowing them a handsomeness or beauty , or interest or intelligence they might not have been blessed with in life rogier van der weyden : 1400–1464 rogier van der weyden

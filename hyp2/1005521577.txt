due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940 , there are few certain facts of van der weyden 's life campbell ( 1998 ) , 392 rogelet de le pasture ( roger of the pasture ) was born in tournai ( in present-day belgium ) in 1399 or 1400 his parents were henri de le pasture and agnes de watrélos in 1426 , rogier married elisabeth , the daughter of a brussels shoemaker , jan goffaert , and his wife cathelyne van stockem before 21 october 1435 , the family settled in brussels where the two younger children were born : pieter in 1437 and jan in 1438 , who would go on to become a painter and a goldsmith respectively on his move to brussels , rogier began using the flemish version of his name : '' rogier van der weyden '' the archival sources from tournai were completely destroyed during world war ii , but had been partly transcribed in the 19th and early 20th century dirk de vos , 51 his later entry into apprenticeship might be explained by the fact that during the 1420s the city of tournai was in crisis and as a result the guilds were not functioning normally the sophisticated and learned iconographical and compositional qualities of the paintings attributed to him are sometimes used as an argument in favour of this supposition the social and intellectual status of rogier in his later life surpassed that of a mere craftsman at that time in general , the close stylistic link between the documented works of jacques daret and the paintings attributed to robert campin and van der weyden are the main arguments to consider rogier van der weyden as a pupil of campin the final mention of rogier de la pasture in the financial records of tournai , on 21 october 1435 , lists him as demeurrant à brouxielles ( '' living in brussels '' ) it is this fact that puts de la pasture and van der weyden as one and the same painter the post of city painter was created especially for van der weyden and was meant to lapse on his death the portraits he painted of the burgundian dukes , their relatives and courtiers , demonstrate a close relationship with the elite of the netherlands the miraflores altarpiece was probably commissioned by king juan & nbsp ; ii of castile , since juan & nbsp ; ii donated it to the monastery of miraflores in 1445 according to some sources , in 1449 rogier went to italy , note : the 1911 edition of encyclopædia britannica has two different entries for the same person ; see below however , lorne campbell has stated that three well-authenticated paintings are known , but each has been doubted or underestimated lorne campbell , '' the new pictorial language of rogier van der weyden '' , in rogier van der weyden , master of passions , ed the resemblance was to such an extent & nbsp ; – compare campin 's portrait of a womans similarity to rogier 's berlin portrait & nbsp ; – that campin 's works were for a period attributed to rogier 's early career campbell ( 2004 ) , 19 châtelet illustrates how subsequent generations of art historians have conflated and confused rogier van der weyden 's identity , thereby mis-attributing works of art van mander , who knew that rogier van der weyden resided in brussels , read vasari 's text and believed that there were two different artists with the same name , who both appear separately in his schilder-boeck of 1604 van der weyden left no self-portraits '' rogier van der weyden '' they were destroyed in the french bombardment of brussels in 1695 , but are known from many surviving descriptions , from a free partial copy in tapestry ( bern , historisches museum ) and from other free and partial copies in drawing and painting dirk de vos , 58–60 in his commissioned portraits , van der weyden typically flattered his sitters rogier van der weyden rogier van der weyden

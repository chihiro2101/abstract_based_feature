normally the transition from a spoken to an extinct language occurs when a language undergoes language death by being directly replaced by a different one in contrast to an extinct language , which no longer has any speakers , or any written use , a historical language may remain in use as a literary or liturgical language long after it ceases to be spoken natively such languages are sometimes also referred to as '' dead languages '' , but more typically as classical languages the most prominent western example of such a language is latin , but comparable cases are found throughout world history due to the universal tendency to retain a historical stage of a language as liturgical language historical languages with living descendants that have undergone significant language change may be considered '' extinct '' , especially in cases where they did not leave a corpus of literature or liturgy that remained in widespread use ( see corpus language ) , as is the case with old english or old high german relative to their contemporary descendants , english and german some degree of misunderstanding can result from designating languages such as old english and old high german as extinct , or latin dead , while ignoring their evolution as a language this is expressed in the apparent paradox '' latin is a dead language , but latin never died '' a language such as etruscan , for example , can be said to be both extinct and dead : inscriptions are ill understood even by the most knowledgeable scholars , and the language ceased to be used in any form long ago , so that there have been no speakers , native or non-native , for many centuries in contrast , old english , old high german and latin never ceased evolving as living languages , nor did they become totally extinct as etruscan did through time latin underwent both common and divergent changes in phonology , morphology , syntax and lexicon and continues today as the native language of hundreds of millions of people , renamed as different romance languages and dialects ( french , italian , spanish , corsican , asturian , ladin , etc this last observation illustrates that for latin , old english , or old high german to be described accurately as dead or extinct , the language in question must be conceptualized as frozen in time at a particular state of its history the third and most rare outcome is for the pressured group to maintain as much of its native language as possible , while borrowing elements of the dominant language 's grammar ( replacing all , or portions of , the grammar of the original language ) language revival is the attempt to re-introduce a recently extinct language in everyday use by a new generation of native speakers the cornish language revival is an example of a major successful language revival : after a century of effort there are 3,500 claimed native speakers ; enough for unesco to change its classification from '' extinct '' to '' critically endangered '' this is a list of languages reported as having become extinct since 2010 endangered language : category : extinct languages language death language revival language teaching lists of endangered languages globalization list of modern literature translated into dead languages the dodo 's fate : how languages become extinct the foundation of endangered languages endangered languages photos of letters/characters from ancient and living languages featured on exterior walls of library of alexandria

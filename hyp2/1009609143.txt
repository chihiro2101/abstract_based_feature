normally the transition from a spoken to an extinct language occurs when a language undergoes language death by being directly replaced by a different one for example , many native american languages were replaced by english , french , portuguese , spanish or dutch as a result of colonization in contrast to an extinct language , which no longer has any speakers , or any written use , a historical language may remain in use as a literary or liturgical language long after it ceases to be spoken natively such languages are sometimes also referred to as '' dead languages '' , but more typically as classical languages the most prominent western example of such a language is latin , but comparable cases are found throughout world history due to the universal tendency to retain a historical stage of a language as liturgical language some degree of misunderstanding can result from designating languages such as old english and old high german as extinct , or latin dead , while ignoring their evolution as a language this is expressed in the apparent paradox '' latin is a dead language , but latin never died '' a language such as etruscan , for example , can be said to be both extinct and dead : inscriptions are ill understood even by the most knowledgeable scholars , and the language ceased to be used in any form long ago , so that there have been no speakers , native or non-native , for many centuries in contrast , old english , old high german and latin never ceased evolving as living languages , nor did they become totally extinct as etruscan did with regard to the written language , skills in reading or writing etruscan are all but non-existent , but trained people can understand and write old english , old high german and latin language revival is the attempt to re-introduce a recently extinct language in everyday use by a new generation of native speakers 57 & 60 in ghil'ad zuckermann 's a new vision for '' israeli hebrew '' : theoretical and practical implications of analysing israel 's main language as a semi-engineered semito-european hybrid language , journal of modern jewish studies 5 : 57â€“71 ( 2006 ) dr anna goldsworthy on the barngarla language reclamation , the monthly , september 2014 hebrew is an example of a liturgical language that has successfully been revived for everyday use the cornish language revival is an example of a major successful language revival : after a century of effort there are 3,500 claimed native speakers ; enough for unesco to change its classification from '' extinct '' to '' critically endangered '' endangered language : category : extinct languages language death language revival language teaching lists of endangered languages globalization list of modern literature translated into dead languages the languages of the andes the dodo 's fate : how languages become extinct the foundation of endangered languages endangered languages photos of letters/characters from ancient and living languages featured on exterior walls of library of alexandria

normally the transition from a spoken to an extinct language occurs when a language undergoes language death by being directly replaced by a different one for example , many native american languages were replaced by english , french , portuguese , spanish or dutch as a result of colonization in contrast to an extinct language , which no longer has any speakers , or any written use , a historical language may remain in use as a literary or liturgical language long after it ceases to be spoken natively such languages are sometimes also referred to as '' dead languages '' , but more typically as classical languages the most prominent western example of such a language is latin , but comparable cases are found throughout world history due to the universal tendency to retain a historical stage of a language as liturgical language some degree of misunderstanding can result from designating languages such as old english and old high german as extinct , or latin dead , while ignoring their evolution as a language '' a language such as etruscan , for example , can be said to be both extinct and dead : inscriptions are ill understood even by the most knowledgeable scholars , and the language ceased to be used in any form long ago , so that there have been no speakers , native or non-native , for many centuries in contrast , old english , old high german and latin never ceased evolving as living languages , nor did they become totally extinct as etruscan did this last observation illustrates that for latin , old english , or old high german to be described accurately as dead or extinct , the language in question must be conceptualized as frozen in time at a particular state of its history language contact , creolization , and genetic linguistics , university of california press ( 1991 ) p language revival is the attempt to re-introduce a recently extinct language in everyday use by a new generation of native speakers the revival of hebrew has been largely successful due to extraordinarily favourable conditions , notably the creation of a israel in which it became the official language , as well as eliezer ben-yehuda 's extreme dedication to the revival of the language , by creating new words for the modern terms hebrew lacked revival attempts for minor languages with no status as liturgical language typically have more modest results the cornish language revival is an example of a major successful language revival : after a century of effort there are 3,500 claimed native speakers ; enough for unesco to change its classification from '' extinct '' to '' critically endangered '' endangered language : category : extinct languages language death language revival language teaching lists of endangered languages globalization list of modern literature translated into dead languages ' language , 75 ( 3 ) , 486-521 the dodo 's fate : how languages become extinct the foundation of endangered languages endangered languages photos of letters/characters from ancient and living languages featured on exterior walls of library of alexandria

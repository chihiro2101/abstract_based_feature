signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma lower levels of plasma sodium are associated with more severe symptoms neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) a gradual drop , even to very low levels , may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks , because of neuronal adaptation the presence of underlying neurological disease such as a seizure disorder or non-neurological metabolic abnormalities , also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume both sodium and water content increase : increase in sodium content leads to hypervolemia and water content to hyponatremia cirrhosis of the liver congestive heart failure nephrotic syndrome in the kidneys excessive drinking of fluids hypovolemia ( extracellular volume loss ) is due to total body sodium loss hyponatremia is caused by a relatively smaller loss in total body water adh then enters the bloodstream and signals the kidney to bring back sufficient solute-free water from the fluid in the kidney tubules to dilute the serum sodium back to normal , and this turns off the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus these two act in concert to raise the serum sodium to the normal range the history , physical exam , and laboratory testing are required to determine the underlying cause of hyponatremia false hyponatremia , also known as spurious , pseudo , hypertonic , or artifactual hyponatremia is when the lab tests read low sodium levels but there is no tonicity '' hypotonic hyponatremia is categorized in 3 ways based on the person 's blood volume status chronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia in hospital it affects about 15–20 % of people , however , only 3–5 % of people who are hospitalized have a sodium level less than 130 & nbsp ; mmol/l

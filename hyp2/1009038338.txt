signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma lower levels of plasma sodium are associated with more severe symptoms neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) a gradual drop , even to very low levels , may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks , because of neuronal adaptation the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume too little sodium in the diet alone is very rarely the cause of hyponatremia both sodium and water content increase : increase in sodium content leads to hypervolemia and water content to hyponatremia there is volume expansion in the body , no edema , but hyponatremia occurs siadh ( and its many causes ) hypothyroidism not enough acth beer potomania normal physiologic change of pregnancy reset osmostat hypovolemia ( extracellular volume loss ) is due to total body sodium loss miscellaneous causes that are not included under the above classification scheme include the following : false hyponatremia ( due to massive increases in blood triglyceride levels or extreme elevation of immunoglobulins as may occur in multiple myeloma ) hyponatremia with elevated tonicity can occur with high blood sugar normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule if the feed-back system is normal , but an impairment of urine diluting ability unrelated to adh occurs , this is 1 ) oliguric kidney failure , 2 ) tubular interstitial kidney disease , 3 ) diuretics , or 4 ) nephrogenic syndrome of antidiuresis the history , physical exam , and laboratory testing are required to determine the underlying cause of hyponatremia a blood test demonstrating a serum sodium less than 135 & nbsp ; mmol/l is diagnostic for hyponatremia it occurs when using techniques that measure the amount of sodium in a specified volume of serum/plasma , or that dilute the sample before analysis chronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia there is tentative evidence that vasopressin receptor antagonists ( vaptans ) , such as conivaptan , may be slightly more effective than fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia

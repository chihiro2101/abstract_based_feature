signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma lower levels of plasma sodium are associated with more severe symptoms however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131â€“135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) as pressure increases in the skull , brain herniation can occur , which is a squeezing of the brain across the internal structures of the skull a gradual drop , even to very low levels , may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks , because of neuronal adaptation the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume both sodium and water content increase : increase in sodium content leads to hypervolemia and water content to hyponatremia there is volume expansion in the body , no edema , but hyponatremia occurs siadh ( and its many causes ) hypothyroidism not enough acth beer potomania normal physiologic change of pregnancy reset osmostat miscellaneous causes that are not included under the above classification scheme include the following : false hyponatremia ( due to massive increases in blood triglyceride levels or extreme elevation of immunoglobulins as may occur in multiple myeloma ) hyponatremia with elevated tonicity can occur with high blood sugar this system operates as follows : in some of the cells of the hypothalamus , there are osmoreceptors which respond to an elevated serum sodium in body fluids by signalling the posterior pituitary gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone ( adh ) ( vasopressin ) adh then enters the bloodstream and signals the kidney to bring back sufficient solute-free water from the fluid in the kidney tubules to dilute the serum sodium back to normal , and this turns off the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule false hyponatremia , also known as spurious , pseudo , hypertonic , or artifactual hyponatremia is when the lab tests read low sodium levels but there is no tonicity low volume hyponatremia , wherein adh secretion is stimulated by or associated with volume depletion ( not enough water in the body ) due to decreased effective circulating volume options include : mild and asymptomatic hyponatremia is treated with adequate solute intake ( including salt and protein ) and fluid restriction starting at 500 ml per day of water with adjustments based on serum sodium levels there is tentative evidence that vasopressin receptor antagonists ( vaptans ) , such as conivaptan , may be slightly more effective than fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia people who have hyponatremia who require hospitalisation have a longer length of stay ( with associated increased costs ) and also have a higher likelihood of requiring readmission

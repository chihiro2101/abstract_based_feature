signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131â€“135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) this can lead to headache , nausea , vomiting , confusion , seizures , brain stem compression and respiratory arrest , and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume there is volume expansion in the body , no edema , but hyponatremia occurs siadh ( and its many causes ) hypothyroidism not enough acth beer potomania normal physiologic change of pregnancy reset osmostat hypovolemia ( extracellular volume loss ) is due to total body sodium loss miscellaneous causes that are not included under the above classification scheme include the following : false hyponatremia ( due to massive increases in blood triglyceride levels or extreme elevation of immunoglobulins as may occur in multiple myeloma ) hyponatremia with elevated tonicity can occur with high blood sugar there is a hypothalamic-kidney feedback system which normally maintains the concentration of the serum sodium within a narrow range normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule hyponatremia occurs 1 ) when the hypothalamic-kidney feedback loop is overwhelmed by increased fluid intake , 2 ) the feedback loop malfunctions such that adh is always '' turned on '' , 3 ) the receptors in the kidney are always '' open '' regardless of there being no signal from adh to be open ; or 4 ) there is an increased adh even though there is no normal stimulus ( elevated serum sodium ) for adh to be increased true hyponatremia , also known as hypotonic hyponatremia , is the most common type normal volume hyponatremia , wherein the increase in adh is secondary to either physiologic but excessive adh release ( as occurs with nausea or severe pain ) or inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of adh , that is , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion ( siadh ) low volume hyponatremia , wherein adh secretion is stimulated by or associated with volume depletion ( not enough water in the body ) due to decreased effective circulating volume chronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate options include : mild and asymptomatic hyponatremia is treated with adequate solute intake ( including salt and protein ) and fluid restriction starting at 500 ml per day of water with adjustments based on serum sodium levels in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia they may also be used in people with chronic hyponatremia due to siadh that is insufficiently responsive to fluid restriction and/or sodium tablets

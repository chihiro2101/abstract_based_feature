signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma lower levels of plasma sodium are associated with more severe symptoms however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131–135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) the presence of underlying neurological disease such as a seizure disorder or non-neurological metabolic abnormalities , also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume both sodium and water content increase : increase in sodium content leads to hypervolemia and water content to hyponatremia there is volume expansion in the body , no edema , but hyponatremia occurs siadh ( and its many causes ) hypothyroidism not enough acth beer potomania normal physiologic change of pregnancy reset osmostat normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule hyponatremia occurs in one of two ways : either the osmoreceptor-aquaporin feedback loop is overwhelmed , or it is interrupted if the feed-back system is normal , but an impairment of urine diluting ability unrelated to adh occurs , this is 1 ) oliguric kidney failure , 2 ) tubular interstitial kidney disease , 3 ) diuretics , or 4 ) nephrogenic syndrome of antidiuresis in hypertonic hyponatremia , resorption of water by molecules such as glucose ( hyperglycemia or diabetes ) or mannitol ( hypertonic infusion ) occurs true hyponatremia , also known as hypotonic hyponatremia , is the most common type normal volume hyponatremia , wherein the increase in adh is secondary to either physiologic but excessive adh release ( as occurs with nausea or severe pain ) or inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of adh , that is , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion ( siadh ) chronic hyponatremia is when sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate severe hyponatremia or severe symptoms ( confusion , convulsions , or coma ) : consider hypertonic saline ( 3 % ) 1–2 ml/kg iv in 3–4 h in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia there is tentative evidence that vasopressin receptor antagonists ( vaptans ) , such as conivaptan , may be slightly more effective than fluid restriction in those with high volume or normal volume hyponatremia

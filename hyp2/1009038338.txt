signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea and vomiting , headache , short-term memory loss , confusion , lethargy , fatigue , loss of appetite , irritability , muscle weakness , spasms or cramps , seizures , and decreased consciousness or coma however , mild hyponatremia ( plasma sodium levels at 131â€“135 & nbsp ; mmol/l ) may be associated with complications and subtle symptoms ( for example , increased falls , altered posture and gait , reduced attention , impaired cognition , and possibly higher rates of death ) neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium ( usually when sodium levels in the blood become very low , water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell ( cerebral edema ) symptom severity depends on how fast and how severe the drop in blood sodium level is a gradual drop , even to very low levels , may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks , because of neuronal adaptation the specific causes of hyponatremia are generally divided into those with low tonicity ( lower than normal concentration of solutes ) , without low tonicity , and falsely low sodiums those with low tonicity are then grouped by whether the person has high fluid volume , normal fluid volume , or low fluid volume both sodium and water content increase : increase in sodium content leads to hypervolemia and water content to hyponatremia hypovolemia ( extracellular volume loss ) is due to total body sodium loss there is a hypothalamic-kidney feedback system which normally maintains the concentration of the serum sodium within a narrow range adh then enters the bloodstream and signals the kidney to bring back sufficient solute-free water from the fluid in the kidney tubules to dilute the serum sodium back to normal , and this turns off the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus normally , when mild hyponatremia begins to occur , that is , the serum sodium begins to fall below 135 meq/l , there is no secretion of adh , and the kidney stops returning water to the body from the kidney tubule hyponatremia occurs in one of two ways : either the osmoreceptor-aquaporin feedback loop is overwhelmed , or it is interrupted cell swelling also produces activation of volume-regulated anion channels which is related to the release of taurine and glutamate from astrocytes a blood test demonstrating a serum sodium less than 135 & nbsp ; mmol/l is diagnostic for hyponatremia false hyponatremia , also known as spurious , pseudo , hypertonic , or artifactual hyponatremia is when the lab tests read low sodium levels but there is no tonicity normal volume hyponatremia , wherein the increase in adh is secondary to either physiologic but excessive adh release ( as occurs with nausea or severe pain ) or inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of adh , that is , syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion ( siadh ) low volume hyponatremia , wherein adh secretion is stimulated by or associated with volume depletion ( not enough water in the body ) due to decreased effective circulating volume in persons with hyponatremia due to low blood volume ( hypovolemia ) from diuretics with simultaneous hypokalemia , correction of the low potassium level can assist with correction of hyponatremia

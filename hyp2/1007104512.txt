agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75 % of the world 's poor who live in rural areas encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world in addition , a recent natural resource perspective paper by the overseas development institute found that good infrastructure , education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor according to the cdc article '' h5n1 outbreaks and enzootic influenza '' by robert g : '' transmission of highly pathogenic h5n1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western china has increased the geographic spread the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines in fact , the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines webster ) in response to the same concerns , reuters reports hong kong infectious disease expert lo wing-lok indicating that vaccines have to take top priority bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , commonly known as '' mad cow disease '' , is a fatal , neurodegenerative disease of cattle , which infects by a mechanism that surprised biologists upon its discovery in the late 20th century between 460,000 and 482,000 bse-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989 a british inquiry into bse concluded that the epidemic was caused by feeding cattle , who are normally herbivores , the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal ( mbm ) , which caused the infectious agent to spread '' bse : disease control & eradication - causes of bse '' , department for environment , food , and rural affairs , march 2007 '' the bse inquiry '' , led by lord phillips of worth matravers , report published october 2000 the current scientific view is that infectious proteins called prions developed through spontaneous mutation , probably in the 1970s , and there is a possibility that the use of organophosphate increased the susceptibility of cattle to the disease the infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures it is able to survive ; this contributed to the spread of the disease in britain , which had reduced the temperatures used during its rendering process another contributory factor was the feeding of infected protein supplements to very young calves instead of milk from their mothers '' supplements used in factory farming can spread disease '' , the washington post , december 28 , 2003 north america , australia , new zealand and japan have been free of fmd for many years the clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers , standing water , and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock , and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease because fmd rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals , it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health this means that fmd vaccines must be highly specific to the strain involved although this disease is not dangerous to humans and rarely fatal to otherwise healthy animals , it reduces milk and meat production for countries with free roaming wildlife it is nearly impossible to prove that they are entirely free of this disease they are however discouraged to file a formal complaint with wto by diplomats from rich countries citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species that is caused by the bacterium xanthomonas axonopodis the infection causes lesions on the leaves , stems , and fruit of citrus trees , including lime , oranges , and grapefruit simultaneously , other diagnostic tests ( antibody detection , fatty-acid profiling , and genetic procedures using pcr ) are conducted to identify the particular canker strain in countries that do not have canker , the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures in countries with new outbreaks , eradication programs that are started soon after the disease has been discovered have been successful ; such programs rely on the destruction of affected orchards australia has had three outbreaks of citrus canker ; all three were successfully eradicated the disease was found twice during the 1900s in the northern territory and was eradicated each time during the first outbreak in 1912 , every citrus tree north of latitude 19Â° south was destroyed , taking 11 years to eradicate the disease exotic plant pests - citrus canker in 2004 , asiatic citrus canker was detected in an orchard in emerald , queensland , and was thought to have occurred from the illegal import of infected citrus plants food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce , distribute , and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies , rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system the conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product , size of the farm , nature of ownership , and country among other factors price floors or price ceilings set a minimum or maximum price for a product some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption significant dependence on foreign food producers makes a country strategically vulnerable in the event of war , blockade or embargo maintaining adequate domestic capability allows for food self-sufficiency that lessens the risk of supply shocks due to geopolitical events canada 's department of agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about 4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 reduced farm subsidies , providing fixed payments over a period and replacing price supports and subsidies the next major reform is expected for 2014 when a new long-term eu budget is coming into effect a recent oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30 % over the six years as cheap imports from the us drive down prices in the local markets

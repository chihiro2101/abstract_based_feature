agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75 % of the world 's poor who live in rural areas encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world in addition , a recent natural resource perspective paper by the overseas development institute found that good infrastructure , education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor the use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats according to the cdc article '' h5n1 outbreaks and enzootic influenza '' by robert g the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines in fact , the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines robert webster explains : '' if you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans but if they have been using vaccines now in china for several years , why is there so much bird flu ? there is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out the virus and maintaining it and changing it either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used '' ( msnbc quoting reuters quoting robert g webster ) in response to the same concerns , reuters reports hong kong infectious disease expert lo wing-lok indicating that vaccines have to take top priority there has been a lot of criticism of what they have done because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected , and then you get the drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours ' of h5n1 out there bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , commonly known as '' mad cow disease '' , is a fatal , neurodegenerative disease of cattle , which infects by a mechanism that surprised biologists upon its discovery in the late 20th century with the number expected to rise because of the disease 's long incubation period between 460,000 and 482,000 bse-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989 '' bse : disease control & eradication - causes of bse '' , department for environment , food , and rural affairs , march 2007 the current scientific view is that infectious proteins called prions developed through spontaneous mutation , probably in the 1970s , and there is a possibility that the use of organophosphate increased the susceptibility of cattle to the disease the infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures it is able to survive ; this contributed to the spread of the disease in britain , which had reduced the temperatures used during its rendering process foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs the clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers , standing water , and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock , and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease because fmd rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals , it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic , when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down therefore , rich countries maintain a policy of banning imports from all countries , not proven fmd-free by us or eu standards although this disease is not dangerous to humans and rarely fatal to otherwise healthy animals , it reduces milk and meat production in countries that do not have canker , the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures in countries with new outbreaks , eradication programs that are started soon after the disease has been discovered have been successful ; such programs rely on the destruction of affected orchards exotic plant pests - citrus canker in 2004 , asiatic citrus canker was detected in an orchard in emerald , queensland , and was thought to have occurred from the illegal import of infected citrus plants of the 6.7 billion people on the planet , about 2 billion are food insecure as the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050 , and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption , food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure climate change presents additional threats to food security , affecting crop yields , distribution of pests and diseases , weather patterns , and growing seasons around the world food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce , distribute , and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies , rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system this movement is advocated by a number of farmers , peasants , pastoralists , fisherfolk , indigenous peoples , women , rural youth , and environmental organizations the conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product , size of the farm , nature of ownership , and country among other factors some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption significant dependence on foreign food producers makes a country strategically vulnerable in the event of war , blockade or embargo agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share this may produce a net gain for a government despite the cost of interventions because it allows a country to build up an export industry or reduce imports because in almost all countries the rural poor are poorer than the urban poor , cheap food policies through price controls often increase overall poverty this position is particularly popular in competitive agricultural exporting nations in both the developed and developing world , some of whom have banded together in the cairns group lobby a developing nation could use new improved farming methods to grow more food , with the ultimate goal of feeding their nation without outside help this has led to market distortions , such as food processors using high fructose corn syrup as a replacement for sugar in april 2004 the world trade organization ( wto ) ruled that 3 billion dollars in us cotton subsidies violate trade agreements and that almost 50 % of eu sugar exports are illegal

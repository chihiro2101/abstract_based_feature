agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75 % of the world 's poor who live in rural areas encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world the use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats according to the cdc article '' h5n1 outbreaks and enzootic influenza '' by robert g : '' transmission of highly pathogenic h5n1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western china has increased the geographic spread the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines in fact , the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines but if they have been using vaccines now in china for several years , why is there so much bird flu ? there is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out the virus and maintaining it and changing it webster ) in response to the same concerns , reuters reports hong kong infectious disease expert lo wing-lok indicating that vaccines have to take top priority julie hall , who is in charge of the who 's outbreak response in china , claimed that china 's vaccinations might be masking the virus there has been a lot of criticism of what they have done because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected , and then you get the drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours ' of h5n1 out there '' ( bbc bird flu vaccine no silver bullet 22 february 2006 ) with the number expected to rise because of the disease 's long incubation period a british inquiry into bse concluded that the epidemic was caused by feeding cattle , who are normally herbivores , the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal ( mbm ) , which caused the infectious agent to spread '' bse : disease control & eradication - causes of bse '' , department for environment , food , and rural affairs , march 2007 '' the bse inquiry '' , led by lord phillips of worth matravers , report published october 2000 the infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures it is able to survive ; this contributed to the spread of the disease in britain , which had reduced the temperatures used during its rendering process fmd occurs throughout much of the world , and while some countries have been free of fmd for some time , its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern north america , australia , new zealand and japan have been free of fmd for many years most european countries have been recognized as free , and countries belonging to the european union have stopped fmd vaccination infection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally , that is , the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock the clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers , standing water , and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock , and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease because fmd rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals , it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic , when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down there is no cross-protection between serotypes ( meaning that a vaccine for one serotype wo n't protect against any others ) and in addition , two strains within a given serotype may have dna sequences that differ by as much as 30 % for a given gene because detecting and reporting of fmd have enormously improved and sped up , almost all poor countries could now safely create fmd-free export zones the result is that if drought hits , the poor try to cope by selling their few animals the export ban then destroys the value of these animals , in effect destroying the most important coping mechanism of several hundreds of millions extremely poor households citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species that is caused by the bacterium xanthomonas axonopodis while not harmful to humans , canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees , causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely ; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat but too unsightly to be sold bacteria are tested for pathogenicity by inoculating multiple citrus species with the bacterium citrus canker outbreaks are prevented and managed in a number of ways in countries that do not have canker , the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures when eradication has been unsuccessful and the disease has become established , management options include replacing susceptible citrus cultivars with resistant cultivars , applying preventive sprays of copper-based bactericides , and destroying infected trees and all surrounding trees within an appropriate radius during the first outbreak in 1912 , every citrus tree north of latitude 19Â° south was destroyed , taking 11 years to eradicate the disease as the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050 , and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption , food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change 'food sovereignty ' , a term coined by members of via campesina in 1996 , '' global small-scale farmers ' movement developing new trade regimes '' , food first news & views , volume 28 , number 97 spring/summer 2005 , p.2 advocates of food sovereignty put the people who produce , distribute , and consume food at the centre of decisions on food systems and policies , rather than the demands of markets and corporations that they believe have come to dominate the global food system because in almost all countries the rural poor are poorer than the urban poor , cheap food policies through price controls often increase overall poverty small farmers often in effect meet these demands , but are rarely able to prove that in western standards the government pays him to grow it , so he can sell it more cheaply to ghana than the farmer in ghana can the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 reduced farm subsidies , providing fixed payments over a period and replacing price supports and subsidies producers that offer the most environmental improvement based on a point system for the least cost are funded first

agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75 % of the world 's poor who live in rural areas encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world the use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats according to the cdc article '' h5n1 outbreaks and enzootic influenza '' by robert g : '' transmission of highly pathogenic h5n1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western china has increased the geographic spread in fact , the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines '' ( cdc h5n1 outbreaks and enzootic influenza by robert g robert webster explains : '' if you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans but if they have been using vaccines now in china for several years , why is there so much bird flu ? there is bad vaccine that stops the disease in the bird but the bird goes on pooping out the virus and maintaining it and changing it either there is not enough vaccine being used or there is substandard vaccine being used in the uk , the country worst affected , 179,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million were killed as a precaution '' bse : disease control & eradication - causes of bse '' , department for environment , food , and rural affairs , march 2007 the origin of the disease itself remains unknown foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs it can also infect deer , goats , sheep , and other bovids with cloven-hoof , as well as elephants , rats , and hedgehogs fmd occurs throughout much of the world , and while some countries have been free of fmd for some time , its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern cows can also catch fmd from the semen of infected bulls control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock , and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic , when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down outbreaks can be stopped quickly if farmers and transporters are forced to abide by existing rules therefore , ( besides temporary discomfort to the animals ) , any outbreak in the rich world should not be much more as a localized , cyclical economic problem for countries with free roaming wildlife it is nearly impossible to prove that they are entirely free of this disease because detecting and reporting of fmd have enormously improved and sped up , almost all poor countries could now safely create fmd-free export zones in effect , many poor tropical countries have no chance to meet current rules , so they are still today banned from exporting meat , even if many of them are fmd-free the rules around meat exports have been changed many times , always to accommodate changing circumstances in rich countries , usually further reducing meat export chances for poor countries for that reason , kanya and many other countries find the rules very unjust the infection causes lesions on the leaves , stems , and fruit of citrus trees , including lime , oranges , and grapefruit while not harmful to humans , canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees , causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely ; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat but too unsightly to be sold the disease , which is believed to have originated in south east asia , is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area , making it necessary for all citrus orchards to be destroyed for the successful eradication of the disease citrus canker outbreaks are prevented and managed in a number of ways in countries that do not have canker , the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures during the first outbreak in 1912 , every citrus tree north of latitude 19Â° south was destroyed , taking 11 years to eradicate the disease glauca ) in the vicinity of emerald be destroyed rather than trying to isolate infected trees climate change presents additional threats to food security , affecting crop yields , distribution of pests and diseases , weather patterns , and growing seasons around the world this movement is advocated by a number of farmers , peasants , pastoralists , fisherfolk , indigenous peoples , women , rural youth , and environmental organizations price floors or price ceilings set a minimum or maximum price for a product some argue that nations have an interest in assuring there is sufficient domestic production capability to meet domestic needs in the event of a global supply disruption agricultural policies may be used to support domestic producers as they gain domestic and international market share this may be a short term way of encouraging an industry until it is large enough to thrive without aid for instance , subsidies may be given for particular farming methods , forestation , land clearance , or pollution abatement this process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies alternates of cash crops , like sugar and oil replacements , can reduce farmers ' dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations about forty-nine percent of this amount was accounted for by political measures : 37 billion euros due to direct payments and 43 billion euros from consumers due to the artificially high price eighty percent of european farmers receive a direct payment of 5,000 euros or less , while 2.2 % receive a direct payment above 50,000 euros , totaling forty percent of all direct subsidies while this has diminished the distortions created by the common agricultural policy , many critics argue that a greater focus on the provision of public goods , such as biodiversity and clean water , is needed

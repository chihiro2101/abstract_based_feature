agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75 % of the world 's poor who live in rural areas encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world in addition , a recent natural resource perspective paper by the overseas development institute found that good infrastructure , education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor the use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats according to the cdc article '' h5n1 outbreaks and enzootic influenza '' by robert g : '' transmission of highly pathogenic h5n1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western china has increased the geographic spread the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines in fact , the root cause of the continuing h5n1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of h5n1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines julie hall , who is in charge of the who 's outbreak response in china , claimed that china 's vaccinations might be masking the virus wendy barclay , a virologist at the university of reading , uk said : '' the chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with h5n1 antigens , and they have been using it there has been a lot of criticism of what they have done because they have protected their chickens against death from this virus but the chickens still get infected , and then you get the drift - the virus mutates in response to the antibodies - and now we have a situation where we have five or six 'flavours ' of h5n1 out there bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , commonly known as '' mad cow disease '' , is a fatal , neurodegenerative disease of cattle , which infects by a mechanism that surprised biologists upon its discovery in the late 20th century the current scientific view is that infectious proteins called prions developed through spontaneous mutation , probably in the 1970s , and there is a possibility that the use of organophosphate increased the susceptibility of cattle to the disease the cause of bse '' , phillips inquiry , october 2000 another contributory factor was the feeding of infected protein supplements to very young calves instead of milk from their mothers '' supplements used in factory farming can spread disease '' , the washington post , december 28 , 2003 foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs it can also infect deer , goats , sheep , and other bovids with cloven-hoof , as well as elephants , rats , and hedgehogs fmd occurs throughout much of the world , and while some countries have been free of fmd for some time , its wide host range and rapid spread represent cause for international concern most european countries have been recognized as free , and countries belonging to the european union have stopped fmd vaccination infection with foot-and-mouth disease tends to occur locally , that is , the virus is passed on to susceptible animals through direct contact with infected animals or with contaminated pens or vehicles used to transport livestock the clothes and skin of animal handlers such as farmers , standing water , and uncooked food scraps and feed supplements containing infected animal products can harbor the virus as well because fmd rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals , it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health one of the difficulties in vaccinating against fmd is the huge variation between and even within serotypes vaccination only provides temporary immunity that lasts from months to years this is a point of contention although this disease is not dangerous to humans and rarely fatal to otherwise healthy animals , it reduces milk and meat production if they try they are forced to erect nationwide fences , which destroys wildlife migration in effect , many poor tropical countries have no chance to meet current rules , so they are still today banned from exporting meat , even if many of them are fmd-free the rules around meat exports have been changed many times , always to accommodate changing circumstances in rich countries , usually further reducing meat export chances for poor countries for that reason , kanya and many other countries find the rules very unjust they are however discouraged to file a formal complaint with wto by diplomats from rich countries citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species that is caused by the bacterium xanthomonas axonopodis while not harmful to humans , canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees , causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely ; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat but too unsightly to be sold the disease , which is believed to have originated in south east asia , is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area , making it necessary for all citrus orchards to be destroyed for the successful eradication of the disease simultaneously , other diagnostic tests ( antibody detection , fatty-acid profiling , and genetic procedures using pcr ) are conducted to identify the particular canker strain australia has had three outbreaks of citrus canker ; all three were successfully eradicated the state and federal governments have ordered that all commercial orchards , all non-commercial citrus trees , and all native lime trees ( c climate change presents additional threats to food security , affecting crop yields , distribution of pests and diseases , weather patterns , and growing seasons around the world food security has thus become an increasingly important topic in agricultural policy as decision makers attempt to reduce poverty and malnutrition while augmenting adaptive capacity to climate change opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations ( agribusiness ) which are hardly deserving of sympathy , and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty when rich countries subsidize domestic production , the excess output is often given to the developing world as foreign aid canada 's department of agriculture estimates that developing nations would benefit by about 4 billion annually if subsidies in the developed world were halved while this has diminished the distortions created by the common agricultural policy , many critics argue that a greater focus on the provision of public goods , such as biodiversity and clean water , is needed a recent oxfam report estimated that average household incomes of maize farmers will be reduced by as much as 30 % over the six years as cheap imports from the us drive down prices in the local markets

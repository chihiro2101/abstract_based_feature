agriculture remains the largest single contributor to the livelihoods of 75 % of the world 's poor who live in rural areas encouraging agricultural growth is therefore an important aspect of agricultural policy in the developing world in addition , a recent natural resource perspective paper by the overseas development institute found that good infrastructure , education and effective information services in rural areas were necessary to improve the chances of making agriculture work for the poor the use of animal vaccines can create new viruses that kill people and cause flu pandemic threats the spread of h5n1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines robert webster explains : '' if you use a good vaccine you can prevent the transmission within poultry and to humans webster ) in response to the same concerns , reuters reports hong kong infectious disease expert lo wing-lok indicating that vaccines have to take top priority julie hall , who is in charge of the who 's outbreak response in china , claimed that china 's vaccinations might be masking the virus wendy barclay , a virologist at the university of reading , uk said : '' the chinese have made a vaccine based on reverse genetics made with h5n1 antigens , and they have been using it in the uk , the country worst affected , 179,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million were killed as a precaution the disease can be transmitted to human beings who eat or inhale material from infected carcasses in humans , it is known as new variant creutzfeldt–jakob disease ( vcjd or nvcjd ) , and by june 2007 , it had killed 165 people in britain , and six elsewhere '' variant creutzfeldt–jakob disease , june 2007 '' , the national creutzfeldt–jakob disease surveillance unit , university of edinburgh between 460,000 and 482,000 bse-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989 a british inquiry into bse concluded that the epidemic was caused by feeding cattle , who are normally herbivores , the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal ( mbm ) , which caused the infectious agent to spread '' the bse inquiry '' , led by lord phillips of worth matravers , report published october 2000 in 1996 , endemic areas included asia , africa , and parts of south america control measures include quarantine and destruction of infected livestock , and export bans for meat and other animal products to countries not infected with the disease because fmd rarely infects humans but spreads rapidly among animals , it is a much greater threat to the agriculture industry than to human health farmers around the world can lose huge amounts of money during a foot-and-mouth epidemic , when large numbers of animals are destroyed and revenues from milk and meat production go down one of the difficulties in vaccinating against fmd is the huge variation between and even within serotypes this means that fmd vaccines must be highly specific to the strain involved therefore , rich countries maintain a policy of banning imports from all countries , not proven fmd-free by us or eu standards the rules around meat exports have been changed many times , always to accommodate changing circumstances in rich countries , usually further reducing meat export chances for poor countries the disease , which is believed to have originated in south east asia , is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area , making it necessary for all citrus orchards to be destroyed for the successful eradication of the disease in countries that do not have canker , the disease is prevented from entering the country by quarantine measures the disease was found twice during the 1900s in the northern territory and was eradicated each time exotic plant pests - citrus canker in 2004 , asiatic citrus canker was detected in an orchard in emerald , queensland , and was thought to have occurred from the illegal import of infected citrus plants the united nations food and agriculture organization ( fao ) defines food security as existing when '' all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life '' food and agriculture organization of the united nations , rome , italy the four qualifications that must be met for a food secure system include physical availability , economic and physical access , appropriate utilization , and stability of the prior three elements over time as the global population grows to 9 billion by 2050 , and as diets shift to emphasize higher energy products and greater overall consumption , food systems will be subjected to even greater pressure climate change presents additional threats to food security , affecting crop yields , distribution of pests and diseases , weather patterns , and growing seasons around the world an agricultural subsidy is a governmental subsidy paid to farmers and agribusinesses to manage the agricultural industry as one part of the various methods a government uses in a mixed economy the conditions for payment and the reasons for the individual specific subsidies vary with farm product , size of the farm , nature of ownership , and country among other factors a government can erect trade barriers to limit the number of goods imported ( in the case of a quota share ) or enact tariffs to raise the domestic price of imported products farm or undeveloped land composes the majority of land in most countries this often goes at the cost of the rural poor , who then earn less from what is often their only realistic or potential source of income : agriculture because in almost all countries the rural poor are poorer than the urban poor , cheap food policies through price controls often increase overall poverty the same often counts for poverty relief in the form of food aid , which ( unless while during severe drought ) drives small producers in poor countries out of production welfare economics theory holds that sometimes private activities can impose social costs upon others the heritage foundation ( 2004 ) the heritage foundation on the other hand , organic farming received 5 million for help in certification and 15 million for research over a 5-year time period opponents point out that most agriculture in developed nations is produced by industrial corporations ( agribusiness ) which are hardly deserving of sympathy , and that the alternative to exploitation is poverty this process eliminates the domestic market for agricultural products in the developing world because the products can be obtained for free from western aid agencies according to oxfam , '' if developed nations eliminated subsidy programs , the export value of agriculture in lesser developed nations would increase by 24 % , plus a further 5.5 % from tariff equilibrium alternates of cash crops , like sugar and oil replacements , can reduce farmers ' dependency on subsidies in both developed and developing nations

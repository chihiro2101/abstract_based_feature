ostinati are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches , as in stravinsky 's the rite of spring introduction and augurs of spring a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza this style was emulated by other bel canto composers , especially vincenzo bellini ; and later by wagner ( in pure instrumental terms , discarding the closing vocal cadenza ) applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures , they are '' repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes '' , more familiar as accompanimental melodies , or purely rhythmic '' timbre and texture in twentieth-century music '' , aspects of 20th century music , p lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional chord progressions to shape phrases and define tonality '' relentless , repetitive character help to establish and confirm the modal center '' their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use , though , '' ostinato must be employed judiciously , as its overuse can quickly lead to monotony '' ostinato patterns have been present in european music from the middle ages onwards over this , the main melodic line moves freely , varying the phrase-lengths , while being '' to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices 230 aaron copland copland , aaron and rich , alan ( 2002 ) a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part , while the upper parts proceed normally with variation '' however , he cautions , '' it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form here the ostinato ( or 'ground ' ) consists of just two notes : in italy , during the seventeenth century , claudio monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works one of these was his 1650 version of '' laetatus sum '' , an imposing setting of psalm 122 that pits a four-note '' ostinato of unquenchable energy '' stevens , d ( 1978 , p81 ) monteverdi : sacred , secular and occasional music his most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the aria '' when i am laid in earth '' ( '' dido 's lament '' ) at the end of his opera dido and aeneas : purcell 's instrumental music also featured ground patterns ostinatos feature in many works of the late 18th and early 19th centuries a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza here , the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano & nbsp ; – it is never used as a bass '' remark that the footfall ostinato remains nearly throughout on the same notes , at the same pitch level '' the rhythmical current running through the music is what binds together these curious mosaic-like pieces a subtler metrical conflict can be found in the final section of stravinsky 's symphony of psalms the choir sing a melody in triple time , while the bass instruments in the orchestra play a 4-beat ostinato against this many instruments south of the sahara desert play ostinato melodies ostinato figures are also played on string instruments such as the kora , gankoqui bell ensembles , and pitched drums ensembles other african ostinatos generate complete cross-rhythms by sounding both the main beats and cross-beats the left hand ( lower notes ) sounds the two main beats , while the right hand ( upper notes ) sounds the three cross-beats however , the foreign influences are interpreted through a distinctly african ostinato sensibility however , performers of african popular music do not perceive these progressions in the same way harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant ( as they are known in european music ) have been used in traditional sub-saharan african harmony for hundreds of years it may serve as a refrain or melody , often played by the rhythm section instruments or solo instruments that form the basis or accompaniment of a musical composition though they are most often found in rock music , heavy metal music , latin , funk and jazz , classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff , such as ravel 's boléro in jazz , fusion , and related genres , a background vamp provides a performer with a harmonic framework supporting improvisation in gospel and soul music , the band often vamps on a simple ostinato groove at the end of a song , usually over a single chord once the vamp section is over , the music continues to the next section the lehara may be interspersed with short and occasional improvisations built around the basic melody

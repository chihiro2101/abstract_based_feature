ostinati are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches , as in stravinsky 's the rite of spring introduction and augurs of spring a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures , they are '' repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes '' , more familiar as accompanimental melodies , or purely rhythmic '' timbre and texture in twentieth-century music '' , aspects of 20th century music , p lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional chord progressions to shape phrases and define tonality '' their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use , though , '' ostinato patterns have been present in european music from the middle ages onwards over this , the main melodic line moves freely , varying the phrase-lengths , while being '' to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part , while the upper parts proceed normally with variation '' however , he cautions , '' it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form '' one striking ostinato instrumental piece of the late renaissance period is '' the bells '' , a piece for virginals by william byrd here the ostinato ( or 'ground ' ) consists of just two notes : in italy , during the seventeenth century , claudio monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works one of these was his 1650 version of '' laetatus sum '' , an imposing setting of psalm 122 that pits a four-note '' ostinato of unquenchable energy '' stevens , d ( 1978 , p81 ) monteverdi : sacred , secular and occasional music against both voices and instruments : later in the same century , henry purcell became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns a particularly fine and complex example is his fantasia upon a ground for three violins and continuo : the intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the baroque period in the energetic scherzo of beethoven ’ s late c sharp minor quartet , op the '' transformation music '' that supports this change of scene is dominated by the iterated tolling of four bells : debussy featured an ostinato pattern throughout his piano prelude '' des pas sur la neige '' here , the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano & nbsp ; – it is never used as a bass '' here a rigid pattern of ( 3+2+2/4 ) bars is laid over a strictly recurring twenty-three-beat tune ( the bars being marked by a cello ostinato ) , so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme '' this is built up over an ostinato bass ( harp , two pianos and timpani ) moving in fourths like a pendulum many instruments south of the sahara desert play ostinato melodies other african ostinatos generate complete cross-rhythms by sounding both the main beats and cross-beats the left hand ( lower notes ) sounds the two main beats , while the right hand ( upper notes ) sounds the three cross-beats however , the foreign influences are interpreted through a distinctly african ostinato sensibility african guitar styles began with congolese bands doing cuban '' cover '' songs afro-cuban comes home : the birth of congo music however , performers of african popular music do not perceive these progressions in the same way harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant ( as they are known in european music ) have been used in traditional sub-saharan african harmony for hundreds of years petaluma , california : sher music '' in jazz and r & b , riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions vamps are usually harmonically sparse : a vamp may consist of a single chord or a sequence of chords played in a repeated rhythm depending upon the musician , a repeating figure in '' a night in tunisia '' could be called an ostinato , guajeo , riff , or vamp the vamp gives the onstage singers time to prepare for the song or the next verse , without requiring the music to pause the rideout is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long , though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a roxy rideout this melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle ( tala or taal ) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple ragas in indian classical music , the concept of 'sam ' ( pronounced as 'sum ' ) carries paramount importance the playing of the lehara is relatively free from the numerous rules and constraints of raga sangeet , which are upheld and honoured in the tradition of indian classical music

ostinati are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches , as in stravinsky 's the rite of spring introduction and augurs of spring a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza this style was emulated by other bel canto composers , especially vincenzo bellini ; and later by wagner ( in pure instrumental terms , discarding the closing vocal cadenza ) applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures , they are '' repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes '' , more familiar as accompanimental melodies , or purely rhythmic '' timbre and texture in twentieth-century music '' , aspects of 20th century music , p lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional chord progressions to shape phrases and define tonality '' their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use , though , '' ostinato must be employed judiciously , as its overuse can quickly lead to monotony '' ostinato patterns have been present in european music from the middle ages onwards over this , the main melodic line moves freely , varying the phrase-lengths , while being '' to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices ground bass or basso ostinato ( obstinate bass ) is a type of variation form in which a bass line , or harmonic pattern ( see chaconne ; also common in elizabethan england as grounde ) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations graduate review of tonal theory a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part , while the upper parts proceed normally with variation '' here the ostinato ( or 'ground ' ) consists of just two notes : in italy , during the seventeenth century , claudio monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works against both voices and instruments : later in the same century , henry purcell became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns his most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the aria '' when i am laid in earth '' ( '' dido 's lament '' ) at the end of his opera dido and aeneas : purcell 's instrumental music also featured ground patterns a particularly fine and complex example is his fantasia upon a ground for three violins and continuo : the intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the baroque period a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza the '' transformation music '' that supports this change of scene is dominated by the iterated tolling of four bells : here , the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano & nbsp ; – it is never used as a bass '' here a rigid pattern of ( 3+2+2/4 ) bars is laid over a strictly recurring twenty-three-beat tune ( the bars being marked by a cello ostinato ) , so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme ( 1988 , p57 ) the music of stravinsky often , african ostinatos contain offbeats or cross-beats , that contradict the metric structure the left hand ( lower notes ) sounds the two main beats , while the right hand ( upper notes ) sounds the three cross-beats the african guitar parts are drawn from a variety of sources , including the indigenous mbira , as well as foreign influences such as james brown-type funk riffs however , the foreign influences are interpreted through a distinctly african ostinato sensibility such progressions seem superficially to follow the conventions of western music theory though they are most often found in rock music , heavy metal music , latin , funk and jazz , classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff , such as ravel 's boléro riffs can be as simple as a tenor saxophone honking a simple , catchy rhythmic figure , or as complex as the riff-based variations in the head arrangements played by the count basie orchestra david brackett ( 1999 ) defines riffs as '' short melodic phrases '' , while richard middleton ( 1999 ) defines them as '' short rhythmic , melodic , or harmonic figures repeated to form a structural framework '' rikky rooksby states : '' a riff is a short , repeated , memorable musical phrase , often pitched low on the guitar , which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song '' in jazz and r & b , riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions the riff from charlie parker 's bebop number '' now 's the time '' ( 1945 ) re-emerged four years later as the r & b dance hit '' the hucklebuck '' the verse of '' the hucklebuck '' —another riff—was '' borrowed '' from the artie matthews composition '' weary blues '' the equivalent in classical music is an ostinato , in hip hop and electronic music the loop , and in rock music the riff the afro-cuban vamp style known as guajeo is used in the bebop/latin jazz standard '' a night in tunisia '' the rideout is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long , though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a roxy rideout traditional sub-saharan african harmony canto ostinato chaconne chanking fill ( music ) folia glossary of musical terminology hook ( music ) imitation ( music ) leitmotif music sequencer o fortuna passacaglia pedal point sequence ( music )

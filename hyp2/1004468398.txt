ostinati are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches , as in stravinsky 's the rite of spring introduction and augurs of spring a famous type of ostinato , called the rossini crescendo , owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern , which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures , they are '' repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes '' , more familiar as accompanimental melodies , or purely rhythmic '' timbre and texture in twentieth-century music '' , aspects of 20th century music , p their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use , though , '' ostinato patterns have been present in european music from the middle ages onwards over this , the main melodic line moves freely , varying the phrase-lengths , while being '' to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices ground bass or basso ostinato ( obstinate bass ) is a type of variation form in which a bass line , or harmonic pattern ( see chaconne ; also common in elizabethan england as grounde ) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part , while the upper parts proceed normally with variation '' however , he cautions , '' it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form '' one striking ostinato instrumental piece of the late renaissance period is '' the bells '' , a piece for virginals by william byrd here the ostinato ( or 'ground ' ) consists of just two notes : in italy , during the seventeenth century , claudio monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works one of these was his 1650 version of '' laetatus sum '' , an imposing setting of psalm 122 that pits a four-note '' ostinato of unquenchable energy against both voices and instruments : later in the same century , henry purcell became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns his most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the aria '' when i am laid in earth '' ( '' dido 's lament '' ) at the end of his opera dido and aeneas : however , this is not the only ostinato pattern that purcell uses in the opera the '' transformation music '' that supports this change of scene is dominated by the iterated tolling of four bells : here , the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano & nbsp ; – it is never used as a bass this piece is an appeal to the basic loneliness of all human beings , oft-forgotten perhaps , but , like the ostinato , forming a basic undercurrent of our history , stravinsky sets up three repeated patterns , which overlap one another and never coincide '' here a rigid pattern of ( 3+2+2/4 ) bars is laid over a strictly recurring twenty-three-beat tune ( the bars being marked by a cello ostinato ) , so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme '' the rhythmical current running through the music is what binds together these curious mosaic-like pieces many instruments south of the sahara desert play ostinato melodies ostinato figures are also played on string instruments such as the kora , gankoqui bell ensembles , and pitched drums ensembles the clave matrix ; afro-cuban rhythm : its principles and african origins pp in the following example , a gyil sounds the three-against-two cross-rhythm ( hemiola ) popular dance bands in west africa and the congo ( area ) feature ostinato-playing guitars african guitar styles began with congolese bands doing cuban '' cover '' songs gradually , various regional guitar styles emerged , as indigenous influences became increasingly dominant within these africanized guajeos afro-cuban comes home : the birth of congo music such progressions seem superficially to follow the conventions of western music theory the term guajeo is often used to mean specific ostinato patterns played by a tres , piano , an instrument of the violin family , or saxophones contemporary jazz writers also use riff- or lick-like ostinatos in modal music in music , a vamp is a repeating musical figure , section , marshall , wolf ( 2008 ) classic examples of vamps in jazz include '' a night in tunisia '' , '' take five '' , '' a love supreme '' , '' maiden voyage '' , and '' cantaloupe island '' jazz scholar barry kernfeld calls this music vamp music unlike these music genres , funk is based on the rhythmic groove of the percussion , rhythm section instruments , and a deep electric bass line , usually all over a single chord the vamp gives the onstage singers time to prepare for the song or the next verse , without requiring the music to pause the playing of the lehara is relatively free from the numerous rules and constraints of raga sangeet , which are upheld and honoured in the tradition of indian classical music

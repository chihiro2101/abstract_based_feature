the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx despite a very strong demand for the chip , amd experienced early manufacturing difficulties that made it difficult to deliver athlon 64s in quantity in the early months of the athlon 64 lifespan , amd could only produce 100,000 chips per month on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory socket 939 offered two main improvements over socket 754 : the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture , doubling peak memory bandwidth , and the hypertransport bus was increased in speed from 800 & nbsp ; mhz to 1000 & nbsp ; mhz venice , the lower-end part , was produced for both sockets 754 and 939 , and included 512 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache san diego , the higher-end chip , was produced only for socket 939 and doubled venice 's l2 cache to 1 & nbsp ; mb both also included support for the sse3 instruction set , a new feature that had been included in the rival pentium 4 since the release of the prescott core in february 2004 in addition , amd overhauled the memory controller for this revision , resulting in performance improvements as well as support for newer ddr ram on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 some felt initially that the x2 would cause market confusion with regard to price points since the new processor was targeted at the same '' enthusiast , '' us 350 and above market already occupied by amd 's existing socket 939 athlon 64s the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers the athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for ddr2 sdram , an emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by intel amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 the athlon 64 fx-62 was also released concurrently on the socket am2 platform the athlon architecture was further extended with the release of athlon neo processors on january 9 , 2009 when the user is running undemanding applications and the load on the processor is light , the processor 's clock speed and voltage are reduced the athlon 64 fx is positioned as a hardware enthusiast product , marketed by amd especially toward gamers unlike the standard athlon 64 , all of the athlon 64 fx processors have their multipliers completely unlocked from fx-70 onwards , the line of processors will also support dual-processor setup with numa , named amd quad fx platform in 2007 , amd released two final athlon 64 x2 versions : the amd athlon 64 x2 6400+ and 5000+ black editions thumb thumb previously introduced as '' mobile athlon 64 '' , turion 64 is now the brand name amd applies to its 64-bit low-power consumption ( mobile ) processors athlon x2 dual core processor l310 athlon x2 dual core processor l335 jim keller 64-bit list of amd athlon 64 microprocessors list of amd sempron microprocessors list of amd turion microprocessors

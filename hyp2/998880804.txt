the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd , and was referred to as such internally and in press releases the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx in the early months of the athlon 64 lifespan , amd could only produce 100,000 chips per month on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory socket 939 offered two main improvements over socket 754 : the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture , doubling peak memory bandwidth , and the hypertransport bus was increased in speed from 800 & nbsp ; mhz to 1000 & nbsp ; mhz both also included support for the sse3 instruction set , a new feature that had been included in the rival pentium 4 since the release of the prescott core in february 2004 in addition , amd overhauled the memory controller for this revision , resulting in performance improvements as well as support for newer ddr ram on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 released on may 31 , 2005 , it also initially had two different core revisions available to the public , manchester and toledo , the only appreciable difference between them being the amount of l2 cache the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers the athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for ddr2 sdram , an emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by intel amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 '' windsor '' , an athlon 64 x2 revision for socket am2 , was released concurrently the athlon 64 fx-62 was also released concurrently on the socket am2 platform the athlon architecture was further extended with the release of athlon neo processors on january 9 , 2009 based on the same architecture as the other athlon 64 variants , the new processor features a small package footprint targeting subnotebook market the athlon 64 cpus have been produced with 130 & nbsp ; nm and 90 & nbsp ; nm soi process technologies in 2007 , amd released two final athlon 64 x2 versions : the amd athlon 64 x2 6400+ and 5000+ black editions the 6400+ is based on a 90 & nbsp ; nm windsor core ( 3.2 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x1mb l2 , 125w tdp ) while the 5000+ is based on a 65 & nbsp ; nm brisbane core ( 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x512kb l2 , 65w tdp ) the turion 64 and turion 64 x2 processors compete with intel 's mobile processors , initially the pentium m and later the intel core and intel core 2 processors earlier turion 64 processors are compatible with amd 's socket 754 the athlon neo processors are equipped with 512 kb of l2 cache and hypertransport 1.0 running at 800 & nbsp ; mhz frequency while socket f opterons already allowed for four processor cores , quad fx allowed unbuffered ram and expanded cpu/chipset configuration in the bios athlon x2 dual core processor l335 the athlon 64 was succeeded by the k10 architecture in 2007 , including but not limited to the phenom and phenom ii processors

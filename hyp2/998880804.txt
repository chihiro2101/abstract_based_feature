the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx in the early months of the athlon 64 lifespan , amd could only produce 100,000 chips per month socket 939 offered two main improvements over socket 754 : the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture , doubling peak memory bandwidth , and the hypertransport bus was increased in speed from 800 & nbsp ; mhz to 1000 & nbsp ; mhz socket 939 also was introduced in the fx series in the form of the fx-55 at the same time , amd also began to ship the '' winchester '' core , based on a 90 nanometer process venice , the lower-end part , was produced for both sockets 754 and 939 , and included 512 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache san diego , the higher-end chip , was produced only for socket 939 and doubled venice 's l2 cache to 1 & nbsp ; mb both also included support for the sse3 instruction set , a new feature that had been included in the rival pentium 4 since the release of the prescott core in february 2004 in addition , amd overhauled the memory controller for this revision , resulting in performance improvements as well as support for newer ddr ram on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers the athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for ddr2 sdram , an emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by intel amd 's official position was that the cas latency on ddr2 had not progressed to a point where it would be advantageous for the consumer to adopt it amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 in simpler terms , the memory is always running at a set fraction of the cpu speed , with the divisor being a whole number it was also useful in building multi-processor systems without additional glue chips the athlon 64 cpus have been produced with 130 & nbsp ; nm and 90 & nbsp ; nm soi process technologies the athlon 64 fx is positioned as a hardware enthusiast product , marketed by amd especially toward gamers the 6400+ is based on a 90 & nbsp ; nm windsor core ( 3.2 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x1mb l2 , 125w tdp ) while the 5000+ is based on a 65 & nbsp ; nm brisbane core ( 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x512kb l2 , 65w tdp ) the turion 64 and turion 64 x2 processors compete with intel 's mobile processors , initially the pentium m and later the intel core and intel core 2 processors they are equipped with 512 or 1024 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache , a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller , and an 800 & nbsp ; mhz hypertransport bus the athlon neo processors are equipped with 512 kb of l2 cache and hypertransport 1.0 running at 800 & nbsp ; mhz frequency in november 2006 , amd released a specialized version of socket f , called 1207 fx , for dual-socket , dual-core athlon fx processors on the quad fx platform venice ( 90 & nbsp ; nm soi ) these successors feature higher core counts per cpu , and implement hypertransport 3.0 and socket am2+/am3

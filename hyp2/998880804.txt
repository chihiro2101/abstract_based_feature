the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd , and was referred to as such internally and in press releases the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer both cores , produced on a 130 nanometer process , were first introduced on september 23 , 2003 the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx in the early months of the athlon 64 lifespan , amd could only produce 100,000 chips per month however , it was very competitive in terms of performance to the pentium 4 , with magazine pc world calling it the '' fastest yet '' all the 64-bit processors sold by amd so far have their genesis in the k8 or hammer project on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory san diego , the higher-end chip , was produced only for socket 939 and doubled venice 's l2 cache to 1 & nbsp ; mb in addition , amd overhauled the memory controller for this revision , resulting in performance improvements as well as support for newer ddr ram on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 the athlon 64 x2 was received very well by reviewers and the general public , with a general consensus emerging that amd 's implementation of multi-core was superior to that of the competing pentium d amd 's official breakdown of the chips placed the athlon x2 aimed at a segment they called the '' prosumer '' , along with digital media fans the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers the sempron budget processor was targeted at value-conscious consumers the athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for ddr2 sdram , an emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by intel '' windsor '' , an athlon 64 x2 revision for socket am2 , was released concurrently the athlon 64 fx-62 was also released concurrently on the socket am2 platform the athlon architecture was further extended with the release of athlon neo processors on january 9 , 2009 a second bus , the northbridge , connected the cpu to the chipset and device attachment bus ( pcie , agp , pci ) with prior amd cpus a cpu shim could be used by people worried about damaging the die the athlon 64 fx is positioned as a hardware enthusiast product , marketed by amd especially toward gamers unlike the standard athlon 64 , all of the athlon 64 fx processors have their multipliers completely unlocked in 2007 , amd released two final athlon 64 x2 versions : the amd athlon 64 x2 6400+ and 5000+ black editions the turion 64 and turion 64 x2 processors compete with intel 's mobile processors , initially the pentium m and later the intel core and intel core 2 processors athlon x2 dual core processor l310 athlon x2 dual core processor l335

the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd , and was referred to as such internally and in press releases the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx despite a very strong demand for the chip , amd experienced early manufacturing difficulties that made it difficult to deliver athlon 64s in quantity on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory socket 939 offered two main improvements over socket 754 : the memory controller was altered with dual-channel architecture , doubling peak memory bandwidth , and the hypertransport bus was increased in speed from 800 & nbsp ; mhz to 1000 & nbsp ; mhz at the same time , amd also began to ship the '' winchester '' core , based on a 90 nanometer process san diego , the higher-end chip , was produced only for socket 939 and doubled venice 's l2 cache to 1 & nbsp ; mb both also included support for the sse3 instruction set , a new feature that had been included in the rival pentium 4 since the release of the prescott core in february 2004 on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 amd 's official breakdown of the chips placed the athlon x2 aimed at a segment they called the '' prosumer '' , along with digital media fans the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers amd 's official position was that the cas latency on ddr2 had not progressed to a point where it would be advantageous for the consumer to adopt it amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 '' windsor '' , an athlon 64 x2 revision for socket am2 , was released concurrently both orleans and windsor have either 512 kb or 1 mb of l2 cache per core the athlon architecture was further extended with the release of athlon neo processors on january 9 , 2009 based on the same architecture as the other athlon 64 variants , the new processor features a small package footprint targeting subnotebook market this and other architectural enhancements , especially as regards sse implementation , improve instruction per cycle ( ipc ) performance over the previous athlon xp generation when the user is running undemanding applications and the load on the processor is light , the processor 's clock speed and voltage are reduced the athlon 64 cpus have been produced with 130 & nbsp ; nm and 90 & nbsp ; nm soi process technologies the athlon 64 x2 is the first dual-core desktop cpu manufactured by amd the 6400+ is based on a 90 & nbsp ; nm windsor core ( 3.2 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x1mb l2 , 125w tdp ) while the 5000+ is based on a 65 & nbsp ; nm brisbane core ( 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz , 2x512kb l2 , 65w tdp ) they are equipped with 512 or 1024 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache , a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller , and an 800 & nbsp ; mhz hypertransport bus the clock of the processors is significantly lower than desktop and other mobile counterparts to reach a low tdp , at 15w maximum for a single core x86-64 cpu at 1.6 & nbsp ; ghz athlon x2 dual core processor l335 turion neo x2 dual core processor l625

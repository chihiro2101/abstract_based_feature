the athlon 64 was originally codenamed clawhammer by amd , and was referred to as such internally and in press releases the first athlon 64 fx was based on the first opteron core , sledgehammer the models first available were the fx-51 , fitting socket 940 , and the 3200+ , fitting socket 754 like the opteron , on which it was based , the athlon fx-51 required buffered ram , increasing the final cost of an upgrade the week of the athlon 64 's launch , intel released the pentium 4 extreme edition , a cpu designed to compete with the athlon 64 fx in the early months of the athlon 64 lifespan , amd could only produce 100,000 chips per month on june 1 , 2004 , amd released new versions of both the clawhammer and newcastle core revisions for the newly introduced socket 939 , an altered socket 940 without the need for buffered memory socket 939 also was introduced in the fx series in the form of the fx-55 san diego , the higher-end chip , was produced only for socket 939 and doubled venice 's l2 cache to 1 & nbsp ; mb both also included support for the sse3 instruction set , a new feature that had been included in the rival pentium 4 since the release of the prescott core in february 2004 on april 21 , 2005 , less than a week after the release of venice and san diego , amd announced its next addition to the athlon 64 line , the athlon 64 x2 the athlon 64 x2 was received very well by reviewers and the general public , with a general consensus emerging that amd 's implementation of multi-core was superior to that of the competing pentium d amd 's official breakdown of the chips placed the athlon x2 aimed at a segment they called the '' prosumer '' , along with digital media fans the athlon 64 was targeted at the mainstream consumer , and the athlon fx at gamers the athlon 64 had been maligned by some critics for some time because of its lack of support for ddr2 sdram , an emerging technology that had been adopted much earlier by intel amd finally remedied this gap with the '' orleans '' core revision , the first athlon 64 to fit socket am2 , released on may 23 , 2006 the athlon 64 fx-62 was also released concurrently on the socket am2 platform the athlon architecture was further extended with the release of athlon neo processors on january 9 , 2009 in simpler terms , the memory is always running at a set fraction of the cpu speed , with the divisor being a whole number it was also useful in building multi-processor systems without additional glue chips the athlon 64 cpus have been produced with 130 & nbsp ; nm and 90 & nbsp ; nm soi process technologies all of the latest chips ( winchester , venice and san diego models ) are on 90 & nbsp ; nm starting with the fx-60 , the fx line became dual-core the fx always has the highest clock speed of all athlons at its release the athlon 64 x2 is the first dual-core desktop cpu manufactured by amd they are equipped with 512 or 1024 & nbsp ; kb of l2 cache , a 64-bit single channel on-die memory controller , and an 800 & nbsp ; mhz hypertransport bus in august 2006 , amd released socket f for opteron server cpu which uses the lga chip form factor athlon x2 dual core processor l310

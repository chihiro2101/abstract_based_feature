the swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish , although in a few primitive species , there is only a single sac the walls of the bladder contain very few blood vessels and are lined with guanine crystals , which make them impermeable to gases by adjusting the gas pressurising organ using the gas gland or oval window the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in early life stages , these fish must rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders ; in later stages , the pneumatic duct disappears , and the gas gland has to introduce gas ( usually oxygen ) to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy in order to introduce gas into the bladder , the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide the resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen ( root effect ) which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars elsewhere , at a similar structure known as the oval window , the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again together with oxygen , other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well for instance , the eel synaphobranchus has been observed to have 75.1 % oxygen , 20.5 % nitrogen , 3.1 % carbon dioxide , and 0.4 % argon in its swim bladder physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage : they prohibit fast rising , as the bladder would burst the swim bladder in some species , mainly fresh water fishes ( common carp , catfish , bowfin ) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure , lungfish , gar , and bichir ) and into the swim bladders of the ray-finned fish this can be calculated by knowing a number of properties of the fish , notably the volume of the swim bladder , although the well-accepted method for doing so requires correction factors for gas-bearing zooplankton where the radius of the swim bladder is less than about 0.05 m the swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up , and , given the high pressures in the mesoplegic zone , this requires significant energy swim bladder disease is a common ailment in aquarium fish file : melaka-mall-fish-maw-kiosk-2267.jpg swim bladder display in a malacca shopping mall file : fish maw soup.jpg fish maw soup file : goldfish with swim bladder disease.jpg swim bladder disease has resulted in this female ryukin goldfish floating upside down

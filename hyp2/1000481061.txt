the swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish , although in a few primitive species , there is only a single sac by adjusting the gas pressurising organ using the gas gland or oval window the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in order to introduce gas into the bladder , the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide the resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen ( root effect ) which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars elsewhere , at a similar structure known as the oval window , the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again together with oxygen , other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well in shallow water fish , the ratios closely approximate that of the atmosphere , while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen for instance , the eel synaphobranchus has been observed to have 75.1 % oxygen , 20.5 % nitrogen , 3.1 % carbon dioxide , and 0.4 % argon in its swim bladder physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage : they prohibit fast rising , as the bladder would burst in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure in embryonal development , both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut ; in the case of swim bladders , this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more '' primitive '' ray-finned fish , and is lost in some of the more derived teleost orders the swim bladder of a fish can strongly reflect sound of an appropriate frequency strong reflection happens if the frequency is tuned to the volume resonance of the swim bladder this can be calculated by knowing a number of properties of the fish , notably the volume of the swim bladder , although the well-accepted method for doing so requires correction factors for gas-bearing zooplankton where the radius of the swim bladder is less than about 0.05 m the swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up , and , given the high pressures in the mesoplegic zone , this requires significant energy swim bladder disease is a common ailment in aquarium fish siphonophores have a special swim bladder that allows the jellyfish-like colonies to float along the surface of the water while their tentacles trail below

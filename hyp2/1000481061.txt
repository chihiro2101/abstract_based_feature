the swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish , although in a few primitive species , there is only a single sac by adjusting the gas pressurising organ using the gas gland or oval window the fish can obtain neutral buoyancy and ascend and descend to a large range of depths in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in early life stages , these fish must rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders ; in later stages , the pneumatic duct disappears , and the gas gland has to introduce gas ( usually oxygen ) to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy the resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen ( root effect ) which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars elsewhere , at a similar structure known as the oval window , the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again the swim bladder in some species , mainly fresh water fishes ( common carp , catfish , bowfin ) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish the swim bladder can radiate the pressure of sound which help increase its sensitivity and expand its hearing in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure , sharks and rays ) split from the other fishes about 420 million years ago , and lack both lungs and swim bladders , suggesting that these structures evolved after that split correspondingly , these fish also have both protocercal and stiff , wing-like pectoral fins which provide the necessary lift needed due to the lack of swim bladders teleost fish with swim bladders have neutral buoyancy , and have no need for this lift the swim bladder of a fish can strongly reflect sound of an appropriate frequency this can be calculated by knowing a number of properties of the fish , notably the volume of the swim bladder , although the well-accepted method for doing so requires correction factors for gas-bearing zooplankton where the radius of the swim bladder is less than about 0.05 m sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders , giving the appearance of a false bottom a fish with swim bladder disorder can float nose down tail up , or can float to the top or sink to the bottom of the aquarium many anthropogenic activities like pile driving or even seismic waves can create high-intensity sound waves that cause a certain amount of damage to fish that possess a gas bladder siphonophores have a special swim bladder that allows the jellyfish-like colonies to float along the surface of the water while their tentacles trail below

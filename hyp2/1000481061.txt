the swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish , although in a few primitive species , there is only a single sac the walls of the bladder contain very few blood vessels and are lined with guanine crystals , which make them impermeable to gases in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in order to introduce gas into the bladder , the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide the resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen ( root effect ) which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder the blood flowing back to the body first enters a rete mirabile where virtually all the excess carbon dioxide and oxygen produced in the gas gland diffuses back to the arteries supplying the gas gland thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars together with oxygen , other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well in shallow water fish , the ratios closely approximate that of the atmosphere , while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen for instance , the eel synaphobranchus has been observed to have 75.1 % oxygen , 20.5 % nitrogen , 3.1 % carbon dioxide , and 0.4 % argon in its swim bladder physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage : they prohibit fast rising , as the bladder would burst the swim bladder in some species , mainly fresh water fishes ( common carp , catfish , bowfin ) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish the swim bladder can radiate the pressure of sound which help increase its sensitivity and expand its hearing in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure correspondingly , these fish also have both protocercal and stiff , wing-like pectoral fins which provide the necessary lift needed due to the lack of swim bladders the swim bladder of a fish can strongly reflect sound of an appropriate frequency these vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances , and are undertaken with the assistance of a swim bladder a fish with swim bladder disorder can float nose down tail up , or can float to the top or sink to the bottom of the aquarium file : melaka-mall-fish-maw-kiosk-2267.jpg swim bladder display in a malacca shopping mall file : fish maw soup.jpg fish maw soup file : goldfish with swim bladder disease.jpg swim bladder disease has resulted in this female ryukin goldfish floating upside down

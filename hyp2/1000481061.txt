the swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish , although in a few primitive species , there is only a single sac the walls of the bladder contain very few blood vessels and are lined with guanine crystals , which make them impermeable to gases in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in early life stages , these fish must rise to the surface to fill up their swim bladders ; in later stages , the pneumatic duct disappears , and the gas gland has to introduce gas ( usually oxygen ) to the bladder to increase its volume and thus increase buoyancy in order to introduce gas into the bladder , the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars together with oxygen , other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well in shallow water fish , the ratios closely approximate that of the atmosphere , while deep sea fish tend to have higher percentages of oxygen physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage : they prohibit fast rising , as the bladder would burst the swim bladder in some species , mainly fresh water fishes ( common carp , catfish , bowfin ) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure , lungfish , gar , and bichir ) and into the swim bladders of the ray-finned fish in embryonal development , both lung and swim bladder originate as an outpocketing from the gut ; in the case of swim bladders , this connection to the gut continues to exist as the pneumatic duct in the more '' primitive '' ray-finned fish , and is lost in some of the more derived teleost orders correspondingly , these fish also have both protocercal and stiff , wing-like pectoral fins which provide the necessary lift needed due to the lack of swim bladders teleost fish with swim bladders have neutral buoyancy , and have no need for this lift some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline , where the temperature changes between 10 and 20 & nbsp ; Â°c , thus displaying considerable tolerance for temperature change in some asian cultures , the swim bladders of certain large fishes are considered a food delicacy swim bladder disease is a common ailment in aquarium fish file : melaka-mall-fish-maw-kiosk-2267.jpg swim bladder display in a malacca shopping mall file : fish maw soup.jpg fish maw soup file : goldfish with swim bladder disease.jpg swim bladder disease has resulted in this female ryukin goldfish floating upside down

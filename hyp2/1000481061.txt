the swim bladder normally consists of two gas-filled sacs located in the dorsal portion of the fish , although in a few primitive species , there is only a single sac the walls of the bladder contain very few blood vessels and are lined with guanine crystals , which make them impermeable to gases due to the dorsal position it gives the fish lateral stability in physostome swim bladders , a connection is retained between the swim bladder and the gut , the pneumatic duct , allowing the fish to fill up the swim bladder by '' gulping '' air in order to introduce gas into the bladder , the gas gland excretes lactic acid and produces carbon dioxide the resulting acidity causes the hemoglobin of the blood to lose its oxygen ( root effect ) which then diffuses partly into the swim bladder thus a very high gas pressure of oxygen can be obtained , which can even account for the presence of gas in the swim bladders of deep sea fish like the eel , requiring a pressure of hundreds of bars elsewhere , at a similar structure known as the oval window , the bladder is in contact with blood and the oxygen can diffuse back out again together with oxygen , other gases are salted out in the swim bladder which accounts for the high pressures of other gases as well for instance , the eel synaphobranchus has been observed to have 75.1 % oxygen , 20.5 % nitrogen , 3.1 % carbon dioxide , and 0.4 % argon in its swim bladder physoclist swim bladders have one important disadvantage : they prohibit fast rising , as the bladder would burst the swim bladder in some species , mainly fresh water fishes ( common carp , catfish , bowfin ) is interconnected with the inner ear of the fish the swim bladder can radiate the pressure of sound which help increase its sensitivity and expand its hearing in some deep sea fishes like the antimora , the swim bladder maybe also connected to the macula of saccule in order for the inner ear to receive a sensation from the sound pressure there are no animals which have both lungs and a swim bladder , sharks and rays ) split from the other fishes about 420 million years ago , and lack both lungs and swim bladders , suggesting that these structures evolved after that split the swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up , and , given the high pressures in the mesoplegic zone , this requires significant energy swim bladder disease is a common ailment in aquarium fish some of the commonly seen injuries included ruptured gas bladder and renal haemorrhage

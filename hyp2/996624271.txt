like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' the galactic map is the equivalent of the earlier star treks long range scan on the higher difficulty levels , hyperwarp has a skill element ; the player has to keep a wandering cross hair roughly centered during the sequence in order to arrive precisely at the desired destination right to the star trek formula , the game added real-time 3d battles as a space combat simulator in the main first-person display , the player can look out of the ship and shoot '' photons '' at zylon ships , which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from star wars , star trek , and battlestar galactica ( whose villains were the similarly titled cylons ) any collision when shields are down destroys the ship and ends the game the player has to manage finite energy reserves as well as damage to the ship ; it can be repaired and restocked by rendezvous with a friendly starbase wanting to make an action-oriented star trek-type game , doug neubauer designed star raiders in about eight to ten months while working for atari star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles the radar display in the lower right of screen is drawn using the background graphics , and updated less frequently than the sprites since the 6502 processor in the atari 8-bit family does not have a native multiply or divide command , the game slows down considerably when several of these particles are active the atari 8-bit family allows different graphics modes and color palettes to be used in different horizontal bands on the screen , by using a simple display list and a type of horizontal blank interrupt the entire game , code and data , fits into 8k ( 8192 bytes ) of rom , and requires only 8k of ram for its working data and display visuals ; thus it can run on any atari 8-bit computer versions of star raiders were created for the atari 2600 , atari 5200 , and atari st series of computers the addison-wesley book of atari software 1984 gave it an overall a rating , praising the realistic graphics and sound the book concluded that '' the game is simply great '' and that despite imitations , '' star raiders remains the classic '' the library of congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list , including star raiders neubauer 's own solaris , for the atari 2600 , is both similar and in some ways more sophisticated than his earlier game , despite the difference in technology between the two systems star raiders inspired later space combat games like elite , the wing commander series and battlesphere it was written by former 8-bit game programmer tom hudson , who was at one time a technical editor for atari hobbyist magazine analog computing star raiders ( version 25.1/stardate '' 26-jul-79 '' ) on github.com/xionyc

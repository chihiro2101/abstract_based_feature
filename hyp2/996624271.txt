like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' the galactic map is the equivalent of the earlier star treks long range scan right to the star trek formula , the game added real-time 3d battles as a space combat simulator there is also a '' long-range scan '' screen showing the surrounding region in a third-person overhead view centered on your ship , operating like a long-range radar display the game has four difficulty levels ; on all but the lowest '' novice '' level players must steer the ship into hyperspace and collisions with random meteoroids and enemy fire can cause damage to the player 's ship all this lends star raiders a degree of complexity and a sense of player immersion that was rare in action games of the era in contrast to many games of the era , the player can actually win the game by destroying all enemy ships in the galaxy wanting to make an action-oriented star trek-type game , doug neubauer designed star raiders in about eight to ten months while working for atari star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles enemy ships , shots , and most other moving objects use atari 's variant of hardware sprites , known as player-missile graphics , which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode since the 6502 processor in the atari 8-bit family does not have a native multiply or divide command , the game slows down considerably when several of these particles are active versions of star raiders were created for the atari 2600 , atari 5200 , and atari st series of computers although the controller was designed to accept overlays for compatibility with multiple games , star raiders was the only game to utilize it byte wrote in 1981 that it was the atari 's killer app : '' what can you say about a game that takes your breath away ? there are not enough superlatives to describe star raiders has enticed many people into buying apple ii computers , i 'm sure that the star raiders cartridge has sold its share of atari 400 and 800 computers '' in 1983 the magazine 's readers named it '' the most popular atari program ever '' , with 65 % more weighted votes than second-place jawbreaker , and in 1984 they named the game the most popular atari program of all time in 2004 , the atari 8-bit version of star raiders was inducted into gamespot 's list of the greatest games of all time wilmunder mentioned he had been part of a team working on 8-bit computer games and decided to make a sequel to star raiders neubauer 's own solaris , for the atari 2600 , is both similar and in some ways more sophisticated than his earlier game , despite the difference in technology between the two systems early production copies of the atari 2600 version of the game were accompanied by an atari force mini-comic ( published by dc comics )

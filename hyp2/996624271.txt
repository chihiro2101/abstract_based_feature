like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' on the higher difficulty levels , hyperwarp has a skill element ; the player has to keep a wandering cross hair roughly centered during the sequence in order to arrive precisely at the desired destination right to the star trek formula , the game added real-time 3d battles as a space combat simulator in the main first-person display , the player can look out of the ship and shoot '' photons '' at zylon ships , which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from star wars , star trek , and battlestar galactica ( whose villains were the similarly titled cylons ) there is also a '' long-range scan '' screen showing the surrounding region in a third-person overhead view centered on your ship , operating like a long-range radar display the patrol ships , which do not fire until fired upon , loosely resemble the front-on view of a cylon raider or klingon battlecruiser the game has four difficulty levels ; on all but the lowest '' novice '' level players must steer the ship into hyperspace and collisions with random meteoroids and enemy fire can cause damage to the player 's ship the enemy can also destroy a starbase if allowed to surround its galactic chart sector for too long , so the starbases have to be defended all this lends star raiders a degree of complexity and a sense of player immersion that was rare in action games of the era wanting to make an action-oriented star trek-type game , doug neubauer designed star raiders in about eight to ten months while working for atari he left the company while the game was still a prototype to return home to oregon and join hewlett-packard , and reported that it took him six months to reach the highest player-level during development star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles enemy ships , shots , and most other moving objects use atari 's variant of hardware sprites , known as player-missile graphics , which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode the atari 8-bit family allows different graphics modes and color palettes to be used in different horizontal bands on the screen , by using a simple display list and a type of horizontal blank interrupt while other games make more extensive use of these techniques , star raiders uses them in a relatively simple fashion to combine text displays and graphics ; the cockpit display uses a custom character set to display futuristic-looking characters and symbols reminiscent of micr it shipped with a special keypad controller , the video touch pad , to take the place of the computer keyboard although the controller was designed to accept overlays for compatibility with multiple games , star raiders was the only game to utilize it in 1983 the magazine 's readers named it '' the most popular atari program ever '' , with 65 % more weighted votes than second-place jawbreaker , and in 1984 they named the game the most popular atari program of all time in 2004 , the atari 8-bit version of star raiders was inducted into gamespot 's list of the greatest games of all time this version of star raiders ii is faithful to the original gameplay , but designed to make use of new 32 & nbsp ; kb cartridges early production copies of the atari 2600 version of the game were accompanied by an atari force mini-comic ( published by dc comics )

like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' the galactic map is the equivalent of the earlier star treks long range scan right to the star trek formula , the game added real-time 3d battles as a space combat simulator in the main first-person display , the player can look out of the ship and shoot '' photons '' at zylon ships , which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from star wars , star trek , and battlestar galactica ( whose villains were the similarly titled cylons ) such damage includes malfunctioning or nonfunctional shields , engines , weapons or information displays the enemy can also destroy a starbase if allowed to surround its galactic chart sector for too long , so the starbases have to be defended in contrast to many games of the era , the player can actually win the game by destroying all enemy ships in the galaxy wanting to make an action-oriented star trek-type game , doug neubauer designed star raiders in about eight to ten months while working for atari star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles the primary playfield/star field is drawn in the graphics mode that provides 160Ã—96 bitmapped pixels utilizing four color registers at a time out of a palette of 128 colors provided by the ctia chip in the early atari computers the atari 's use of an indirect palette means that color changes associated with the presence or absence of energy shields , emergency alarms , and the screen flash representing destruction of the ship can be accomplished by simply changing the palette values in memory registers enemy ships , shots , and most other moving objects use atari 's variant of hardware sprites , known as player-missile graphics , which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode while other games make more extensive use of these techniques , star raiders uses them in a relatively simple fashion to combine text displays and graphics ; the cockpit display uses a custom character set to display futuristic-looking characters and symbols reminiscent of micr versions of star raiders were created for the atari 2600 , atari 5200 , and atari st series of computers the atari st version was designed and programmed by robert zdybel with graphics and animation by jerome domurat and released by atari corporation in 1986 byte wrote in 1981 that it was the atari 's killer app : '' what can you say about a game that takes your breath away ? there are not enough superlatives to describe star raiders the book concluded that '' the game is simply great '' and that despite imitations , '' star raiders remains the classic '' in 2004 , the atari 8-bit version of star raiders was inducted into gamespot 's list of the greatest games of all time star raiders inspired later space combat games like elite , the wing commander series and battlesphere star rangers , an homage to star raiders , was released in 2010 for the iphone early production copies of the atari 2600 version of the game were accompanied by an atari force mini-comic ( published by dc comics )

like the text-based star trek games , in star raiders the player 's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships in star raiders , this part of the game takes the form of a '' galactic chart '' display dividing the game 's large-scale world into a grid of sectors , some of which are empty , while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly '' starbase '' on the higher difficulty levels , hyperwarp has a skill element ; the player has to keep a wandering cross hair roughly centered during the sequence in order to arrive precisely at the desired destination right to the star trek formula , the game added real-time 3d battles as a space combat simulator in the main first-person display , the player can look out of the ship and shoot '' photons '' at zylon ships , which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from star wars , star trek , and battlestar galactica ( whose villains were the similarly titled cylons ) there is also a '' long-range scan '' screen showing the surrounding region in a third-person overhead view centered on your ship , operating like a long-range radar display the game has four difficulty levels ; on all but the lowest '' novice '' level players must steer the ship into hyperspace and collisions with random meteoroids and enemy fire can cause damage to the player 's ship all this lends star raiders a degree of complexity and a sense of player immersion that was rare in action games of the era wanting to make an action-oriented star trek-type game , doug neubauer designed star raiders in about eight to ten months while working for atari star raiders was unusual at the time for atari , as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers , with most being adaptations of atari 2600 titles the primary playfield/star field is drawn in the graphics mode that provides 160×96 bitmapped pixels utilizing four color registers at a time out of a palette of 128 colors provided by the ctia chip in the early atari computers enemy ships , shots , and most other moving objects use atari 's variant of hardware sprites , known as player-missile graphics , which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode since the 6502 processor in the atari 8-bit family does not have a native multiply or divide command , the game slows down considerably when several of these particles are active the atari 8-bit family allows different graphics modes and color palettes to be used in different horizontal bands on the screen , by using a simple display list and a type of horizontal blank interrupt while other games make more extensive use of these techniques , star raiders uses them in a relatively simple fashion to combine text displays and graphics ; the cockpit display uses a custom character set to display futuristic-looking characters and symbols reminiscent of micr versions of star raiders were created for the atari 2600 , atari 5200 , and atari st series of computers the atari st version was designed and programmed by robert zdybel with graphics and animation by jerome domurat and released by atari corporation in 1986 while criticizing the violent gameplay , after seeing a demonstration ted nelson wrote , '' the atari machine is the most extraordinary computer graphics box ever made , and star raiders is its virtuoso demonstration game '' the magazine reported that star raiders complexity encouraged cooperative gameplay , and that '' over twenty hours of grueling tests by a battery of ingenious children '' had proven that it was free of bugs on march 12 , 2007 , the new york times reported that star raiders was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time , the so-called game canon wilmunder mentioned he had been part of a team working on 8-bit computer games and decided to make a sequel to star raiders many games heavily inspired by star raiders appeared , such as starmaster ( atari 2600 ) , space spartans ( intellivision ) , moonbeam express ( ti-99/4a ) , and star luster ( famicom–japan only )

vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly in manure composting , it also generates products that have lower salinity levels red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts , as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly users refer to european nightcrawlers by a variety of other names , including dendrobaenas , dendras , dutch nightcrawlers , and belgian nightcrawlers containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms , plants need only minimal effort to obtain them the worms ' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a '' living '' soil environment for plants the fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the drilosphere these species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population the windrow composting system is noted as a sustainable , cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste here the worms are fed an inch of '' worm chow '' across the top of the bed , and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source , the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging for vermicomposting at home , a large variety of bins are commercially available , or a variety of adapted containers may be used the design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction some cedrus , yellow cedar , and redwood contain resinous oils that may harm worms , although western red cedar has excellent longevity in composting conditions tsuga is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many nutrients than compost produced by other composting methods the worm book : the complete guide to gardening and composting with worms ten speed press eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling , such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls researchers from the pondicherry university discovered that worm composts can also be used to clean up heavy metals

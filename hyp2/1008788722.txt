vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly the earthworm species ( or composting worms ) most often used are red wigglers ( eisenia fetida or eisenia andrei ) , though european nightcrawlers ( eisenia hortensis , synonym dendrobaena veneta ) and red earthworm ( lumbricus rubellus ) could also be used red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts , as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer the worms ' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a '' living '' soil environment for plants as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin composting worms are available to order online , from nursery mail-order suppliers or angling shops where they are sold as bait these species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on the second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system the design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality soil amendments , where space is limited worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort ( turning the bin ) that composting requires 41 if a worm bin is kept outside , it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter in this process , compost is separated into large clumps , which is placed back into composting for further breakdown , and lighter compost , with which the rest of the process continues vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many nutrients than compost produced by other composting methods vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil , or mixed with water to make a liquid fertilizer known as worm tea the ph , nutrient , and microbial content of these fertilizers varies upon the inputs fed to worms an unhealthy worm bin may smell , potentially due to low oxygen conditions 92 oxygen can be provided by airholes in the bin , occasional stirring of bin contents , and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet compost worm escape maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem researchers from the pondicherry university discovered that worm composts can also be used to clean up heavy metals

vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly in manure composting , it also generates products that have lower salinity levels red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts , as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms , plants need only minimal effort to obtain them the worms ' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a '' living '' soil environment for plants the fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the drilosphere as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin these species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal , but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort ( turning the bin ) that composting requires there may be differences in vermicomposting method depending on the climate it is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems ( which can have high heat capacity properties ) , as the raw materials or feedstocks used can compost , heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste , using '' earthworms and other microorganisms to digest organic wastes , such as kitchen scraps '' in this process , compost is separated into large clumps , which is placed back into composting for further breakdown , and lighter compost , with which the rest of the process continues unlike other compost , worm castings also contain mucus which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil an unhealthy worm bin may smell , potentially due to low oxygen conditions the worm book : the complete guide to gardening and composting with worms ten speed press compost worm escape maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem

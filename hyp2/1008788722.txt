vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly in manure composting , it also generates products that have lower salinity levels red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts , as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly users refer to european nightcrawlers by a variety of other names , including dendrobaenas , dendras , dutch nightcrawlers , and belgian nightcrawlers containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer the worms ' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a '' living '' soil environment for plants as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin they can also be collected from compost and manure piles these species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population the windrow composting system is noted as a sustainable , cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source , the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities , making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates for vermicomposting at home , a large variety of bins are commercially available , or a variety of adapted containers may be used the design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort ( turning the bin ) that composting requires common earthworms such as lumbricus terrestris are anecic ( deep burrowing ) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste , using '' earthworms and other microorganisms to digest organic wastes , such as kitchen scraps '' the pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermicomposting , and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil , or mixed with water to make a liquid fertilizer known as worm tea compost worm escape maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling , such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls

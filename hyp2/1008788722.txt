vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb the worms ' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a '' living '' soil environment for plants all worms make compost but some species are not suitable for this purpose these species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout europe and north america and live in rotting vegetation , compost , and manure piles as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin these species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water canadian nightcrawlers ( us ) or common earthworm ( uk ) ) are not recommended , since they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate large-scale vermicomposting is practiced in canada , italy , japan , india , malaysia , the philippines , and the united states the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on for vermicomposting at home , a large variety of bins are commercially available , or a variety of adapted containers may be used styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal , but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort ( turning the bin ) that composting requires composting worms which are detritivorous ( eaters of trash ) , such as the red wiggler eisenia fetida , are epigeic ( surface dwellers ) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste the most common worms used in composting systems , redworms ( eisenia fetida , eisenia andrei , and lumbricus rubellus ) feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25 & nbsp ; °c ( 59-77 & nbsp ; °f ) there are few food wastes that vermicomposting can not compost , although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy , and in outdoor bins can attract vermin such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste , using '' earthworms and other microorganisms to digest organic wastes , such as kitchen scraps '' the pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermicomposting , and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins it is best discarded or applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed for further processing eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests worms generally stay in the bin , but may try to leave the bin when first introduced , or often after a rainstorm when outside humidity is high because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks , the nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent

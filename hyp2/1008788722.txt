vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because , as compared with conventional composting , it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly in manure composting , it also generates products that have lower salinity levels users refer to european nightcrawlers by a variety of other names , including dendrobaenas , dendras , dutch nightcrawlers , and belgian nightcrawlers containing water-soluble nutrients , vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer the worms ' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a '' living '' soil environment for plants all worms make compost but some species are not suitable for this purpose as they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil , they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin they can also be collected from compost and manure piles these species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water the vermicompost may be used for farming , landscaping , to create compost tea , or for sale some systems use a windrow , which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin ; organic material is added to it although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping , in theory they should not , due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on for vermicomposting at home , a large variety of bins are commercially available , or a variety of adapted containers may be used the design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction metal containers often conduct heat too readily , are prone to rusting , and may release heavy metals into the vermicompost worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort ( turning the bin ) that composting requires other soil species that contribute include insects , other worms and molds such vermicomposting systems need reliable sources of large quantities of food unlike other compost , worm castings also contain mucus which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil , or mixed with water to make a liquid fertilizer known as worm tea it is best discarded or applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed for further processing 113 the smell may also depend on the type of composted material added to the bin compost worm escape maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling , such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls

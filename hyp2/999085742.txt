aps support the connection of multiple wireless devices through their one wired connection there are many wireless data standards that have been introduced for wireless access point and wireless router technology some wireless routers provide backward compatibility with older wi-fi technologies as many devices were manufactured for use with older standards some people confuse wireless access points with wireless ad hoc networks an ad hoc network uses a connection between two or more devices without using a wireless access point ; the devices communicate directly when in range because setup is easy and does not require an access point , an ad hoc network is used in situations such as a quick data exchange or a multiplayer video game due to its peer-to-peer layout , ad hoc wi-fi connections are similar to connections available using bluetooth many wired networks base the security on physical access control , trusting all the users on the local network , but if wireless access points are connected to the network , anybody within range of the ap ( which typically extends farther than the intended area ) can attach to the network

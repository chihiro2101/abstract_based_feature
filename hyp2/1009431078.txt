repton was born in bury st edmunds , the son of a collector of excise , john repton , and martha ( née fitch ) in 1762 his father set up a transport business in norwich , where humphry attended norwich grammar school repton also joined john palmer in a venture to reform the mail-coach system , but while the scheme ultimately made palmer 's fortune , repton again lost money repton 's childhood friend was james edward smith , who encouraged him to study botany and gardening ; smith reproduces a long letter from repton in his letter and correspondence image : thomas medland01.jpg thumb left business card for humphry repton by thomas medland his capital dwindling , repton moved to a modest cottage at hare street near romford in essex since the death of capability brown in 1783 , no one figure dominated english garden design ; repton was ambitious to fill this gap and sent circulars round his contacts in the upper classes advertising his services he was at first an avid defender of brown 's views , contrasted with those of richard payne knight and uvedale price , but later adopted a moderate position in this he differed from capability brown , who worked almost exclusively with plans and rarely illustrated or wrote about his work library company of philadelphia to understand what was unique about repton it is useful to examine how he differed from brown in more detail while repton worked for equally important clients , such as the duke of bedford and portland , he was usually fine-tuning earlier work , often that of brown himself on these smaller estates , where brown would have surrounded the park with a continuous perimeter belt , repton cut vistas through to 'borrowed ' items such as church towers , making them seem part of the designed landscape repton often called the areas he landscaped 'parks ' , and so it is to repton that wembley park owes its name it is in the cottage orné style frequently used by repton thus many of repton 's 400 or so designs remained wholly or partially unexecuted and , while brown became very wealthy , repton 's income was never more than comfortable repton 's defence of brown rested partly on the impracticality of many picturesque ideas ; as a professional , repton had to produce practical and useful designs for his clients one major criticism of brown 's landscapes was the lack of a formal setting for the house , with rolling lawns sweeping right up to the front door repton re-introduced formal terraces , balustrades , trellis work and flower gardens around the house in a way that became common practice in the nineteenth century in the 1790s he often worked with the relatively unknown architect john nash , whose loose compositions suited repton 's style around 1800 , however , the two fell out , probably over nash 's refusal to credit the work of repton 's architect son john adey repton thereafter john adey and repton 's younger son george stanley repton often worked with their father , although george continued to work in nash 's office as well three roads close to the vicinity of his cottage at hare street ( now renamed main road ) in the gidea park area of romford were named after him ; repton avenue , repton gardens and repton drive , respectively '' repton revealed : the art of landscape gardening '' at the garden museum , london showing 23 of repton 's red books '' humphrey repton '' humphry repton – a gardens guide biography perry , jason '' humphrey repton '' hdl:10020/cifa850834 finding aid of collection at the getty research institute

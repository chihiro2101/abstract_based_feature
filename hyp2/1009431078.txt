repton was born in bury st edmunds , the son of a collector of excise , john repton , and martha ( née fitch ) repton 's childhood friend was james edward smith , who encouraged him to study botany and gardening ; smith reproduces a long letter from repton in his letter and correspondence image : thomas medland01.jpg thumb left business card for humphry repton by thomas medland his capital dwindling , repton moved to a modest cottage at hare street near romford in essex since the death of capability brown in 1783 , no one figure dominated english garden design ; repton was ambitious to fill this gap and sent circulars round his contacts in the upper classes advertising his services his first paid commission was catton park , to the north of norwich , in 1788 that repton , with no real experience of practical horticulture , became an overnight success , is a tribute to his undeniable talent , but also to the unique way he presented his work to help clients visualise his designs , repton produced 'red books ' ( so called for their binding ) with explanatory text and watercolours with a system of overlays to show 'before ' and 'after ' views while repton worked for equally important clients , such as the duke of bedford and portland , he was usually fine-tuning earlier work , often that of brown himself on these smaller estates , where brown would have surrounded the park with a continuous perimeter belt , repton cut vistas through to 'borrowed ' items such as church towers , making them seem part of the designed landscape in 1792 page employed humphry repton , by then famous as a landscape architect , to convert the previous farmland into wooded parkland and to make improvements to the house repton often called the areas he landscaped 'parks ' , and so it is to repton that wembley park owes its name it included the southern slopes of barn hill to the north , where repton planted trees and started building a 'prospect house ' – a gothic tower offering a view over the parkland repton may also have designed the thatched lodge that survives on wembley hill road , to the west of wembley park regrettably , repton 's red book for wembley park , which would give a definitive answer , has not survived by contrast , repton acted as a consultant , charging for his red books and sometimes staking out the ground , but leaving his client to arrange the actual execution thus many of repton 's 400 or so designs remained wholly or partially unexecuted and , while brown became very wealthy , repton 's income was never more than comfortable repton 's defence of brown rested partly on the impracticality of many picturesque ideas ; as a professional , repton had to produce practical and useful designs for his clients in the 1790s he often worked with the relatively unknown architect john nash , whose loose compositions suited repton 's style thereafter john adey and repton 's younger son george stanley repton often worked with their father , although george continued to work in nash 's office as well three roads close to the vicinity of his cottage at hare street ( now renamed main road ) in the gidea park area of romford were named after him ; repton avenue , repton gardens and repton drive , respectively permanent repton exhibit including facsimile of his red book at sheringham park '' repton revealed : the art of landscape gardening '' at the garden museum , london showing 23 of repton 's red books ( 2018 ) humphry repton in norfolk , norfolk gardens trust on the spot : the yorkshire red books of humphry repton , landscape gardener

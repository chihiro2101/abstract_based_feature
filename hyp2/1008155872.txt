for example , he managed to persuade his mother erika möbius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography , which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to west berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world 's first '' rock opera '' onto stage thus he taught himself how to play cello , guitar , the piano and other instruments , wrote lyrics and poetry and later also assumed jobs as actor in some movies and tv shows or at the theatre he kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from ralph möbius to rio reiser because he played a leading role in the movie '' johnny west '' and needed a catchy artist name during his teenage years , rio reiser first discovered—and immediately became a big fan of—the beatles at age 13 who represented the sound—and way of life—of the future for him and also inspired him to learn to play guitar , to compose his own songs and to form his first band besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the sixties , rio reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks , german '' folk songs '' and traditional music and german singers such as marlene dietrich while he still went to school , reiser became singer in his first rock band the beat kings lanrue , who was of the same age as reiser , soon became reiser 's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death after having quit school , reiser left his then hometown , as well as the beat kings , to follow his two older brothers ' call to berlin in order to compose the music for their common project , the first beat-opera , which turned out to be , in the words of rio , an '' absolute flop '' the band name can be translated both as '' clay stones shards '' and as '' sound stones shards '' , thus offering different approaches to interpretation ( sometimes also understood as a political program ) and , last not least , making reference to reiser 's favorites the rolling stones in 1975—after the band was tiring of the numerous demands and expectations by all kinds of political groups—the group settled down on a farm in stadum , in north germany which continued to be reiser 's refuge and place of inspiration even after moving back to berlin a couple of years later ton steine scherben were musically very successful and , being one of the first rock bands in germany which actually wrote and performed german rock songs , opened the door for countless successful german rock and pop bands to follow one of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in east berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold-out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the german democratic republic and the opening of the berlin wall some critics say that rio reiser created a new image of a german folk singer ; he was even called a '' schlager '' artist , and a '' volksmusik '' musician ( sometimes translated as '' folk music '' , but in a literary sense it means music of the people ) however , reiser sometimes approved of being referred to a volksmusik musician , because he thought that this would simply mean he sang music for the people

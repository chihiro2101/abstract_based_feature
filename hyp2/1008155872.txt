many of his friends said , when they were asked in an interview which was broadcast on the tv channel arte in 1998 , 2 years after his death , that he started playing music to create a place where he felt at home for example , he managed to persuade his mother erika möbius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography , which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to west berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world 's first '' rock opera '' onto stage he kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from ralph möbius to rio reiser because he played a leading role in the movie '' johnny west '' and needed a catchy artist name as an adult , rio soon discovered his musical talents which opened a way for him to express himself , thus enabling him to overcome restraints he otherwise felt due to a certain , intrinsic insecurity or shyness towards other people during his teenage years , rio reiser first discovered—and immediately became a big fan of—the beatles at age 13 who represented the sound—and way of life—of the future for him and also inspired him to learn to play guitar , to compose his own songs and to form his first band besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the sixties , rio reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks , german '' folk songs '' and traditional music and german singers such as marlene dietrich while he still went to school , reiser became singer in his first rock band the beat kings lanrue ( real name ralph peter steitz ) , a boy living in the neighbourhood , who had heard of reiser 's singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting reiser perform a few songs to give a sample ( as r.p.s lanrue , who was of the same age as reiser , soon became reiser 's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death after having quit school , reiser left his then hometown , as well as the beat kings , to follow his two older brothers ' call to berlin in order to compose the music for their common project , the first beat-opera , which turned out to be , in the words of rio , an '' absolute flop '' reiser lived together with the band and a large group of friends and supporters most of that time , first sharing a commune in berlin one of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in east berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold-out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the german democratic republic and the opening of the berlin wall recordings of the concerts prove that the east german audience knew the lyrics of his solo songs , and in particular all of the '' ton steine scherben '' songs which they performed by heart , even though the albums were hard to come by in the gdr some critics say that rio reiser created a new image of a german folk singer ; he was even called a '' schlager '' artist , and a '' volksmusik '' musician ( sometimes translated as '' folk music '' , but in a literary sense it means music of the people )

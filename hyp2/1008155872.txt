many of his friends said , when they were asked in an interview which was broadcast on the tv channel arte in 1998 , 2 years after his death , that he started playing music to create a place where he felt at home for example , he managed to persuade his mother erika möbius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography , which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to west berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world 's first '' rock opera '' onto stage thus he taught himself how to play cello , guitar , the piano and other instruments , wrote lyrics and poetry and later also assumed jobs as actor in some movies and tv shows or at the theatre he kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from ralph möbius to rio reiser because he played a leading role in the movie '' johnny west '' and needed a catchy artist name as an adult , rio soon discovered his musical talents which opened a way for him to express himself , thus enabling him to overcome restraints he otherwise felt due to a certain , intrinsic insecurity or shyness towards other people besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the sixties , rio reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks , german '' folk songs '' and traditional music and german singers such as marlene dietrich at the beginning of his career , reiser sometimes felt misfit among the political groups and various movements which , in the early seventies , did not strongly approve of homosexuality , but later gained more confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of berlin , including the gay performance group '' brühwarm '' which recorded two lps with music composed by ton steine scherben while he still went to school , reiser became singer in his first rock band the beat kings lanrue ( real name ralph peter steitz ) , a boy living in the neighbourhood , who had heard of reiser 's singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting reiser perform a few songs to give a sample ( as r.p.s lanrue , who was of the same age as reiser , soon became reiser 's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death the band soon became very popular with the squatter scene , left-wing student and workers ' movement and was invited to numerous political events to provide the soundtrack to demonstrations , parties and rallies across germany which often inspired the audience to translate the message into action afterwards ton steine scherben were musically very successful and , being one of the first rock bands in germany which actually wrote and performed german rock songs , opened the door for countless successful german rock and pop bands to follow one of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in east berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold-out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the german democratic republic and the opening of the berlin wall some critics say that rio reiser created a new image of a german folk singer ; he was even called a '' schlager '' artist , and a '' volksmusik '' musician ( sometimes translated as '' folk music '' , but in a literary sense it means music of the people )

adams was born at lidcot , a farm at laneast , near launceston , cornwall , the eldest of seven children his parents were thomas adams ( 1788–1859 ) , a poor tenant farmer , and his wife , tabitha knill grylls ( 1796–1866 ) the family were devout wesleyans who enjoyed music and among john 's brothers , thomas became a missionary , george a farmer , and william grylls adams , professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at king 's college london tabitha was a farmer 's daughter but had received a rudimentary education from john couch , her uncle , whose small library she had inherited he observed halley 's comet in 1835 from landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations , predictions and observations , engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities in 1836 , his mother inherited a small estate at badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the university of cambridge in 1821 , alexis bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of uranus , making predictions of future positions based on newton 's laws of motion and gravitation adams believed , in the face of anything that had been attempted before , that he could use the observed data on uranus , and utilising nothing more than newton 's law of gravitation , deduce the mass , position and orbit of the perturbing body apparently , adams communicated his work to james challis , director of the cambridge observatory , in mid-september 1845 , but there is some controversy as to how on 21 october 1845 , adams , returning from a cornwall vacation , without appointment , twice called on astronomer royal george biddell airy in greenwich failing to find him at home , adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution , again without the detailed calculations meanwhile , urbain le verrier , on 10 november 1845 , presented to the académie des sciences in paris a memoir on uranus , showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion however , there have been subsequent assertions that '' the brits stole neptune '' and that adams 's british contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due despite the fame of his work on neptune , adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism it has been suggested that these are symptoms of asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the '' repetitive behaviours and restricted interests '' necessary to perform the neptune calculations , in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with challis and airy in 1852 , he published new and accurate tables of the moon 's parallax , which superseded johann karl burckhardt 's , and supplied corrections to the theories of marie-charles damoiseau , giovanni antonio amedeo plana , and philippe gustave doulcet he had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of hm nautical almanac office but john russell hind was preferred , adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator '' but it was left to richard dunthorne actually to make the first quantitative assessment of the moon 's apparent acceleration two years later he succeeded challis as director of the cambridge observatory , a post adams held until his death in 1872 , isaac newton wallop , 5th earl of portsmouth , donated his private collection of newton 's papers to cambridge university after a long illness , adams died at cambridge on 21 january 1892 and was buried near his home in st giles cemetery , now the parish of the ascension burial ground in cambridge sampson ( 1900 ) lectures on the lunar theory , london : cambridge university press a collection , virtually complete , of adams 's papers regarding the discovery of neptune was presented by mrs adams to the library of st john 's college , see : sampson ( 1904 ) , and also : '' the collected papers of prof

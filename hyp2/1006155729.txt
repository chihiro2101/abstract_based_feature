adams was born at lidcot , a farm at laneast , near launceston , cornwall , the eldest of seven children his parents were thomas adams ( 1788–1859 ) , a poor tenant farmer , and his wife , tabitha knill grylls ( 1796–1866 ) the family were devout wesleyans who enjoyed music and among john 's brothers , thomas became a missionary , george a farmer , and william grylls adams , professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at king 's college london in 1821 , alexis bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of uranus , making predictions of future positions based on newton 's laws of motion and gravitation ( 2001 ) '' bouvard , alexis '' , encyclopædia britannica , deluxe cdrom edition adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the '' perturbation '' theory adams believed , in the face of anything that had been attempted before , that he could use the observed data on uranus , and utilising nothing more than newton 's law of gravitation , deduce the mass , position and orbit of the perturbing body apparently , adams communicated his work to james challis , director of the cambridge observatory , in mid-september 1845 , but there is some controversy as to how on 21 october 1845 , adams , returning from a cornwall vacation , without appointment , twice called on astronomer royal george biddell airy in greenwich only after the discovery of neptune on 23 september 1846 had been announced in paris did it become apparent that neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 august but because challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet however , there have been subsequent assertions that '' the brits stole neptune '' and that adams 's british contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due his lay fellowship at st john 's college came to an end in 1852 , and the existing statutes did not permit his re-election despite the fame of his work on neptune , adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism it has been suggested that these are symptoms of asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the '' repetitive behaviours and restricted interests '' necessary to perform the neptune calculations , in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with challis and airy '' but it was left to richard dunthorne actually to make the first quantitative assessment of the moon 's apparent acceleration in 1853 , adams published a paper showing that , while tangential terms vanish in the first-order theory of laplace , they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted small terms integral in time come to have large effects and adams concluded that plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66 '' per century at first , le verrier rejected adams 's results in 1856 , plana admitted adams 's conclusions , claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results after a long illness , adams died at cambridge on 21 january 1892 and was buried near his home in st giles cemetery , now the parish of the ascension burial ground in cambridge sampson ( 1896–1900 ) the scientific papers of john couch adams , 2 vols , london : cambridge university press , with a memoir by j adams '' , journal of the british astronomical association , 7 ( 1896–97 ) monthly notices of the royal astronomical society , 53 184 ; observatory , 15 174 ; nature , 34 565 ; 45 301 ; astronomical journal , no.254 ; r biography on the st andrews database davor krajnovic , john couch adams : mathematical astronomer , college friend of george gabriel stokes and promotor of women in astronomy

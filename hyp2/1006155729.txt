adams was born at lidcot , a farm at laneast , near launceston , cornwall , the eldest of seven children his parents were thomas adams ( 1788–1859 ) , a poor tenant farmer , and his wife , tabitha knill grylls ( 1796–1866 ) tabitha was a farmer 's daughter but had received a rudimentary education from john couch , her uncle , whose small library she had inherited in 1836 , his mother inherited a small estate at badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the university of cambridge in 1821 , alexis bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of uranus , making predictions of future positions based on newton 's laws of motion and gravitation adams believed , in the face of anything that had been attempted before , that he could use the observed data on uranus , and utilising nothing more than newton 's law of gravitation , deduce the mass , position and orbit of the perturbing body apparently , adams communicated his work to james challis , director of the cambridge observatory , in mid-september 1845 , but there is some controversy as to how various theories have been discussed as to adams 's failure to reply , such as his general nervousness , procrastination and disorganisation meanwhile , urbain le verrier , on 10 november 1845 , presented to the académie des sciences in paris a memoir on uranus , showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion on reading le verrier 's memoir , airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for english priority in discovery of the planet only after the discovery of neptune on 23 september 1846 had been announced in paris did it become apparent that neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 august but because challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet as the facts became known , there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of uranus , and each was ascribed equal importance however , there have been subsequent assertions that '' the brits stole neptune '' and that adams 's british contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due despite the fame of his work on neptune , adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism he had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of hm nautical almanac office but john russell hind was preferred , adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator at first , le verrier rejected adams 's results adams 's view was ultimately accepted and further developed , winning him the gold medal of the royal astronomical society in 1866 he was british delegate to the international meridian conference at washington in 1884 , when he also attended the meetings of the british association at montreal and of the american association at philadelphia sampson ( 1896–1900 ) the scientific papers of john couch adams , 2 vols , london : cambridge university press , with a memoir by j sampson ( 1900 ) lectures on the lunar theory , london : cambridge university press a collection , virtually complete , of adams 's papers regarding the discovery of neptune was presented by mrs adams to the library of st john 's college , see : sampson ( 1904 ) , and also : '' the collected papers of prof adams '' , journal of the british astronomical association , 7 ( 1896–97 ) monthly notices of the royal astronomical society , 53 184 ; observatory , 15 174 ; nature , 34 565 ; 45 301 ; astronomical journal , no.254 ; r biography on the st andrews database davor krajnovic , john couch adams : mathematical astronomer , college friend of george gabriel stokes and promotor of women in astronomy

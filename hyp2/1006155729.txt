adams was born at lidcot , a farm at laneast , near launceston , cornwall , the eldest of seven children the family were devout wesleyans who enjoyed music and among john 's brothers , thomas became a missionary , george a farmer , and william grylls adams , professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at king 's college london there he learned classics but was largely self-taught in mathematics , studying in the library of devonport mechanics ' institute and reading rees 's cyclopædia and samuel vince 's fluxions in 1836 , his mother inherited a small estate at badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the university of cambridge in october 1839 he entered as a sizar at st john 's college , graduating b.a in 1821 , alexis bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of uranus , making predictions of future positions based on newton 's laws of motion and gravitation ( 2001 ) '' bouvard , alexis '' , encyclopædia britannica , deluxe cdrom edition adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the '' perturbation '' theory adams believed , in the face of anything that had been attempted before , that he could use the observed data on uranus , and utilising nothing more than newton 's law of gravitation , deduce the mass , position and orbit of the perturbing body apparently , adams communicated his work to james challis , director of the cambridge observatory , in mid-september 1845 , but there is some controversy as to how on 21 october 1845 , adams , returning from a cornwall vacation , without appointment , twice called on astronomer royal george biddell airy in greenwich failing to find him at home , adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution , again without the detailed calculations meanwhile , urbain le verrier , on 10 november 1845 , presented to the académie des sciences in paris a memoir on uranus , showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion on reading le verrier 's memoir , airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for english priority in discovery of the planet only after the discovery of neptune on 23 september 1846 had been announced in paris did it become apparent that neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 august but because challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet however , there have been subsequent assertions that '' the brits stole neptune '' and that adams 's british contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due despite the fame of his work on neptune , adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism at first , le verrier rejected adams 's results adams 's view was ultimately accepted and further developed , winning him the gold medal of the royal astronomical society in 1866 in 1858 adams became professor of mathematics at the university of st andrews , but lectured only for a session , before returning to cambridge for the lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry about adams and the discovery of neptune sampson ( 1896–1900 ) the scientific papers of john couch adams , 2 vols , london : cambridge university press , with a memoir by j adams '' , journal of the british astronomical association , 7 ( 1896–97 ) monthly notices of the royal astronomical society , 53 184 ; observatory , 15 174 ; nature , 34 565 ; 45 301 ; astronomical journal , no.254 ; r

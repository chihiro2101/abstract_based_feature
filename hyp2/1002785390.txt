the tulip tree is often a large tree , 18–60 m high and 60–120 & nbsp ; cm in diameter tulipifera , but with considerable overlap between the species ; the petiole is 4–18 & nbsp ; cm long flowers are 3–10 & nbsp ; cm in diameter and have nine tepals — three green outer sepals and six inner petals which are yellow-green with an orange flare at the base they start forming after around 15 years and are superficially similar to a tulip in shape , hence the tree 's name liriodendron trees are also easily recognized by their general shape , with the higher branches sweeping together in one direction , and they are also recognizable by their height , as the taller ones usually protrude above the canopy of oaks , maples , and other trees—more markedly with the american species appalachian cove forests often contain several tulip trees of height and girth not seen in other species of eastern hardwoods in the appalachian cove forests , trees 150 to 165 & nbsp ; ft in height are common , and trees from 166 to nearly 180 & nbsp ; ft are also found more liriodendron over 170 & nbsp ; ft in height have been measured by the eastern native tree society than for any other eastern species reports of tulip trees over 200 & nbsp ; ft have been made , but none of the measurements has been confirmed by the eastern native tree society maximum circumferences for the species are between 24 and 30 & nbsp ; ft at breast height , although a few historical specimens may have been slightly larger the significance of allozyme variation and introgression in the liriodendron tulipifera complex ( magnoliaceae )

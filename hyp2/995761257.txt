thus the opteron is a non-uniform memory access ( numa ) architecture in particular , the opteron 's integrated memory controller allows the cpu to access local ram very quickly intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the opteron 's for the intel core i7 family of processors and their xeon derivatives in april 2005 , amd introduced its first multi-core opterons at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores this effectively doubled the computing performance available to each motherboard processor socket at the time of its introduction , amd 's fastest multicore opteron was the model 875 , with two cores running at 2.2 ghz each amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz amd announced its third-generation quad-core opteron chips on september 10 , 2007 with hardware vendors announcing servers in the following month 6-core opteron processors codenamed 'istanbul ' were announced on july 1 , 2009 it introduced ht & nbsp ; assist , an additional directory for data location , reducing the overhead for probing and broadcasts in march 2010 amd released the magny-cours opteron 6100 series cpus for socket g34 amd changed the naming scheme for its opteron models the opteron 6000 series cpus on socket g34 are quad-socket capable and are targeted at high-end dual-processor and quad-processor applications amd released socket 939 opterons , reducing the cost of motherboards for low-end servers and workstations this socket supports magny-cours opteron 6100 , bulldozer-based interlagos opteron 6200 , and piledriver-based '' abu dhabi '' opteron 6300 series processors for socket f and socket am2 opterons , each chip has a four-digit model number , in the form opteron xzyy amd will replace those processors at no charge list of amd opteron microprocessors tdp power cap

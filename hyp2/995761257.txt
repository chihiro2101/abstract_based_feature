the opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting ddr sdram , ddr2 sdram or ddr3 sdram ( depending on processor generation ) in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links thus the opteron is a non-uniform memory access ( numa ) architecture intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the opteron 's for the intel core i7 family of processors and their xeon derivatives in april 2005 , amd introduced its first multi-core opterons at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores this effectively doubled the computing performance available to each motherboard processor socket amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz the 2000 series and 8000 series use socket f amd announced its third-generation quad-core opteron chips on september 10 , 2007 with hardware vendors announcing servers in the following month earlier dual core ddr2 based platforms were upgradeable to quad core chips 6-core opteron processors codenamed 'istanbul ' were announced on july 1 , 2009 in march 2010 amd released the magny-cours opteron 6100 series cpus for socket g34 opteron 4000 series cpus on socket c32 ( released july 2010 ) are dual-socket capable and are targeted at uniprocessor and dual-processor uses '' the socket am2+ opterons carry model numbers of 1352 ( 2.10 & nbsp ; ghz ) , 1354 ( 2.20 & nbsp ; ghz ) , and 1356 ( 2.30 & nbsp ; ghz socket f ( lga 1207 contacts ) is amd â€™ s second generation of opteron socket this socket supports magny-cours opteron 6100 , bulldozer-based interlagos opteron 6200 , and piledriver-based '' abu dhabi '' opteron 6300 series processors this socket is physically similar to socket f but is not compatible with socket f cpus socket c32 and g34 opterons use a new four-digit numbering scheme

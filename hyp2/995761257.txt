the second capability , by itself , is less noteworthy , as major risc architectures ( such as sparc , alpha , pa-risc , powerpc , mips ) have been 64-bit for many years the opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting ddr sdram , ddr2 sdram or ddr3 sdram ( depending on processor generation ) in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links each cpu can access the main memory of another processor , transparent to the programmer the opteron approach to multi-processing is not the same as standard symmetric multiprocessing ; instead of having one bank of memory for all cpus , each cpu has its own memory thus the opteron is a non-uniform memory access ( numa ) architecture in particular , the opteron 's integrated memory controller allows the cpu to access local ram very quickly intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the opteron 's for the intel core i7 family of processors and their xeon derivatives at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores at the time of its introduction , amd 's fastest multicore opteron was the model 875 , with two cores running at 2.2 ghz each amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz the 2000 series and 8000 series use socket f based on a core design codenamed barcelona , new power and thermal management techniques were planned for the chips in march 2010 amd released the magny-cours opteron 6100 series cpus for socket g34 socket f ( lga 1207 contacts ) is amd â€™ s second generation of opteron socket the opteron line saw an update with the implementation of the amd k10 microarchitecture the opteron x1150 and opteron x2150 apu are used with the bga-769 or socket ft3 for socket 940 and socket 939 opterons , each chip has a three-digit model number , in the form opteron xyy list of amd opteron microprocessors tdp power cap

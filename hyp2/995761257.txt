the opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting ddr sdram , ddr2 sdram or ddr3 sdram ( depending on processor generation ) in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links the opteron approach to multi-processing is not the same as standard symmetric multiprocessing ; instead of having one bank of memory for all cpus , each cpu has its own memory thus the opteron is a non-uniform memory access ( numa ) architecture at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz second-generation opterons are offered in three series : the 1000 series ( single socket only ) , the 2000 series ( dual socket-capable ) , and the 8000 series ( quad or octo socket-capable ) amd announced its third-generation quad-core opteron chips on september 10 , 2007 with hardware vendors announcing servers in the following month earlier dual core ddr2 based platforms were upgradeable to quad core chips 6-core opteron processors codenamed 'istanbul ' were announced on july 1 , 2009 in march 2010 amd released the magny-cours opteron 6100 series cpus for socket g34 opteron 4000 series cpus on socket c32 ( released july 2010 ) are dual-socket capable and are targeted at uniprocessor and dual-processor uses amd introduced three quad-core opterons on socket am2+ for single-cpu servers in 2007 socket f ( lga 1207 contacts ) is amd â€™ s second generation of opteron socket this socket supports magny-cours opteron 6100 , bulldozer-based interlagos opteron 6200 , and piledriver-based '' abu dhabi '' opteron 6300 series processors this socket is physically similar to socket f but is not compatible with socket f cpus the opteron line saw an update with the implementation of the amd k10 microarchitecture for socket 940 and socket 939 opterons , each chip has a three-digit model number , in the form opteron xyy amd will replace those processors at no charge

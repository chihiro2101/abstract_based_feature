the opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting ddr sdram , ddr2 sdram or ddr3 sdram ( depending on processor generation ) in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links the opteron approach to multi-processing is not the same as standard symmetric multiprocessing ; instead of having one bank of memory for all cpus , each cpu has its own memory the opteron cpu directly supports up to an 8-way configuration , which can be found in mid-level servers intel migrated to a memory architecture similar to the opteron 's for the intel core i7 family of processors and their xeon derivatives at the time , amd 's use of the term multi-core in practice meant dual-core ; each physical opteron chip contained two processor cores this effectively doubled the computing performance available to each motherboard processor socket one socket could then deliver the performance of two processors , two sockets could deliver the performance of four processors , and so on at the time of its introduction , amd 's fastest multicore opteron was the model 875 , with two cores running at 2.2 ghz each amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz earlier dual core ddr2 based platforms were upgradeable to quad core chips 6-core opteron processors codenamed 'istanbul ' were announced on july 1 , 2009 in march 2010 amd released the magny-cours opteron 6100 series cpus for socket g34 opteron 4000 series cpus on socket c32 ( released july 2010 ) are dual-socket capable and are targeted at uniprocessor and dual-processor uses the opteron 6000 series cpus on socket g34 are quad-socket capable and are targeted at high-end dual-processor and quad-processor applications amd introduced three quad-core opterons on socket am3 for single-cpu servers in 2009 this socket supports magny-cours opteron 6100 , bulldozer-based interlagos opteron 6200 , and piledriver-based '' abu dhabi '' opteron 6300 series processors the opteron x1150 and opteron x2150 apu are used with the bga-769 or socket ft3 for socket 940 and socket 939 opterons , each chip has a three-digit model number , in the form opteron xyy

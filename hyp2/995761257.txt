the opteron processor possesses an integrated memory controller supporting ddr sdram , ddr2 sdram or ddr3 sdram ( depending on processor generation ) in multi-processor systems ( more than one opteron on a single motherboard ) , the cpus communicate using the direct connect architecture over high-speed hypertransport links the opteron approach to multi-processing is not the same as standard symmetric multiprocessing ; instead of having one bank of memory for all cpus , each cpu has its own memory in particular , the opteron 's integrated memory controller allows the cpu to access local ram very quickly as the number of cpus increases in a typical xeon system , contention for the shared bus causes computing efficiency to drop this effectively doubled the computing performance available to each motherboard processor socket one socket could then deliver the performance of two processors , two sockets could deliver the performance of four processors , and so on because motherboard costs increase dramatically as the number of cpu sockets increase , multicore cpus enable a multiprocessing system to be built at lower cost at the time of its introduction , amd 's fastest multicore opteron was the model 875 , with two cores running at 2.2 ghz each amd 's fastest single-core opteron at this time was the model 252 , with one core running at 2.6 & nbsp ; ghz in march 2010 amd released the magny-cours opteron 6100 series cpus for socket g34 these cpus updated the multi-socket opteron platform to use ddr3 memory and increased the maximum hypertransport link speed from 2.40 & nbsp ; ghz ( 4.80 & nbsp ; gt/s ) for the istanbul cpus to 3.20 & nbsp ; ghz ( 6.40 & nbsp ; gt/s ) opteron 4000 series cpus on socket c32 ( released july 2010 ) are dual-socket capable and are targeted at uniprocessor and dual-processor uses the opteron 6000 series cpus on socket g34 are quad-socket capable and are targeted at high-end dual-processor and quad-processor applications amd introduced three quad-core opterons on socket am2+ for single-cpu servers in 2007 socket g34 ( lga 1944 contacts ) is one of the third generation of opteron sockets , along with socket c32 like socket g34 , socket c32 cpus will be able to use unbuffered ecc or non-ecc ram in addition to registered ecc sdram for socket f and socket am2 opterons , each chip has a four-digit model number , in the form opteron xzyy like the previous second and third generation opterons , the second number refers to the processor generation

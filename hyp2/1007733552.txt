the french word fronde means '' sling '' ; parisian crowds used slings to smash the windows of supporters of cardinal mazarin the liberties under attack were feudal , not of individuals , but of chartered towns , where they defended the prerogatives accorded to offices in the legal patchwork of local interests and provincial identities that was france the fronde in the end provided an incentive for the establishment of royalist absolutism , since the disorders eventually discredited the feudal concept of liberty the movement soon degenerated into factions , some of which attempted to overthrow mazarin and to reverse the policies of his predecessor cardinal richelieu ( in office 1624–1642 ) who had taken power for the crown from great territorial nobles , some of whom became leaders of the fronde when louis xiv became king in 1643 , he was only a child , and though richelieu had died the year before , his policies continued to dominate french life under his successor cardinal mazarin the term frondeur was later used to refer to anyone who suggested that the power of the king should be limited , and has now passed into conservative french usage to refer to anyone who will show insubordination or engage in criticism of the powers in place first fronde , the parlementary fronde ( 1648–1649 ) the military record of the parlementary fronde is almost blank in august 1648 , feeling strengthened by the news of the louis ii de bourbon , prince de condé 's battle of lens ( 20 august 1648 ) , mazarin suddenly arrested the leaders of the parlement , whereupon paris broke into insurrection and barricaded the streets but france 's signing of the peace of westphalia ( treaty of münster , 24 october 1648 ) allowed the french army to return from the frontiers , and by january 1649 condé had put paris under siege . second fronde , the fronde of the princes ( 1650–1653 ) from then on the fronde became a story of intrigues , half-hearted warfare in a scramble for power and control of patronage , losing all trace of its first constitutional phase the leaders were discontented princes and nobles : gaston , duke of orleans ( the king 's uncle ) ; the great louis ii de bourbon and his brother armand , prince of conti ; frédéric , the duke of bouillon , and his brother henri , viscount of turenne on 14 january 1650 , cardinal mazarin , having come to an understanding with monsieur gondi and madame de chevreuse , suddenly arrested condé , conti , and longueville turenne hoped to do this with spanish assistance ; a powerful spanish army assembled in artois under the archduke leopold wilhelm , governor-general of the spanish netherlands after this campaign the civil war ceased , but in the several other campaigns of the franco-spanish war that followed , the two great soldiers were opposed to one another , turenne as the defender of france , condé as a spanish invader after bléneau , both armies marched to paris to negotiate with the , de retz and mlle de montpensier , while the archduke took more fortresses in flanders , and charles , duke of lorraine , with an army of plundering mercenaries , marched through champagne to join condé the whole country , wearied of anarchy and disgusted with the princes , came to look to the king 's party as the party of order and settled government , and thus the fronde prepared the way for the absolutism of louis xiv at one moment , near péronne , condé had turenne at a serious disadvantage , but he could not galvanize the spanish general count fuensaldaña , who was more solicitous to preserve his master 's soldiers than to establish condé as mayor of the palace to the king of france , and the armies drew apart again without fighting molé ( paris , 1859 ) memoirs of cardinal de retz lettres du cardinal mazarin ( paris , 1878–1906 ) louis madelin , la fronde ( paris : flammarion , 1931 )

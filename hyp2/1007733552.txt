the french word fronde means '' sling '' ; parisian crowds used slings to smash the windows of supporters of cardinal mazarin cardinal de retz in book ii of his memoirs attributes the usage to a witticism : '' bachoumont once said , in jest , that the parlement acted like the schoolboys in the paris ditches , who fling stones frondent , that is , fling using slings , and run away when they see the constable , but meet again as soon as he turns his back the insurrection did not start with revolutionary goals ; it aimed to protect the ancient liberties from royal encroachments and to defend the established rights of the parlements – courts of appeal rather than legislative bodies like the english parliaments – and especially the right of the parlement of paris to limit the king 's power by refusing to register decrees that ran against custom the movement soon degenerated into factions , some of which attempted to overthrow mazarin and to reverse the policies of his predecessor cardinal richelieu ( in office 1624–1642 ) who had taken power for the crown from great territorial nobles , some of whom became leaders of the fronde when louis xiv became king in 1643 , he was only a child , and though richelieu had died the year before , his policies continued to dominate french life under his successor cardinal mazarin in may 1648 a tax levied on judicial officers of the parlement of paris provoked not merely a refusal to pay but also a condemnation of earlier financial edicts and a demand for the acceptance of a scheme of constitutional reforms framed by a united committee of the parlement ( the chambre saint-louis ) , composed of members of all the sovereign courts of paris in august 1648 , feeling strengthened by the news of the louis ii de bourbon , prince de condé 's battle of lens ( 20 august 1648 ) , mazarin suddenly arrested the leaders of the parlement , whereupon paris broke into insurrection and barricaded the streets the royal faction , having no army at its immediate disposal , had to release the prisoners and promise reforms – on the night of 22 october it fled from paris the leaders were discontented princes and nobles : gaston , duke of orleans ( the king 's uncle ) ; the great louis ii de bourbon and his brother armand , prince of conti ; frédéric , the duke of bouillon , and his brother henri , viscount of turenne to these must be added gaston 's daughter , anne , duchess of montpensier ; condé 's sister , madame de longueville ; madame de chevreuse ; and the astute intriguer jean françois paul de gondi , the future cardinal de retz on 14 january 1650 , cardinal mazarin , having come to an understanding with monsieur gondi and madame de chevreuse , suddenly arrested condé , conti , and longueville at that point mazarin drew upon plessis-praslin 's army for reinforcements to be sent to subdue the rebellion in the south forcing the royal general to retire the battle ( 15 december 1650 ) was severe and for a time doubtful , but turenne 's frondeurs gave way in the end , and his army , as an army , ceased to exist turenne himself , undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama , asked and received the young king 's pardon , and meantime the court , with the and other loyal troops , had subdued the minor risings without difficulty ( march–april 1651 ) after this campaign the civil war ceased , but in the several other campaigns of the franco-spanish war that followed , the two great soldiers were opposed to one another , turenne as the defender of france , condé as a spanish invader his bold leadership made itself felt in the bléneau ( 7 april 1652 ) , in which a portion of the royal army was destroyed ; but fresh troops came up to oppose him as to the latter , turenne maneuvered past condé and planted himself in front of the mercenaries , and their leader , not wishing to expend his men against the old french regiments , consented to depart with a money payment and the promise of two tiny lorraine fortresses the general war continued in flanders , catalonia , and italy wherever a spanish and a french garrison were face to face , and condé , with the wreck of his army , openly and defiantly entered the service of the king of spain at one moment , near péronne , condé had turenne at a serious disadvantage , but he could not galvanize the spanish general count fuensaldaña , who was more solicitous to preserve his master 's soldiers than to establish condé as mayor of the palace to the king of france , and the armies drew apart again without fighting molé ( paris , 1859 ) memoirs of cardinal de retz lettres du cardinal mazarin ( paris , 1878–1906 ) louis madelin , la fronde ( paris : flammarion , 1931 )

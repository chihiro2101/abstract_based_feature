leonardo da vinci designed a sprinkler system in the 15th century in a comedy of errors , everything went wrong during a huge banquet , and a fire broke out '' the sprinkler system worked all too well , causing a flood that washed away all the food and a good part of the kitchen '' ambrose godfrey created the first successful automated sprinkler system in 1723 '' history of sprinkler systems '' the world 's first modern recognizable sprinkler system was installed in the theatre royal , drury lane in the united kingdom in 1812 by its architect , william congreve , and was covered by patent no a series of smaller pipes fed from the distribution pipe were pierced with a series of holes which pour water in the event of a fire casey cavanaugh grant , pe '' the birth of nfpa '' nfpa , 1996 '' until the 1940s , sprinklers were installed almost exclusively for the protection of commercial buildings , whose owners were generally able to recoup their expenses with savings in insurance costs over the years , fire sprinklers have become mandatory safety equipment '' in some parts of north america , in certain occupancy , including , but not limited to newly constructed '' hospitals , schools , hotels and other public buildings '' , subject to the local building codes and enforcement this is largely as a result of lobbying by the national fire sprinkler network , the european fire sprinkler network and the british automatic fire sprinkler association building regulations in scotland and england require fire sprinkler systems to be installed in certain types of properties to ensure safety of occupants in england all high rise buildings over 30 & nbsp ; m must have sprinkler protection in 2011 wales became the first country in the world to make installation of fire sprinklers in new homes mandatory in the us , sprinklers are today required in all new high rise and underground buildings generally above or below fire department access , where the ability of firefighters to provide adequate hose streams to fires is limited the primary fire code writing organization is the private national fire protection association or nfpa most us building codes allow for less expensive construction materials , larger floor area limitations , longer egress paths , and fewer requirements for fire rated construction in structures protected by fire sprinklers in 2011 , pennsylvania and california became the first us states to require sprinkler systems in all new residential construction in schools , for example , the government has issued recommendations through building bulletin 100 that most new schools should be constructed with sprinkler protection for example , the presence of a sprinkler system will usually permit doubling of compartment sizes and increases in travel distances ( to fire exits ) as well as allowing a reduction in the fire rating of internal compartment walls other nordic countries require or soon will require sprinklers in new care homes , and in finland as of 2010 a third of care homes were retrofitted with sprinklers most european countries also require sprinklers in shopping centers , in large warehouses and in high-rise buildings a sprinkler activation will do less water damage than a fire department hose stream , which provide approximately 900 litres/min ( 250 us gallons/min ) a typical sprinkler used for industrial manufacturing occupancies discharge about 75–150 litres/min ( 20–40 us gallons/min ) an automatic water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping dry pipe systems are installed in spaces in which the ambient temperature may be cold enough to freeze the water in a wet pipe system , rendering the system inoperable sections 7-2 and a7-2 water is not present in the piping until the system operates ; instead , the piping is filled with air at a pressure below the water supply pressure as the air pressure in the piping drops , the pressure across the dry pipe valve changes , allowing water to enter the piping system water flow from sprinklers , needed to control the fire , is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers this perceived benefit is due to a fear that wet system piping may slowly leak water without attracting notice , while dry pipe systems may not fail in this manner 750 gallons ) of individual dry-pipe systems , unless additional components and design efforts are provided to limit the time from sprinkler activation to water discharge to under one minute increased fire response time : because the piping is empty at the time the sprinkler operates , there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler , partially filling the piping in the process these additional precautions can increase the up-front cost of the system , but will help prevent system failure , increased maintenance costs , and premature need for system replacement in the future '' deluge '' systems are systems in which all sprinklers connected to the water piping system are open , in that the heat sensing operating element is removed , or specifically designed as such water is not present in the piping until the system operates to prevent the water supply pressure from forcing water into the piping , a '' deluge valve '' is used in the water supply connection , which is a mechanically latched valve the type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard ( e.g these systems require that both a '' preceding '' fire detection event , typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector , and an automatic sprinkler operation take place prior to the '' action '' of water introduction into the system 's piping these systems are usually used with special hazards occupancies associated with high challenge fires , such as flammable liquids , and airport hangars nfpa 750 nfpa 750 defines water mist as a water spray with a droplet size of '' less than 1000 microns at the minimum operation pressure of the discharge nozzle a commercial sprinkler system is designed to protect the structure and the occupants from a fire '' the world 's largest fire sprinkler manufacturer is the fire protection products division of tyco international active fire protection architectural engineering fire protection fire protection engineering listing and approval use and compliance passive fire protection pipe support sprinkler fitting victaulic

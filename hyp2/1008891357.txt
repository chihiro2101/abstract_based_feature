'' the sprinkler system worked all too well , causing a flood that washed away all the food and a good part of the kitchen '' history of sprinkler systems '' the world 's first modern recognizable sprinkler system was installed in the theatre royal , drury lane in the united kingdom in 1812 by its architect , william congreve , and was covered by patent no 95,000 litres ) fed by a water main which branched to all parts of the theatre a series of smaller pipes fed from the distribution pipe were pierced with a series of holes which pour water in the event of a fire casey cavanaugh grant , pe '' the birth of nfpa '' nfpa , 1996 '' until the 1940s , sprinklers were installed almost exclusively for the protection of commercial buildings , whose owners were generally able to recoup their expenses with savings in insurance costs factories , process lines , retail outlets , petrol stations , etc ) sprinklers are now commonly installed in other buildings including schools and residential premises this is largely as a result of lobbying by the national fire sprinkler network , the european fire sprinkler network and the british automatic fire sprinkler association building regulations in scotland and england require fire sprinkler systems to be installed in certain types of properties to ensure safety of occupants in scotland , all new schools are sprinkler protected , as are new care homes , sheltered housing and high rise flats in england all high rise buildings over 30 & nbsp ; m must have sprinkler protection in 2011 wales became the first country in the world to make installation of fire sprinklers in new homes mandatory sprinklers have been in use in the united states since 1874 , and were used in factory applications where fires at the turn of the century were often catastrophic in terms of both human and property losses most us building codes allow for less expensive construction materials , larger floor area limitations , longer egress paths , and fewer requirements for fire rated construction in structures protected by fire sprinklers consequently , the total building cost is often decreased by installing a sprinkler system and saving money in the other aspects of the project , as compared to building a non-sprinklered structure renewed interest in and support for sprinkler systems in the uk has resulted in sprinkler systems being more widely installed in norway as of july 2010 , all new housing of more than two storeys , all new hotels , care homes and hospitals must be sprinklered other nordic countries require or soon will require sprinklers in new care homes , and in finland as of 2010 a third of care homes were retrofitted with sprinklers this maximizes water pressure over the point of fire origin , and minimizes water damage to the building by a wide margin , wet pipe sprinkler systems are installed more often than all other types of fire sprinkler systems an automatic water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping while such systems were once common in cold areas , after several fires caused by systems running too high a percentage of antifreeze , the regulatory authority in the united states effectively banned new antifreeze installations this regulatory action has greatly increased costs and reduced options for cold weather sprinkler systems dry pipe systems are the second most common sprinkler system type dry pipe systems are most often used in unheated buildings , in parking garages , in outside canopies attached to heated buildings ( in which a wet pipe system would be provided ) , or in refrigerators in regions using nfpa regulations , wet pipe systems can not be installed unless the range of ambient temperatures remains above sections 7-2 and a7-2 water is not present in the piping until the system operates ; instead , the piping is filled with air at a pressure below the water supply pressure when one or more of the automatic sprinkler heads is triggered , it opens allowing the air in the piping to vent from that sprinkler the maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced , depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system increased complexity : dry pipe systems require additional control equipment and air pressure supply components which increases system complexity served from a single riser ) that must be provided in the building , and impact the ability of an owner to make system additions increased fire response time : because the piping is empty at the time the sprinkler operates , there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler , partially filling the piping in the process a maximum of 60 seconds is normally allowed by regulatory requirements from the time a single sprinkler opens until water is discharged onto the fire the internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems ( in which the piping is constantly full of water ) is much lower , as the amount of oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower the operation of double interlock systems are similar to deluge systems except that automatic sprinklers are used instead of compressed gas , some systems use a high-pressure pump to pressurize the water so it atomizes as it exits the sprinkler nozzle these calculations account for all of the pressure that is lost or gained between the water supply source and the sprinklers that would operate in the design area if water damage or water volume is of particular concern , a technique called water mist fire suppression may be an alternative in 2008 , the installed costs of sprinkler systems ranged from us 0.31 – 3.66 per square foot , depending on type and location according to the national fire protection association ( nfpa ) , fires in hotels with sprinklers averaged 78 % less damage than fires in hotels without them ( 1983–1987 ) active fire protection architectural engineering fire protection fire protection engineering listing and approval use and compliance passive fire protection pipe support sprinkler fitting victaulic

leonardo da vinci designed a sprinkler system in the 15th century '' the sprinkler system worked all too well , causing a flood that washed away all the food and a good part of the kitchen the world 's first modern recognizable sprinkler system was installed in the theatre royal , drury lane in the united kingdom in 1812 by its architect , william congreve , and was covered by patent no a series of smaller pipes fed from the distribution pipe were pierced with a series of holes which pour water in the event of a fire over the years , fire sprinklers have become mandatory safety equipment '' in some parts of north america , in certain occupancy , including , but not limited to newly constructed '' hospitals , schools , hotels and other public buildings '' , subject to the local building codes and enforcement this is largely as a result of lobbying by the national fire sprinkler network , the european fire sprinkler network and the british automatic fire sprinkler association building regulations in scotland and england require fire sprinkler systems to be installed in certain types of properties to ensure safety of occupants in england all high rise buildings over 30 & nbsp ; m must have sprinkler protection sprinklers have been in use in the united states since 1874 , and were used in factory applications where fires at the turn of the century were often catastrophic in terms of both human and property losses building codes , which specify which buildings require sprinklers are generally left to local jurisdictions if building codes do not explicitly mandate the use of fire sprinklers , the code often makes it highly advantageous to install them as an optional system in 2011 , pennsylvania and california became the first us states to require sprinkler systems in all new residential construction renewed interest in and support for sprinkler systems in the uk has resulted in sprinkler systems being more widely installed for example , the presence of a sprinkler system will usually permit doubling of compartment sizes and increases in travel distances ( to fire exits ) as well as allowing a reduction in the fire rating of internal compartment walls a fire in an illegal immigrant detention center at schiphol airport in the netherlands on 27 october 2005 killed 11 detainees and led to the retrofitting of sprinklers in all similarly designed prisons in the netherlands each closed-head sprinkler is held closed by either a heat-sensitive glass bulb or a two-part metal link held together with fusible alloy the glass bulb or link applies pressure to a pipe cap which acts as a plug which prevents water from flowing until the ambient temperature around the sprinkler reaches the design activation temperature of the individual sprinkler head in a standard wet-pipe sprinkler system , each sprinkler activates independently when the predetermined heat level is reached a sprinkler activation will do less water damage than a fire department hose stream , which provide approximately 900 litres/min ( 250 us gallons/min ) a typical sprinkler used for industrial manufacturing occupancies discharge about 75–150 litres/min ( 20–40 us gallons/min ) however , a typical early suppression fast response ( esfr ) sprinkler at a pressure of will discharge approximately by a wide margin , wet pipe sprinkler systems are installed more often than all other types of fire sprinkler systems an automatic water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping while such systems were once common in cold areas , after several fires caused by systems running too high a percentage of antifreeze , the regulatory authority in the united states effectively banned new antifreeze installations a sunset date of 2022 applies to older antifreeze systems in the usa dry pipe systems are most often used in unheated buildings , in parking garages , in outside canopies attached to heated buildings ( in which a wet pipe system would be provided ) , or in refrigerators sections 7-2 and a7-2 water is not present in the piping until the system operates ; instead , the piping is filled with air at a pressure below the water supply pressure this puts a premium on proper maintenance , as this increase in system complexity results in an inherently less reliable overall system ( i.e a maximum of 60 seconds is normally allowed by regulatory requirements from the time a single sprinkler opens until water is discharged onto the fire these additional precautions can increase the up-front cost of the system , but will help prevent system failure , increased maintenance costs , and premature need for system replacement in the future they are sometimes installed in personnel egress paths or building openings to slow travel of fire ( e.g to prevent the water supply pressure from forcing water into the piping , a '' deluge valve '' is used in the water supply connection , which is a mechanically latched valve because the heat sensing elements present in the automatic sprinklers have been removed ( resulting in open sprinklers ) , the deluge valve must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system the initiation device signals the fire alarm panel , which in turn signals the deluge valve to open in operation , the deluge system activates a fire alarm initiating device , or a manual pull station , signals the fire alarm panel , which in turn signals the deluge valve to open , allowing water to enter the piping system in this way , the system is essentially converted from a dry system into a wet system the nozzles used may not be listed fire sprinklers , and are usually selected for a specific spray pattern to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the hazard ( e.g water spray systems can also be used externally on the surfaces of tanks containing flammable liquids or gases ( such as hydrogen ) systems can be applied using local application method or total flooding method , similar to clean agent fire protection systems some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish a fire with such a system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system nationwide in the united states , one and two-family homes generally do not require fire sprinkler systems , although the overwhelming loss of life due to fires occurs in these spaces active fire protection architectural engineering fire protection fire protection engineering listing and approval use and compliance passive fire protection pipe support sprinkler fitting victaulic

leonardo da vinci designed a sprinkler system in the 15th century leonardo automated his patron 's kitchen with a super-oven and a system of conveyor belts the world 's first modern recognizable sprinkler system was installed in the theatre royal , drury lane in the united kingdom in 1812 by its architect , william congreve , and was covered by patent no a series of smaller pipes fed from the distribution pipe were pierced with a series of holes which pour water in the event of a fire he continued to improve the device and in 1890 invented the glass disc sprinkler , essentially the same as that in use today over the years , fire sprinklers have become mandatory safety equipment '' in some parts of north america , in certain occupancy , including , but not limited to newly constructed '' hospitals , schools , hotels and other public buildings '' , subject to the local building codes and enforcement however , outside of the us and canada , sprinklers are rarely mandated by building codes for normal hazard occupancies which do not have large numbers of occupants ( e.g ) sprinklers are now commonly installed in other buildings including schools and residential premises this is largely as a result of lobbying by the national fire sprinkler network , the european fire sprinkler network and the british automatic fire sprinkler association in scotland , all new schools are sprinkler protected , as are new care homes , sheltered housing and high rise flats sprinklers have been in use in the united states since 1874 , and were used in factory applications where fires at the turn of the century were often catastrophic in terms of both human and property losses in the us , sprinklers are today required in all new high rise and underground buildings generally above or below fire department access , where the ability of firefighters to provide adequate hose streams to fires is limited the primary fire code writing organization is the private national fire protection association or nfpa if building codes do not explicitly mandate the use of fire sprinklers , the code often makes it highly advantageous to install them as an optional system in 2011 , pennsylvania and california became the first us states to require sprinkler systems in all new residential construction renewed interest in and support for sprinkler systems in the uk has resulted in sprinkler systems being more widely installed a fire in an illegal immigrant detention center at schiphol airport in the netherlands on 27 october 2005 killed 11 detainees and led to the retrofitting of sprinklers in all similarly designed prisons in the netherlands most european countries also require sprinklers in shopping centers , in large warehouses and in high-rise buildings in a standard wet-pipe sprinkler system , each sprinkler activates independently when the predetermined heat level is reached this maximizes water pressure over the point of fire origin , and minimizes water damage to the building a sprinkler activation will do less water damage than a fire department hose stream , which provide approximately 900 litres/min ( 250 us gallons/min ) a typical sprinkler used for industrial manufacturing occupancies discharge about 75–150 litres/min ( 20–40 us gallons/min ) by a wide margin , wet pipe sprinkler systems are installed more often than all other types of fire sprinkler systems wet systems may be charged with an antifreeze chemical , for use where pipes ca n't reliably be kept above 40 & nbsp ; °f ( 4 & nbsp ; °c ) dry pipe systems are most often used in unheated buildings , in parking garages , in outside canopies attached to heated buildings ( in which a wet pipe system would be provided ) , or in refrigerators sections 7-2 and a7-2 water is not present in the piping until the system operates ; instead , the piping is filled with air at a pressure below the water supply pressure water flow from sprinklers , needed to control the fire , is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers table 7.2.3.6.1 some property owners and building occupants may view dry pipe sprinklers as advantageous for protection of collections care and other water sensitive areas disadvantages of using dry pipe fire sprinkler systems include : if the sprinklers share the same standpipe system as the standpipe system which supplies fire hoses , then the water supply to the fire hoses would be severely reduced or even curtailed altogether increased complexity : dry pipe systems require additional control equipment and air pressure supply components which increases system complexity this puts a premium on proper maintenance , as this increase in system complexity results in an inherently less reliable overall system ( i.e increased fire response time : because the piping is empty at the time the sprinkler operates , there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler , partially filling the piping in the process increased corrosion potential : following operation or testing , dry-pipe sprinkler system piping is drained , but residual water collects in piping low spots , and moisture is also retained in the atmosphere within the piping corrosion can be combated by using copper or stainless steel pipe which is less susceptible to corrosion , or by using nitrogen gas to pressurize the system , rather than air '' deluge '' systems are systems in which all sprinklers connected to the water piping system are open , in that the heat sensing operating element is removed , or specifically designed as such prior to fire detection , if the sprinkler operates , or the piping system develops a leak , loss of air pressure in the piping will activate a trouble alarm sprinkler operation is often controlled via an algorithm that determines which sprinklers will operate and when nfpa 750 nfpa 750 defines water mist as a water spray with a droplet size of '' less than 1000 microns at the minimum operation pressure of the discharge nozzle sprinkler systems are intended to either control the fire or to suppress the fire residential systems , installed at the time of initial home construction and utilizing municipal water supplies , average about us 0.35/square foot '' home fire sprinkler cost assessment '' , published 2008 by the fire protection research foundation systems can be installed during construction or retrofitted active fire protection architectural engineering fire protection fire protection engineering listing and approval use and compliance passive fire protection pipe support sprinkler fitting victaulic

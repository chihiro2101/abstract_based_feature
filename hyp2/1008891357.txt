leonardo da vinci designed a sprinkler system in the 15th century '' the sprinkler system worked all too well , causing a flood that washed away all the food and a good part of the kitchen the world 's first modern recognizable sprinkler system was installed in the theatre royal , drury lane in the united kingdom in 1812 by its architect , william congreve , and was covered by patent no parmalee 's design and in 1881 patented the automatic sprinkler that bears his name he continued to improve the device and in 1890 invented the glass disc sprinkler , essentially the same as that in use today however , outside of the us and canada , sprinklers are rarely mandated by building codes for normal hazard occupancies which do not have large numbers of occupants ( e.g factories , process lines , retail outlets , petrol stations , etc ) sprinklers are now commonly installed in other buildings including schools and residential premises this is largely as a result of lobbying by the national fire sprinkler network , the european fire sprinkler network and the british automatic fire sprinkler association building regulations in scotland and england require fire sprinkler systems to be installed in certain types of properties to ensure safety of occupants in scotland , all new schools are sprinkler protected , as are new care homes , sheltered housing and high rise flats in 2011 wales became the first country in the world to make installation of fire sprinklers in new homes mandatory sprinklers may be required to be installed by building codes , or may be recommended by insurance company to reduce potential property losses or business interruption the primary fire code writing organization is the private national fire protection association or nfpa however , there are some exceptions : in 1990 the us congress passed pl-101-391 , better known as the hotel and motel fire safety act of 1990 if building codes do not explicitly mandate the use of fire sprinklers , the code often makes it highly advantageous to install them as an optional system most us building codes allow for less expensive construction materials , larger floor area limitations , longer egress paths , and fewer requirements for fire rated construction in structures protected by fire sprinklers for example , the presence of a sprinkler system will usually permit doubling of compartment sizes and increases in travel distances ( to fire exits ) as well as allowing a reduction in the fire rating of internal compartment walls other nordic countries require or soon will require sprinklers in new care homes , and in finland as of 2010 a third of care homes were retrofitted with sprinklers a fire in an illegal immigrant detention center at schiphol airport in the netherlands on 27 october 2005 killed 11 detainees and led to the retrofitting of sprinklers in all similarly designed prisons in the netherlands a d√ºsseldorf airport fire on 11 april 1996 which killed 17 people led to sprinklers being retrofitted in all major german airports most european countries also require sprinklers in shopping centers , in large warehouses and in high-rise buildings this maximizes water pressure over the point of fire origin , and minimizes water damage to the building however , a typical early suppression fast response ( esfr ) sprinkler at a pressure of will discharge approximately by a wide margin , wet pipe sprinkler systems are installed more often than all other types of fire sprinkler systems an automatic water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping dry pipe systems are the second most common sprinkler system type dry pipe systems are most often used in unheated buildings , in parking garages , in outside canopies attached to heated buildings ( in which a wet pipe system would be provided ) , or in refrigerators as the air pressure in the piping drops , the pressure across the dry pipe valve changes , allowing water to enter the piping system water flow from sprinklers , needed to control the fire , is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers table 7.2.3.6.1 some property owners and building occupants may view dry pipe sprinklers as advantageous for protection of collections care and other water sensitive areas this perceived benefit is due to a fear that wet system piping may slowly leak water without attracting notice , while dry pipe systems may not fail in this manner lower design flexibility : regulatory requirements limit the maximum permitted size ( i.e 750 gallons ) of individual dry-pipe systems , unless additional components and design efforts are provided to limit the time from sprinkler activation to water discharge to under one minute served from a single riser ) that must be provided in the building , and impact the ability of an owner to make system additions this delay in fire suppression results in a larger fire prior to control , increasing property damage they are sometimes installed in personnel egress paths or building openings to slow travel of fire ( e.g activation of either the fire detectors alone , or sprinklers alone , without the concurrent operation of the other , will not allow water to enter the piping most sprinkler systems installed today are designed using an area and density approach some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish a fire with such a system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system '' home fire sprinkler cost assessment '' , published 2008 by the fire protection research foundation systems can be installed during construction or retrofitted '' the world 's largest fire sprinkler manufacturer is the fire protection products division of tyco international

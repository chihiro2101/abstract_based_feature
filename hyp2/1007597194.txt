as these tests measure only the dna along the direct matrilineal and patrilineal lines of inheritance , they can not tell what total percentage of european , indigenous , or african ancestry any individual has a person with african ancestry could be considered legally white if he could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had been legally white people of black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white , in contrast to the '' one-drop rule '' put into law in the early 20th century in the united states in colonial and antebellum times in certain locations , persons of three-quarters or more white ancestry were considered legally white if born to slave mothers , however , this status did not overrule their being considered slaves , like sally hemings , who was three-quarters white , and her children by thomas jefferson , who were seven-eighths white , and all born into slavery starting with virginia in 1662 , colonies adopted the principle of partus sequitur ventrem in slave law , which said that children born in the colony were born into the status of their mother thus , children born to slave mothers were born into slavery , regardless of who their fathers were and whether they were baptized as christians children born to white mothers were free , even if they were mixed-race children born to free mixed-race mothers were also free this meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free '' but southern colonies began to prohibit indian slavery in the eighteenth century , so , according to their own laws , even mixed-race children born to native american women should be considered free multiracial children born to native american mothers were customarily raised in her family and specific tribal culture if the multiracial children were born to slave women ( generally of at least partial african descent ) , they were classified under slave law as slaves if mixed-race children were born to native american mothers , they should be considered free , but sometimes slaveholders kept them in slavery anyway

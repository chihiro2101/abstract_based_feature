'' front side '' refers to the external interface from the processor to the rest of the computer system , as opposed to the back side , where the back-side bus connects the cache ( and potentially other cpus ) the fsb design was a performance improvement over the single system bus designs of the previous decades , but these front-side buses are sometimes referred to as the '' system bus '' front-side buses usually connect the cpu and the rest of the hardware via a chipset , which intel implemented as a northbridge and a southbridge other buses like the peripheral component interconnect ( pci ) , accelerated graphics port ( agp ) , and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices these secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock , but are not necessarily synchronized to it the frequency at which a processor ( cpu ) operates is determined by applying a clock multiplier to the front-side bus ( fsb ) speed in some cases that is , the cpu is set to run at 8 times the frequency of the front-side bus : 400 & nbsp ; mhz & times ; 8 3200 & nbsp ; mhz the memory bus connects the northbridge and ram , just as the front-side bus connects the cpu and northbridge the memory will run 5/4 times as fast as the fsb in this situation , meaning a 400 & nbsp ; mhz bus can run with the memory at 500 & nbsp ; mhz similar to the memory bus , the pci and agp buses can also be run asynchronously from the front-side bus the front-side bus was criticized by amd as being an old and slow technology that limits system performance for example , if a motherboard ( or processor ) has its bus set at 200 & nbsp ; mhz and performs 4 transfers per clock cycle , the fsb is rated at 800 mt/s

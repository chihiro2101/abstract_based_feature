a front-side bus ( fsb ) is mostly used on pc-related motherboards ( including personal computers and servers ) the fsb design was a performance improvement over the single system bus designs of the previous decades , but these front-side buses are sometimes referred to as the '' system bus these secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock , but are not necessarily synchronized to it the frequency at which a processor ( cpu ) operates is determined by applying a clock multiplier to the front-side bus ( fsb ) speed in some cases for example , a processor running at 3200 mhz might be using a 400 & nbsp ; mhz fsb that is , the cpu is set to run at 8 times the frequency of the front-side bus : 400 & nbsp ; mhz & times ; 8 3200 & nbsp ; mhz the memory bus connects the northbridge and ram , just as the front-side bus connects the cpu and northbridge increasing the front-side bus to 450 & nbsp ; mhz in most cases also means running the memory at 450 & nbsp ; mhz the memory will run 5/4 times as fast as the fsb in this situation , meaning a 400 & nbsp ; mhz bus can run with the memory at 500 & nbsp ; mhz in older systems , these buses are operated at a set fraction of the front-side bus frequency the front-side bus was criticized by amd as being an old and slow technology that limits system performance in a traditional architecture , the front-side bus served as the immediate data link between the cpu and all other devices in the system , including main memory

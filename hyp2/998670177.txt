'' front side '' refers to the external interface from the processor to the rest of the computer system , as opposed to the back side , where the back-side bus connects the cache ( and potentially other cpus ) a front-side bus ( fsb ) is mostly used on pc-related motherboards ( including personal computers and servers ) the fsb design was a performance improvement over the single system bus designs of the previous decades , but these front-side buses are sometimes referred to as the '' system bus other buses like the peripheral component interconnect ( pci ) , accelerated graphics port ( agp ) , and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices the frequency at which a processor ( cpu ) operates is determined by applying a clock multiplier to the front-side bus ( fsb ) speed in some cases this means there is an internal cpu multiplier setting ( also called bus/core ratio ) of 8 that is , the cpu is set to run at 8 times the frequency of the front-side bus : 400 & nbsp ; mhz & times ; 8 3200 & nbsp ; mhz the memory bus connects the northbridge and ram , just as the front-side bus connects the cpu and northbridge increasing the front-side bus to 450 & nbsp ; mhz in most cases also means running the memory at 450 & nbsp ; mhz similar to the memory bus , the pci and agp buses can also be run asynchronously from the front-side bus in a traditional architecture , the front-side bus served as the immediate data link between the cpu and all other devices in the system , including main memory for example , if a motherboard ( or processor ) has its bus set at 200 & nbsp ; mhz and performs 4 transfers per clock cycle , the fsb is rated at 800 mt/s

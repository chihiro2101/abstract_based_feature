in israel it has been extirpated as a breeder since 1981 , but young birds have been reported in 2000 , 2004 and 2016 this species is almost entirely associated with mountains and monadnock with plentiful cliffs , crags , precipices , canyons and gorges they seem to prefer desolate , lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones , such as wolves and golden eagles , have healthy populations in ethiopia , they are now common at refuse tips on the outskirts of small villages and towns although they occasionally descend to , bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of and normally reside above in some parts of their range during 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern africa declined however their distribution remained constant the bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of lesotho , free state , eastern cape and maloti-drakensberg mountains in kwazulu-natal abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species ' range in southern africa the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds the bird , nicknamed 'vigo ' by tim birch of the derbyshire wildlife trust , is believed to have originated from the reintroduced population in the alps unlike most vultures , the bearded vulture does not have a bald head bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head , breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic the juvenile bird is dark black-brown over most of the body , with a buff-brown breast and takes five years to reach full maturity the bearded vulture is silent , apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like cheek-acheek call made around the nest in flight.jpg adult in flight from below ( note the tail shape ) file : bartgeier_gypaetus_barbatus_front2_richard_bartz.jpg adult spreading wings the bearded vulture diet comprises mammals ( 93 % ) , birds ( 6 % ) and reptiles ( 1 % ) , with medium-sized ungulates forming a large part of the diet it usually disdains the actual meat and lives on a diet that is typically 85â€“90 % bone marrow the bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up to the size of a lamb 's femur and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces after dropping the large bones , the bearded vulture spirals or glides down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked its old name of ossifrage ( '' bone breaker '' ) relates to this habit less frequently , these birds have been observed trying to break bones ( usually of a medium size ) by hammering them with their bill directly into rocks while perched live prey is sometimes attacked by the bearded vulture , with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture to kill tortoises , bearded vultures fly with them to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles ' hard shells golden eagles have been observed to kill tortoises in the same way while foraging for bones or live prey while in flight , bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground , staying around high the bearded vulture is one of the most endangered european bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined there have been mitigation plans that have been established to reduce the population declines in bearded vulture populations the bearded vulture is considered a threatened species in iran

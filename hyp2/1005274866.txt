in africa , it is found in the atlas mountains , the ethiopian highlands and south from sudan to northeastern democratic republic of the congo , central kenya and northern tanzania this species is almost entirely associated with mountains and monadnock with plentiful cliffs , crags , precipices , canyons and gorges they are often found near alpine pastures and meadows , montane grassland and heath , steep-sided , rocky wadis , high steppe and are occasional around forests although they occasionally descend to , bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of and normally reside above in some parts of their range they even have been observed living at altitudes of on mount everest and been observed flying at a height of during 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern africa declined however their distribution remained constant the bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of lesotho , free state , eastern cape and maloti-drakensberg mountains in kwazulu-natal adult bearded vultures utilise areas with higher altitudes , with steep slopes and sharp points and within areas that are situated closer to their nesting sites adult bearded vultures are more likely to fly below 200 & nbsp ; m over lesotho along the drakensberg escarpment from the area of golden gate highlands national park south into the northern part of the eastern cape there was the greatest densities of bearded vultures abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species ' range in southern africa the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds a series of sightings took place in 2020 , when an individual bird was sighted separately over the channel island of alderney after migrating north through france , then in the peak district , derbyshire , cambridgeshire and lincolnshire the bird , nicknamed 'vigo ' by tim birch of the derbyshire wildlife trust , is believed to have originated from the reintroduced population in the alps it is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long , narrow wings , with the wing chord measuring , and long , wedge-shaped tail , which measures in length it has a generally elongated , slender shape , sometimes appearing bulkier due to the often hunched back of these birds the creamy-coloured forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin , which form a black beard that give the species its english name bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head , breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic the juvenile bird is dark black-brown over most of the body , with a buff-brown breast and takes five years to reach full maturity the bearded vulture is silent , apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like cheek-acheek call made around the nest the acid concentration of the bearded vulture stomach has been estimated to be of ph about 1 the bearded vulture diet comprises mammals ( 93 % ) , birds ( 6 % ) and reptiles ( 1 % ) , with medium-sized ungulates forming a large part of the diet live prey is sometimes attacked by the bearded vulture , with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture the mean productivity of the bearded vulture is 0.43±0.28 fledgings/breeding pair/year and the breeding success averaged 0.56±0.30 fledgings/pair with clutches/year the growing availability of firearms , combined with bounties offered for dead vultures , caused a sharp decline in the bearded vulture population around the alps a second attempt was made in 1987 , using a technique called '' hacking , '' by which young individuals ( from 90 to 100 days ) from zoological parks would be taken from the nest and placed in a protected area in the alps the increase in human population and infrastructure results in the declines of the bearded vulture populations today the bearded vulture is considered a threatened species in iran

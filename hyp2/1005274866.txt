in africa , it is found in the atlas mountains , the ethiopian highlands and south from sudan to northeastern democratic republic of the congo , central kenya and northern tanzania in israel it has been extirpated as a breeder since 1981 , but young birds have been reported in 2000 , 2004 and 2016 they seem to prefer desolate , lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones , such as wolves and golden eagles , have healthy populations although they occasionally descend to , bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of and normally reside above in some parts of their range in southern armenia they have been found to breed below if cliff availability permits during 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern africa declined however their distribution remained constant the bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of lesotho , free state , eastern cape and maloti-drakensberg mountains in kwazulu-natal adult bearded vultures utilise areas with higher altitudes , with steep slopes and sharp points and within areas that are situated closer to their nesting sites adult bearded vultures are more likely to fly below 200 & nbsp ; m over lesotho along the drakensberg escarpment from the area of golden gate highlands national park south into the northern part of the eastern cape there was the greatest densities of bearded vultures abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species ' range in southern africa the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds though a rare visitor , bearded vultures occasionally travel to parts of the united kingdom , with the first confirmed sighting taking place in 2016 in wales and the westcountry it is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long , narrow wings , with the wing chord measuring , and long , wedge-shaped tail , which measures in length in flight.jpg adult in flight from below ( note the tail shape ) file : bartgeier_gypaetus_barbatus_front2_richard_bartz.jpg adult spreading wings bearded vultures avoid remains of larger species ( such as cows and horses ) probably because of the variable cost/benefit ratios in handling efficiency , ingestion process and transportation of the remains after dropping the large bones , the bearded vulture spirals or glides down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked to kill tortoises , bearded vultures fly with them to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles ' hard shells larger animals have been known to be attacked by bearded vultures , including ibex , capra goats , chamois and steenbok this is unconfirmed , however , and if it does happen , most biologists who have studied the birds generally agree it would be accidental on the part of the vulture while foraging for bones or live prey while in flight , bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground , staying around high occasionally , breeding pairs may forage and hunt together in the ethiopian highlands , bearded vultures have adapted to living largely off human refuse the bearded vulture had a very poor reputation in early modern europe , due in large part to tales of the birds stealing babies and livestock this method has proven more successful , with over 200 birds released in the alps from 1987 to 2015 , and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the alps the bearded vulture is one of the most endangered european bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined there have been mitigation plans that have been established to reduce the population declines in bearded vulture populations the bearded vulture is considered a threatened species in iran

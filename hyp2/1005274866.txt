in africa , it is found in the atlas mountains , the ethiopian highlands and south from sudan to northeastern democratic republic of the congo , central kenya and northern tanzania this species is almost entirely associated with mountains and monadnock with plentiful cliffs , crags , precipices , canyons and gorges they seem to prefer desolate , lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones , such as wolves and golden eagles , have healthy populations in ethiopia , they are now common at refuse tips on the outskirts of small villages and towns although they occasionally descend to , bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of and normally reside above in some parts of their range they are typically found around or above the tree line which are often near the tops of the mountains , at up to in europe , in africa and in central asia they even have been observed living at altitudes of on mount everest and been observed flying at a height of during 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern africa declined however their distribution remained constant the bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of lesotho , free state , eastern cape and maloti-drakensberg mountains in kwazulu-natal along the drakensberg escarpment from the area of golden gate highlands national park south into the northern part of the eastern cape there was the greatest densities of bearded vultures abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species ' range in southern africa the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds though a rare visitor , bearded vultures occasionally travel to parts of the united kingdom , with the first confirmed sighting taking place in 2016 in wales and the westcountry unlike most vultures , the bearded vulture does not have a bald head the bearded vulture diet comprises mammals ( 93 % ) , birds ( 6 % ) and reptiles ( 1 % ) , with medium-sized ungulates forming a large part of the diet the bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up to the size of a lamb 's femur and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces after dropping the large bones , the bearded vulture spirals or glides down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked this learned skill requires extensive practice by immature birds and takes up to seven years to master tortoises preyed on may be nearly as heavy as the preying vulture to kill tortoises , bearded vultures fly with them to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles ' hard shells larger animals have been known to be attacked by bearded vultures , including ibex , capra goats , chamois and steenbok these animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths ; although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other occasionally , breeding pairs may forage and hunt together the large birds also regularly lock feet with each other and fall some distance through the sky with each other in europe the breeding pairs of bearded vultures are estimated to be 120 this method has proven more successful , with over 200 birds released in the alps from 1987 to 2015 , and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the alps the bearded vulture is considered a threatened species in iran in the bible/torah , the bearded vulture , as the ossifrage , is among the birds forbidden to be eaten ( leviticus 11:13 )

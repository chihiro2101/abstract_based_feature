in africa , it is found in the atlas mountains , the ethiopian highlands and south from sudan to northeastern democratic republic of the congo , central kenya and northern tanzania they are often found near alpine pastures and meadows , montane grassland and heath , steep-sided , rocky wadis , high steppe and are occasional around forests they seem to prefer desolate , lightly-populated areas where predators who provide many bones , such as wolves and golden eagles , have healthy populations although they occasionally descend to , bearded vultures are rare below an elevation of and normally reside above in some parts of their range they are typically found around or above the tree line which are often near the tops of the mountains , at up to in europe , in africa and in central asia during 1970s and 1980s the population of the bearded vulture in southern africa declined however their distribution remained constant the bearded vulture population occupies the highlands of lesotho , free state , eastern cape and maloti-drakensberg mountains in kwazulu-natal abundance of bearded vultures is shown for eight regions within the species ' range in southern africa the total population of bearded vultures in southern africa is calculated as being 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds though a rare visitor , bearded vultures occasionally travel to parts of the united kingdom , with the first confirmed sighting taking place in 2016 in wales and the westcountry a series of sightings took place in 2020 , when an individual bird was sighted separately over the channel island of alderney after migrating north through france , then in the peak district , derbyshire , cambridgeshire and lincolnshire the bird , nicknamed 'vigo ' by tim birch of the derbyshire wildlife trust , is believed to have originated from the reintroduced population in the alps it is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long , narrow wings , with the wing chord measuring , and long , wedge-shaped tail , which measures in length bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head , breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic the bearded vulture is silent , apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like cheek-acheek call made around the nest the acid concentration of the bearded vulture stomach has been estimated to be of ph about 1 the bearded vulture diet comprises mammals ( 93 % ) , birds ( 6 % ) and reptiles ( 1 % ) , with medium-sized ungulates forming a large part of the diet bearded vultures avoid remains of larger species ( such as cows and horses ) probably because of the variable cost/benefit ratios in handling efficiency , ingestion process and transportation of the remains this is the only living bird species that specializes in feeding on marrow the bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up to the size of a lamb 's femur and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces the bearded vulture has learned to crack bones too large to be swallowed by carrying them in flight to a height of above the ground and then dropping them onto rocks below , which smashes them into smaller pieces and exposes the nutritious marrow less frequently , these birds have been observed trying to break bones ( usually of a medium size ) by hammering them with their bill directly into rocks while perched live prey is sometimes attacked by the bearded vulture , with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture while foraging for bones or live prey while in flight , bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground , staying around high the growing availability of firearms , combined with bounties offered for dead vultures , caused a sharp decline in the bearded vulture population around the alps the increase in human population and infrastructure results in the declines of the bearded vulture populations today the bearded vulture is considered a threatened species in iran the ancient greeks used ornithomancys to guide their political decisions : bearded vultures , or ossifragae were one of the few species of birds that could yield valid signs to these soothsayers

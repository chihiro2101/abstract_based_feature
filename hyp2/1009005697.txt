chameleons have very good eyesight for reptiles , letting them see small insects from a 5–10 meter distance chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels , are more inclined to bask and feed , and are also more likely to reproduce , as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland thumb all chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts the hyoid bone has an elongated , parallel-sided projection , called the entoglossal process , over which a tubular muscle , the accelerator muscle , sits the tongue retractor muscle , the hyoglossus , connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle , and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection tongue projection occurs at extremely high performance , reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds , having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 g the power with which the tongue is launched , known to exceed 3000 w kg −1 , exceeds that which muscle is able to produce , indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection one consequence of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction , which is powered by muscle contraction alone , and is heavily thermally sensitive while other ectotherm become sluggish as their body temperatures decline , due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles , chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures the thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons , however , is not a problem , as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it , including surface phenomena , such as wet adhesion and interlocking , and suction certain species of chameleons have bones that glow when under ultraviolet light , also known as biogenic fluorescence some 31 different species of calumma chameleons , all native to madagascar , displayed this fluorescence in ct scans the bones emitted a bright blue glow and could even shine through the chameleon 's four layers of skin most species from the subfamily brookesiinae , which includes the genera brookesia , rieppeleon , and rhampholeon , live low in vegetation or on the ground among leaf litter small brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs , while large veiled chameleons ( chamaeleo calyptratus ) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 ( veiled chameleons ) and 10–40 ( panther chameleons ) eggs chameleons generally eat insects , but larger species , such as the common chameleon , may also take other lizards and young birds some chameleons like the panther chameleon of madagascar regulate their vitamin d3 levels , of which their insect diet is a poor source , by exposing themselves to sunlight since its uv component increases internal production birds and snakes represent the most important predation of adult chameleons and invertebrates , especially ants , put a high predatory pressure on chameleon eggs and juveniles

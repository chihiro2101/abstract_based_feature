each eye can pivot and focus independently , allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels , are more inclined to bask and feed , and are also more likely to reproduce , as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland thumb all chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts thus , smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates , and can project their tongues more than twice their body length chamaeleonidae.com the chameleon 's tongue apparatus consists of highly modified hyoid , tongue muscles , and collagen the tongue retractor muscle , the hyoglossus , connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle , and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection tongue projection occurs at extremely high performance , reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds , having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 g the power with which the tongue is launched , known to exceed 3000 w kg −1 , exceeds that which muscle is able to produce , indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection one consequence of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction , which is powered by muscle contraction alone , and is heavily thermally sensitive the thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation , when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive , likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result certain species of chameleons have bones that glow when under ultraviolet light , also known as biogenic fluorescence there are introduced , feral populations of veiled and jackson 's chameleons in hawaii , and isolated pockets of feral jackson 's chameleons have been reported in california , florida and texas image : chameleon - tanzania - usambara mountains.jpg thumb left west usambara two-horned chameleon ( kinyongia multituberculata ) in the usambara mountains , tanzania image : chameleon hebron , palestine.jpg thumb right chamaeleo chamaeleon found in hebron small brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs , while large veiled chameleons ( chamaeleo calyptratus ) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 ( veiled chameleons ) and 10–40 ( panther chameleons ) eggs the eggs of parson 's chameleon ( calumma parsonii ) , a species which is rare in captivity , are believed to take more than 24 months to hatch the common chameleon of europe , north africa , and the near east , chamaeleo chamaeleon , mainly eats wasps and mantises ; such arthropods form over three quarters of its diet birds and snakes represent the most important predation of adult chameleons and invertebrates , especially ants , put a high predatory pressure on chameleon eggs and juveniles they adopt a defensive body posture , present an attacker a laterally flattened body to appear larger , warn with an open mouth and , if needed , utilize feet and jaws to fight back

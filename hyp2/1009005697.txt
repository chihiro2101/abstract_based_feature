each eye can pivot and focus independently , allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously nature 373:692-694 like snakes , chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear , so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels , are more inclined to bask and feed , and are also more likely to reproduce , as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts thus , smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates , and can project their tongues more than twice their body length the accelerator muscle contracts around the entoglossal process and is responsible for creating the work to power tongue projection , both directly and through the loading of collagenous elements located between the entoglossal process and the accelerator muscle tongue projection occurs at extremely high performance , reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds , having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 g the power with which the tongue is launched , known to exceed 3000 w kg −1 , exceeds that which muscle is able to produce , indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection one consequence of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction , which is powered by muscle contraction alone , and is heavily thermally sensitive while other ectotherm become sluggish as their body temperatures decline , due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles , chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures the thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons , however , is not a problem , as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it , including surface phenomena , such as wet adhesion and interlocking , and suction the thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation , when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive , likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result certain species of chameleons have bones that glow when under ultraviolet light , also known as biogenic fluorescence some 31 different species of calumma chameleons , all native to madagascar , displayed this fluorescence in ct scans the glow results from proteins , pigments , chitin , and other materials that make up a chameleon 's skeleton , possibly giving chameleons a secondary signaling system that does not interfere with their color-changing ability , and may have evolved from sexual selection small brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs , while large veiled chameleons ( chamaeleo calyptratus ) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 ( veiled chameleons ) and 10–40 ( panther chameleons ) eggs chameleons lay flexible-shelled eggs which are affected by environmental characteristics during incubation chameleons generally eat insects , but larger species , such as the common chameleon , may also take other lizards and young birds the common chameleon of europe , north africa , and the near east , chamaeleo chamaeleon , mainly eats wasps and mantises ; such arthropods form over three quarters of its diet

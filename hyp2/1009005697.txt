each eye can pivot and focus independently , allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously chameleons have very good eyesight for reptiles , letting them see small insects from a 5–10 meter distance nature 373:692-694 like snakes , chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear , so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum however , chameleons are not deaf : they can detect sound frequencies in the range of 200–600 & nbsp ; hz thumb all chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts chamaeleonidae.com the chameleon 's tongue apparatus consists of highly modified hyoid , tongue muscles , and collagen the tongue retractor muscle , the hyoglossus , connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle , and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection tongue projection occurs at extremely high performance , reaching the prey in as little as 0.07 seconds , having been launched at accelerations exceeding 41 g while other ectotherm become sluggish as their body temperatures decline , due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles , chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures some 31 different species of calumma chameleons , all native to madagascar , displayed this fluorescence in ct scans the bones emitted a bright blue glow and could even shine through the chameleon 's four layers of skin there are introduced , feral populations of veiled and jackson 's chameleons in hawaii , and isolated pockets of feral jackson 's chameleons have been reported in california , florida and texas chameleons inhabit all kinds of tropics and mountain rain forests , savannas , and sometimes deserts and steppes most species from the subfamily brookesiinae , which includes the genera brookesia , rieppeleon , and rhampholeon , live low in vegetation or on the ground among leaf litter the eggs of parson 's chameleon ( calumma parsonii ) , a species which is rare in captivity , are believed to take more than 24 months to hatch chameleons generally eat insects , but larger species , such as the common chameleon , may also take other lizards and young birds they adopt a defensive body posture , present an attacker a laterally flattened body to appear larger , warn with an open mouth and , if needed , utilize feet and jaws to fight back 110 chameleons are subject to several protozoan parasites , such as plasmodium which causes malaria , trypanosoma which causes sleeping sickness , and leishmania which causes leishmaniasis

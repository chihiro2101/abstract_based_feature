each eye can pivot and focus independently , allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously chameleons have very good eyesight for reptiles , letting them see small insects from a 5–10 meter distance nature 373:692-694 like snakes , chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear , so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels , are more inclined to bask and feed , and are also more likely to reproduce , as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland thumb all chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts thus , smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates , and can project their tongues more than twice their body length the hyoid bone has an elongated , parallel-sided projection , called the entoglossal process , over which a tubular muscle , the accelerator muscle , sits the accelerator muscle contracts around the entoglossal process and is responsible for creating the work to power tongue projection , both directly and through the loading of collagenous elements located between the entoglossal process and the accelerator muscle the tongue retractor muscle , the hyoglossus , connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle , and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection while other ectotherm become sluggish as their body temperatures decline , due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles , chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures the thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons , however , is not a problem , as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it , including surface phenomena , such as wet adhesion and interlocking , and suction the thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation , when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive , likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result the bones emitted a bright blue glow and could even shine through the chameleon 's four layers of skin the glow results from proteins , pigments , chitin , and other materials that make up a chameleon 's skeleton , possibly giving chameleons a secondary signaling system that does not interfere with their color-changing ability , and may have evolved from sexual selection image : chameleon - tanzania - usambara mountains.jpg thumb left west usambara two-horned chameleon ( kinyongia multituberculata ) in the usambara mountains , tanzania image : chameleon hebron , palestine.jpg thumb right chamaeleo chamaeleon found in hebron small brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs , while large veiled chameleons ( chamaeleo calyptratus ) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 ( veiled chameleons ) and 10–40 ( panther chameleons ) eggs chameleons generally eat insects , but larger species , such as the common chameleon , may also take other lizards and young birds chameleons are preyed upon and consumed by a variety of other animals

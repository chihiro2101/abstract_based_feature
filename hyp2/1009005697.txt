each eye can pivot and focus independently , allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously nature 373:692-694 like snakes , chameleons do not have an outer or a middle ear , so there is neither an ear opening nor an eardrum chameleons exposed to ultraviolet light show increased social behavior and activity levels , are more inclined to bask and feed , and are also more likely to reproduce , as it has a positive effect on the pineal gland thumb all chameleons are primarily insectivores that feed by ballistically projecting their long tongues from their mouths to capture prey located some distance away while the chameleons ' tongues are typically thought to be one and a half to two times the length of their bodies ( their length excluding the tail ) , smaller chameleons ( both smaller species and smaller individuals of the same species ) have recently been found to have proportionately larger tongue apparatuses than their larger counterparts thus , smaller chameleons are able to project their tongues greater distances than the larger chameleons that are the subject of most studies and tongue length estimates , and can project their tongues more than twice their body length chamaeleonidae.com the chameleon 's tongue apparatus consists of highly modified hyoid , tongue muscles , and collagen the hyoid bone has an elongated , parallel-sided projection , called the entoglossal process , over which a tubular muscle , the accelerator muscle , sits the tongue retractor muscle , the hyoglossus , connects the hyoid and accelerator muscle , and is responsible for drawing the tongue back into the mouth following tongue projection the power with which the tongue is launched , known to exceed 3000 w kg −1 , exceeds that which muscle is able to produce , indicating the presence of an elastic power amplifier to power tongue projection the recoil of elastic elements in the tongue apparatus is thus responsible for large percentages of the overall tongue projection performance while other ectotherm become sluggish as their body temperatures decline , due to a reduction in the contractile velocity of their muscles , chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures the thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons , however , is not a problem , as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it , including surface phenomena , such as wet adhesion and interlocking , and suction chameleons inhabit all kinds of tropics and mountain rain forests , savannas , and sometimes deserts and steppes the typical chameleons from the subfamily chamaeleoninae are arboreal , usually living in trees or bushes , although a few ( notably the namaqua chameleon ) are partially or largely terrestrial image : chameleon - tanzania - usambara mountains.jpg thumb left west usambara two-horned chameleon ( kinyongia multituberculata ) in the usambara mountains , tanzania image : chameleon hebron , palestine.jpg thumb right chamaeleo chamaeleon found in hebron small brookesia species may only lay two to four eggs , while large veiled chameleons ( chamaeleo calyptratus ) have been known to lay clutches of 20–200 ( veiled chameleons ) and 10–40 ( panther chameleons ) eggs the range of diets can be seen from the following examples : the veiled chameleon , chamaeleo calyptratus from arabia , is insectivorous , but eats leaves when other sources of water are not available some chameleons like the panther chameleon of madagascar regulate their vitamin d3 levels , of which their insect diet is a poor source , by exposing themselves to sunlight since its uv component increases internal production

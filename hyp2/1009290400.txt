) correspondingly , the dimensions of a symmetrical paraboloidal dish are related by the equation : \scriptstyle 4fd r^2 , where \scriptstyle f is the focal length , \scriptstyle d is the depth of the dish ( measured along the axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim ) , and \scriptstyle r is the radius of the dish from the center a more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish measured along its surface the parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape : any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point , or '' focus '' ) because many types of energy can be reflected in this way , parabolic reflectors can be used to collect and concentrate energy entering the reflector at a particular angle similarly , energy radiating from the focus to the dish can be transmitted outward in a beam that is parallel to the axis of the dish in contrast with spherical reflectors , which suffer from a spherical aberration that becomes stronger as the ratio of the beam diameter to the focal distance becomes larger , parabolic reflectors can be made to accommodate beams of any width however , if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis ( or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus ) , parabolic reflectors suffer from an aberration called coma the precision to which a parabolic dish must be made in order to focus energy well depends on the wavelength of the energy if the dish is wrong by a quarter of a wavelength , then the reflected energy will be wrong by a half wavelength , which means that it will interfere destructively with energy that has been reflected properly from another part of the dish the wavelength range of visible light is between about 400 and 700 nanometres ( nm ) , so in order to focus all visible light well , a reflector must be correct to within about 20 & nbsp ; nm for comparison , the diameter of a human hair is usually about 50,000 & nbsp ; nm , so the required accuracy for a reflector to focus visible light is about 2500 times less than the diameter of a hair for example , the flaw in the hubble space telescope mirror ( too flat by about 2,200 & nbsp ; nm at its perimeter ) caused severe spherical aberration until corrected with costar microwaves , such as are used for satellite-tv signals , have wavelengths of the order of ten millimetres , so dishes to focus these waves can be wrong by half a millimetre or so and still perform well however , if the reflector is used to focus incoming energy onto a receiver , the shadow of the receiver falls onto the vertex of the paraboloid , which is part of the reflector , so part of the reflector is wasted the principle of parabolic reflectors has been known since classical antiquity , when the mathematician diocles described them in his book on burning mirrors and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to collimate a point of light from a lantern into a beam , before being replaced by more efficient fresnel lenses in the 19th century

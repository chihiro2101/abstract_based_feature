) however , in informal language , the word parabola and its associated adjective parabolic are often used in place of paraboloid and paraboloidal if a parabola is positioned in cartesian coordinates with its vertex at the origin and its axis of symmetry along the y-axis , so the parabola opens upward , its equation is \scriptstyle 4fy x^2 , where \scriptstyle f is its focal length all units used for the radius , focal point and depth must be the same the parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape : any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point , or '' focus '' ) because many types of energy can be reflected in this way , parabolic reflectors can be used to collect and concentrate energy entering the reflector at a particular angle similarly , energy radiating from the focus to the dish can be transmitted outward in a beam that is parallel to the axis of the dish in contrast with spherical reflectors , which suffer from a spherical aberration that becomes stronger as the ratio of the beam diameter to the focal distance becomes larger , parabolic reflectors can be made to accommodate beams of any width however , if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis ( or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus ) , parabolic reflectors suffer from an aberration called coma the precision to which a parabolic dish must be made in order to focus energy well depends on the wavelength of the energy the wavelength range of visible light is between about 400 and 700 nanometres ( nm ) , so in order to focus all visible light well , a reflector must be correct to within about 20 & nbsp ; nm if the dish is symmetrical and made of uniform material of constant thickness , and if f represents the focal length of the paraboloid , this '' focus-balanced '' condition occurs if the depth of the dish , measured along the axis of the paraboloid from the vertex to the plane of the rim of the dish , is 1.8478 times f the focus-balanced configuration ( see above ) requires the depth of the reflector dish to be greater than its focal length , so the focus is within the dish this is a paraboloidal mirror which is rotated about axes that pass through its centre of mass , but this does not coincide with the focus , which is outside the dish the principle of parabolic reflectors has been known since classical antiquity , when the mathematician diocles described them in his book on burning mirrors and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to collimate a point of light from a lantern into a beam , before being replaced by more efficient fresnel lenses in the 19th century a parabolic reflector pointing upward can be formed by rotating a reflective liquid , like mercury , around a vertical axis

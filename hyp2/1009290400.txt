) however , in informal language , the word parabola and its associated adjective parabolic are often used in place of paraboloid and paraboloidal if a parabola is positioned in cartesian coordinates with its vertex at the origin and its axis of symmetry along the y-axis , so the parabola opens upward , its equation is \scriptstyle 4fy x^2 , where \scriptstyle f is its focal length ) correspondingly , the dimensions of a symmetrical paraboloidal dish are related by the equation : \scriptstyle 4fd r^2 , where \scriptstyle f is the focal length , \scriptstyle d is the depth of the dish ( measured along the axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim ) , and \scriptstyle r is the radius of the dish from the center the parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape : any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point , or '' focus '' ) because many types of energy can be reflected in this way , parabolic reflectors can be used to collect and concentrate energy entering the reflector at a particular angle similarly , energy radiating from the focus to the dish can be transmitted outward in a beam that is parallel to the axis of the dish however , if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis ( or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus ) , parabolic reflectors suffer from an aberration called coma the precision to which a parabolic dish must be made in order to focus energy well depends on the wavelength of the energy if the dish is wrong by a quarter of a wavelength , then the reflected energy will be wrong by a half wavelength , which means that it will interfere destructively with energy that has been reflected properly from another part of the dish the wavelength range of visible light is between about 400 and 700 nanometres ( nm ) , so in order to focus all visible light well , a reflector must be correct to within about 20 & nbsp ; nm this is a paraboloidal mirror which is rotated about axes that pass through its centre of mass , but this does not coincide with the focus , which is outside the dish often , the segment includes the vertex of the paraboloid , where its curvature is greatest , and where the axis of symmetry intersects the paraboloid however , if the reflector is used to focus incoming energy onto a receiver , the shadow of the receiver falls onto the vertex of the paraboloid , which is part of the reflector , so part of the reflector is wasted the principle of parabolic reflectors has been known since classical antiquity , when the mathematician diocles described them in his book on burning mirrors and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to collimate a point of light from a lantern into a beam , before being replaced by more efficient fresnel lenses in the 19th century the most common modern applications of the parabolic reflector are in satellite dishes , reflecting telescopes , radio telescopes , parabolic microphones , solar cookers , and many lighting devices such as spotlights , headlight , par lamps and led housings

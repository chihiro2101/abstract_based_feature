while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them 380 acp jacketed hollow point for short range target shooting on ranges up to 50 meters ( 55 yd ) , aerodynamics are relatively unimportant and velocities are low the semiwadcutter consists of a conical section that comes to a smaller flat , and a thin sharp shoulder at the base of the cone for steel targets , the concern is to provide enough force to knock over the target while minimizing the damage to the target a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target there are also specialized bullets designed for use in long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles ; the designs vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point military now issues ammunition to snipers that use bullets of this type in 7.62×51mm nato , m852 match and m118lr ammunition are issued , both of which use sierra matchking bullets ; in 5.56×45mm nato , those u.s marine snipers who use accurized m16 ( rifle ) are issued the mk 262 mod 0 cartridge developed jointly by black hills ammunition and crane naval surface warfare center , using a bullet manufactured by sierra bullets that was cannelured according to military specifications for this project for ultra long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles and military sniping , radically designed very-low-drag ( vld ) bullets are available that are generally produced out of rods of mono-metal alloys on cnc lathes bullets for maximum penetration are designed to resist deformation on impact , and usually are made of lead that is covered in a copper , brass , or mild steel jacket ( some are even solid copper or bronze alloy ) the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) for penetrating substances significantly harder than jacketed lead , the lead core is supplemented with or replaced with a harder material , such as hardened steel many modern tank guns are smoothbore , not rifled , because practical rifling twists can only stabilize projectiles , such as an apcbc ( apcbc ) , with a length-to-diameter ratio of up to about 5:1 and also because the rifling adds friction , reducing the velocity and thus total force it is possible to achieve to get the maximum force on the smallest area , modern anti-tank rounds have aspect ratios of 10:1 or more since these can not be stabilized by rifling , they are built instead like large darts , with fins providing the stabilizing force instead of rifling these bullets are designed to increase their surface area on impact , thus creating greater drag and limiting the travel through the target while a bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding , allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily , in some applications , preventing exit from the rear of the target is more desirable flat-point bullets , with fronts of up to 90 % of the overall bullet diameter , are usually designed for use against large or dangerous game they are often made of unusually hard alloys , are longer and heavier than normal for their caliber , and even include exotic materials such as tungsten to increase their sectional density these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs from any shooting angle and at a far enough range the disadvantage of flat point bullets is the reduction in aerodynamic performance ; the flat point induces much drag , leading to significantly reduced velocities at long range more effective on lighter targets are the expanding bullets , the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet for the purposes of aerodynamic efficiency the tip of the hollowpoint will often be tipped with a pointed polymer 'nose ' which may also aid in expansion by functioning as a piston upon impact pushing the hollow point open however , on larger game fragmenting ammunition provides inadequate penetration of vital organs to ensure a clean kill ; instead , a '' splash wound '' may result many large calibre projectiles are filled with a high explosive which , when detonated , shatters the shell casing , producing thousands of high velocity fragments and an accompanying sharply rising blast overpressure more rarely , others are used to release chemical or biological agents , either on impact or when over the target area ; designing an appropriate fuse is a difficult task which lies outside the realm of terminal ballistics they also produce a much larger diameter hole in comparison to a shaped charge and hence produce a far more extensive behind armour effect

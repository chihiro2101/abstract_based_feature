while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them there are three basic classes of bullets : those designed for maximum accuracy at varying ranges those designed to maximize damage to a target by penetrating as deeply as possible those designed to avoid over-penetration of a target , by deforming to control the depth to which the bullet penetrates , which as a by-product , deals more damage inside the wound the third class may limit penetration by expanding or fragmenting as long as the bullet is balanced so it does not tumble , the aerodynamics are unimportant the flat front punches out a large hole in the paper , close to , if not equal to , the full diameter of the bullet a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target there are also specialized bullets designed for use in long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles ; the designs vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point for ultra long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles and military sniping , radically designed very-low-drag ( vld ) bullets are available that are generally produced out of rods of mono-metal alloys on cnc lathes to achieve this , the bullets have to be very long and normal cartridge overall lengths often have to be exceeded bullets for maximum penetration are designed to resist deformation on impact , and usually are made of lead that is covered in a copper , brass , or mild steel jacket ( some are even solid copper or bronze alloy ) the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core ; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration the current nato 5.56mm ss109 ( m855 ) bullet uses a steel-tipped lead core to improve penetration , the steel tip providing resistance to deformation for armor piercing , and the heavier lead core ( 25 % heavier than the previous bullet , the m193 ) providing increased sectional density for better penetration in soft targets many modern tank guns are smoothbore , not rifled , because practical rifling twists can only stabilize projectiles , such as an apcbc ( apcbc ) , with a length-to-diameter ratio of up to about 5:1 and also because the rifling adds friction , reducing the velocity and thus total force it is possible to achieve these bullets are designed to increase their surface area on impact , thus creating greater drag and limiting the travel through the target a desirable side effect is that the expanded bullet makes a larger hole , increasing tissue damage and speeding incapacitation while a bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding , allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily , in some applications , preventing exit from the rear of the target is more desirable the simplest maximum disruption bullet is one with a wide , flat tip flat-point bullets , with fronts of up to 90 % of the overall bullet diameter , are usually designed for use against large or dangerous game the hollow point peels back into several connected pieces ( sometimes referred to as petals due to their appearance ) causing the bullet to create a larger area of permanent damage for the purposes of aerodynamic efficiency the tip of the hollowpoint will often be tipped with a pointed polymer 'nose ' which may also aid in expansion by functioning as a piston upon impact pushing the hollow point open penetration of the hollowpoint would be less than half that of a similar nonexpanding bullet , and the resulting wound or permanent cavity would be much wider it might seem that if the whole purpose of a maximum disruption round is to expand to a larger diameter , it would make more sense to start out with the desired diameter rather than relying on the somewhat inconsistent results of expansion on impact a larger diameter bullet is going to have significantly more drag than a smaller diameter bullet of the same mass , which means long range performance will be significantly degraded in contrast to a hollowpoint which attempts to stay in one large piece retaining as much weight as possible whilst presenting the most surface area to the target , a fragmenting bullet is intended to break up into many small pieces almost instantly also used are bullets similar to hollowpoint bullets or soft point bullets whose cores and/or jackets are deliberately weakened to cause deformation or fragmentation upon impact this becomes irrelevant when shooting at longer ranges because it is unlikely that fragments created by the impact of any type of bullet on a steel target will travel more than 50-100yds , in these long range cases it is of more value to use bullets that fly identically to those to be used in real situations than to mitigate the possible risks of bullet fragments and ricochets so frangible bullets are typically not used more rarely , others are used to release chemical or biological agents , either on impact or when over the target area ; designing an appropriate fuse is a difficult task which lies outside the realm of terminal ballistics they also produce a much larger diameter hole in comparison to a shaped charge and hence produce a far more extensive behind armour effect

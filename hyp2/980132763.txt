while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them common factors include bullet weight , composition , velocity , and shape 380 acp jacketed hollow point for short range target shooting on ranges up to 50 meters ( 55 yd ) , aerodynamics are relatively unimportant and velocities are low for shooting at paper targets , the best bullet is one that will punch a perfect hole through the target since cutting the edge of a target ring will result in scoring the higher score , fractions of an inch are important the semiwadcutter consists of a conical section that comes to a smaller flat , and a thin sharp shoulder at the base of the cone a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target air force discovered that bullets are more stable in flight for longer distances and more resistant to crosswinds if the center of gravity is somewhat to the rear of the center of pressure the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point in 7.62×51mm nato , m852 match and m118lr ammunition are issued , both of which use sierra matchking bullets ; in 5.56×45mm nato , those u.s for ultra long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles and military sniping , radically designed very-low-drag ( vld ) bullets are available that are generally produced out of rods of mono-metal alloys on cnc lathes the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) for penetrating substances significantly harder than jacketed lead , the lead core is supplemented with or replaced with a harder material , such as hardened steel military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core ; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration since these can not be stabilized by rifling , they are built instead like large darts , with fins providing the stabilizing force instead of rifling the final category of bullets is that intended to control penetration so as not to harm anything behind the target these bullets are designed to increase their surface area on impact , thus creating greater drag and limiting the travel through the target a desirable side effect is that the expanded bullet makes a larger hole , increasing tissue damage and speeding incapacitation while a bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding , allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily , in some applications , preventing exit from the rear of the target is more desirable they are often made of unusually hard alloys , are longer and heavier than normal for their caliber , and even include exotic materials such as tungsten to increase their sectional density these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply through muscle and bone , while causing a wound channel of nearly the full diameter of the bullet for the purposes of aerodynamic efficiency the tip of the hollowpoint will often be tipped with a pointed polymer 'nose ' which may also aid in expansion by functioning as a piston upon impact pushing the hollow point open penetration of the hollowpoint would be less than half that of a similar nonexpanding bullet , and the resulting wound or permanent cavity would be much wider a larger diameter bullet also means more space is required to store the ammunition , which means either bulkier guns or smaller magazine capacities especially where the military requirement of a nonexpanding round is concerned , there is fierce debate over whether it is better to have fewer , larger bullets for enhanced terminal effects , or more , smaller bullets for increased number of potential target hits however , on larger game fragmenting ammunition provides inadequate penetration of vital organs to ensure a clean kill ; instead , a '' splash wound '' may result more rarely , others are used to release chemical or biological agents , either on impact or when over the target area ; designing an appropriate fuse is a difficult task which lies outside the realm of terminal ballistics shaped charges have been used ever since it was discovered that a block of high explosives with letters engraved in it created perfect impressions of those letters when detonated against a piece of metal when detonated at the correct standoff to the armour , the jet violently forces its way through the target 's armour

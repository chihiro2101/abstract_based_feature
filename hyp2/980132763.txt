while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them there are three basic classes of bullets : those designed for maximum accuracy at varying ranges those designed to maximize damage to a target by penetrating as deeply as possible those designed to avoid over-penetration of a target , by deforming to control the depth to which the bullet penetrates , which as a by-product , deals more damage inside the wound the third class may limit penetration by expanding or fragmenting 380 acp jacketed hollow point for short range target shooting on ranges up to 50 meters ( 55 yd ) , aerodynamics are relatively unimportant and velocities are low for shooting at paper targets , the best bullet is one that will punch a perfect hole through the target the flat front punches out a large hole in the paper , close to , if not equal to , the full diameter of the bullet a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target there are also specialized bullets designed for use in long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles ; the designs vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point for ultra long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles and military sniping , radically designed very-low-drag ( vld ) bullets are available that are generally produced out of rods of mono-metal alloys on cnc lathes to achieve this , the bullets have to be very long and normal cartridge overall lengths often have to be exceeded the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core ; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration many modern tank guns are smoothbore , not rifled , because practical rifling twists can only stabilize projectiles , such as an apcbc ( apcbc ) , with a length-to-diameter ratio of up to about 5:1 and also because the rifling adds friction , reducing the velocity and thus total force it is possible to achieve to get the maximum force on the smallest area , modern anti-tank rounds have aspect ratios of 10:1 or more since these can not be stabilized by rifling , they are built instead like large darts , with fins providing the stabilizing force instead of rifling the final category of bullets is that intended to control penetration so as not to harm anything behind the target such bullets are used primarily for hunting and civilian antipersonnel use ; they are not generally used by the military , since the use of expanding bullets in international conflicts is prohibited by the hague convention and because these bullets have less chance of penetrating modern body armor a perforating bullet can continue on ( likely not coaxial to the original trajectory due to target deflection ) and might cause unintended damage or injury flat-point bullets , with fronts of up to 90 % of the overall bullet diameter , are usually designed for use against large or dangerous game these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply through muscle and bone , while causing a wound channel of nearly the full diameter of the bullet one of the hunting applications of the flat point bullet is large game such as bear hunted with a handgun in a more effective on lighter targets are the expanding bullets , the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet the hollow point fills with body tissue and fluids on impact , then expands as the bullet continues to have matter pushed into it a larger diameter bullet is going to have significantly more drag than a smaller diameter bullet of the same mass , which means long range performance will be significantly degraded also used are bullets similar to hollowpoint bullets or soft point bullets whose cores and/or jackets are deliberately weakened to cause deformation or fragmentation upon impact the most common of these bullets are made of small diameter lead pellets , placed in a thin copper shell and held in place by an epoxy or similar binding agent these bullets are usually restricted to pistol cartridges and rifle cartridges intended for use at very short ranges , as the nonhomogenous cores tend to cause inaccuracies that , while acceptable at short ranges , are not acceptable for the long ranges at which some rifles are used more rarely , others are used to release chemical or biological agents , either on impact or when over the target area ; designing an appropriate fuse is a difficult task which lies outside the realm of terminal ballistics contrary to popular belief , the jet of a copper-lined shaped charge is not molten , although it is heated to about 500 & nbsp ;

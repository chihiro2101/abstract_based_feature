while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them 380 acp jacketed hollow point for short range target shooting on ranges up to 50 meters ( 55 yd ) , aerodynamics are relatively unimportant and velocities are low for shooting at paper targets , the best bullet is one that will punch a perfect hole through the target the semiwadcutter consists of a conical section that comes to a smaller flat , and a thin sharp shoulder at the base of the cone a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target there are also specialized bullets designed for use in long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles ; the designs vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer the matchking bullet ( which is still in wide use and holds many records ) is a hollow point design with a tiny aperture in the jacket at the point of the bullet and a hollow air space under the point of the bullet , where previous conventional bullets had a lead core that went all the way up to the point in 7.62×51mm nato , m852 match and m118lr ammunition are issued , both of which use sierra matchking bullets ; in 5.56×45mm nato , those u.s marine snipers who use accurized m16 ( rifle ) are issued the mk 262 mod 0 cartridge developed jointly by black hills ammunition and crane naval surface warfare center , using a bullet manufactured by sierra bullets that was cannelured according to military specifications for this project the use of a wildcat based ( ultra ) long-range cartridge demands the use of a custom or customized rifle with an appropriately cut chamber and a fast-twist bore focusing the largest amount of momentum on the smallest possible area of the target provides the greatest penetration bullets for maximum penetration are designed to resist deformation on impact , and usually are made of lead that is covered in a copper , brass , or mild steel jacket ( some are even solid copper or bronze alloy ) the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) the current nato 5.56mm ss109 ( m855 ) bullet uses a steel-tipped lead core to improve penetration , the steel tip providing resistance to deformation for armor piercing , and the heavier lead core ( 25 % heavier than the previous bullet , the m193 ) providing increased sectional density for better penetration in soft targets such bullets are used primarily for hunting and civilian antipersonnel use ; they are not generally used by the military , since the use of expanding bullets in international conflicts is prohibited by the hague convention and because these bullets have less chance of penetrating modern body armor these bullets are designed to increase their surface area on impact , thus creating greater drag and limiting the travel through the target a desirable side effect is that the expanded bullet makes a larger hole , increasing tissue damage and speeding incapacitation while a bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding , allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily , in some applications , preventing exit from the rear of the target is more desirable flat-point bullets , with fronts of up to 90 % of the overall bullet diameter , are usually designed for use against large or dangerous game these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply through muscle and bone , while causing a wound channel of nearly the full diameter of the bullet the disadvantage of flat point bullets is the reduction in aerodynamic performance ; the flat point induces much drag , leading to significantly reduced velocities at long range more effective on lighter targets are the expanding bullets , the hollow point bullet and the soft point bullet these are designed to use the hydraulic pressure of muscle tissue to expand the bullet 45-caliber pistols are available with high-capacity magazines ( para ordnance being one of the first in the late 1980s ) many people find the wide grip required uncomfortable and difficult to use the warsaw pact 5.45×39mm m74 assault rifle round exemplifies a trend that is becoming common in the era of high velocity , small caliber military rounds the most common of these bullets are made of small diameter lead pellets , placed in a thin copper shell and held in place by an epoxy or similar binding agent one interesting use of the sintered metal rounds is in shotguns in hostage rescue situations ; the sintered metal round is used at near-contact range to shoot the lock mechanism out of doors the concern is not depressurization ( a bullet hole will not depressurise an airliner ) , but over penetration and damage to vital electrical or hydraulic lines , or injury to an innocent bystander by a bullet that travels through a target 's body completely instead of stopping in the body they also produce a much larger diameter hole in comparison to a shaped charge and hence produce a far more extensive behind armour effect

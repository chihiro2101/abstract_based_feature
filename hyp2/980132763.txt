while the concepts of terminal ballistics can be applied to any projectile striking any target , much of the topic concerns the effects of small arms fire striking live targets and their ability to either incapacitate or kill them 380 acp jacketed hollow point for short range target shooting on ranges up to 50 meters ( 55 yd ) , aerodynamics are relatively unimportant and velocities are low since cutting the edge of a target ring will result in scoring the higher score , fractions of an inch are important for steel targets , the concern is to provide enough force to knock over the target while minimizing the damage to the target a soft lead bullet , or a jacketed hollow-point bullet or soft-point bullet will flatten out on impact ( if the velocity at impact is sufficient to make it deform ) , spreading the impact over a larger area of the target , allowing more total force to be applied without damaging the steel target there are also specialized bullets designed for use in long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles ; the designs vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer in 7.62×51mm nato , m852 match and m118lr ammunition are issued , both of which use sierra matchking bullets ; in 5.56×45mm nato , those u.s for ultra long range precision target shooting with high-powered rifles and military sniping , radically designed very-low-drag ( vld ) bullets are available that are generally produced out of rods of mono-metal alloys on cnc lathes focusing the largest amount of momentum on the smallest possible area of the target provides the greatest penetration bullets for maximum penetration are designed to resist deformation on impact , and usually are made of lead that is covered in a copper , brass , or mild steel jacket ( some are even solid copper or bronze alloy ) the jacket completely covers the front of the bullet , although often the rear is left with exposed lead ( this is a manufacturing consideration : the jacket is formed first , and the lead is swaged in from the rear ) military armor-piercing small arms ammunition is made from a copper-jacketed steel core ; the steel resists deformation better than the usual soft lead core leading to greater penetration the sabot is a light material that transfers the pressure of the charge to the penetrator , then is discarded when the round leaves the barrel the final category of bullets is that intended to control penetration so as not to harm anything behind the target such bullets are used primarily for hunting and civilian antipersonnel use ; they are not generally used by the military , since the use of expanding bullets in international conflicts is prohibited by the hague convention and because these bullets have less chance of penetrating modern body armor while a bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding , allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily , in some applications , preventing exit from the rear of the target is more desirable a perforating bullet can continue on ( likely not coaxial to the original trajectory due to target deflection ) and might cause unintended damage or injury this increases the effective surface area , as rounded bullets can allow tissues to '' flow '' around the edges flat-point bullets , with fronts of up to 90 % of the overall bullet diameter , are usually designed for use against large or dangerous game these bullets are designed to penetrate deeply through muscle and bone , while causing a wound channel of nearly the full diameter of the bullet the disadvantage of flat point bullets is the reduction in aerodynamic performance ; the flat point induces much drag , leading to significantly reduced velocities at long range the hollow point fills with body tissue and fluids on impact , then expands as the bullet continues to have matter pushed into it for the purposes of aerodynamic efficiency the tip of the hollowpoint will often be tipped with a pointed polymer 'nose ' which may also aid in expansion by functioning as a piston upon impact pushing the hollow point open penetration of the hollowpoint would be less than half that of a similar nonexpanding bullet , and the resulting wound or permanent cavity would be much wider these bullets are typically fired at high velocities to maximize their fragmentation upon impact also used are bullets similar to hollowpoint bullets or soft point bullets whose cores and/or jackets are deliberately weakened to cause deformation or fragmentation upon impact on impact , the epoxy shatters and the copper shell opens up , the individual lead balls then spread out in a wide pattern , and due to their low mass to surface area ratio , stop very quickly more rarely , others are used to release chemical or biological agents , either on impact or when over the target area ; designing an appropriate fuse is a difficult task which lies outside the realm of terminal ballistics the length of the penetrator is limited by the ability of the penetrator to withstand launch forces whilst in the bore and shear forces along its length at impact

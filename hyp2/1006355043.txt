the surname '' coke '' , or '' cocke '' , can be traced back to a william coke in the hundred of south greenhoe , now the norfolk town of swaffham , in around 1150 coke 's father , robert coke , was a barrister and bencher of lincoln 's inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of norfolk over time , he bought several manors at congham , west acre and happisburgh , all in norfolk , and was granted a coat of arms , becoming a minor member of the gentry her father and grandfather had practised law in the norfolk area , and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy , a lawyer and justice of the court of king 's bench with links to the earl of arundel winifred 's father later married agnes , the sister of nicholas hare the other seven were daughters – winifred , dorothy , elizabeth , ursula , anna , margaret and ethelreda – although it is not known in which order the children were born two years after robert coke died on 15 november 1561 , his widow married robert bozoun , a property trader noted for his piety and strong business acumen ( once forcing nicholas bacon to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a piece of property ) he had a tremendous influence on the coke children : from bozoun coke learnt to '' loathe concealers , prefer godly men and briskly do business with any willing client '' , something that shaped his future conduct as a lawyer , politician , and judge image : trinity college chapel , cambridge.jpg 288px thumb right trinity college , cambridge , where coke studied between 1567 and 1570 alt a photograph of the front of the chapel of trinity college the chapel itself is a white building with arches and large glass windows at the age of eight in 1560 , coke began studying at the norwich school little is known of his time at trinity , though he certainly studied rhetoric and dialectics under a program instituted in 1559 coke was proud of cambridge and the time he spent there , later saying in dr bonham 's case that cambridge and oxford were '' the eyes and soul of the realm , from whence religion , the humanities , and learning were richly diffused into all parts of the realm '' after leaving trinity college he travelled to london , where he became a member of clifford 's inn in 1571 this was to learn the basics of the law – the inns of chancery , including clifford 's inn , provided initial legal education before transfer to the inns of court , where one could be called to the bar and practise as a barrister students were educated through arguments and debates & nbsp ; – they would be given precedents and writs each day , discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions coke also studied various writs '' till they turned honey sweet on his tongue '' , and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to the inner temple on 24 april 1572 after six years at the inner temple he was called to the bar on 20 april 1578 , a remarkably fast rate of progress given the process of legal education at the time , which normally required eight years of study his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk his counsel had worked from an inaccurate english copy of the latin statute of scandalum magnatum which had mistranslated several passages , forcing them to start the case anew after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty during the 1580s , coke became intimately linked with the howard family , the duke of norfolk and earls of arundel his power base was his household , particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together coke 's uncle thomas gawdy had served as steward to the third duke of norfolk , and during the 1580s coke was employed by the howards to counter lawyers employed by the crown , who argued that the howards ' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th duke coke became involved in the now classic shelley 's case in 1581 , which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today ; the case also established coke 's reputation as an attorney and case reporter thanks to his work in their behalf , coke had earned the favour of the dukes of norfolk the political '' old guard '' began to change around the time coke became a member of parliament in 1592 the lord chief justice died and , according to custom the attorney general , john popham , succeeded him , with the solicitor general , thomas egerton , succeeding popham coke held the position only briefly ; by the time he returned from a tour of norfolk to discuss election strategy , he had been confirmed as speaker of the house of commons by the privy council , having been proposed by francis knollys and thomas heneage following his return to parliament as mp for norfolk the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced morice was placed under house arrest , and seven members of parliament were later arrested , but the bills remained in parliament they were defended by francis knollys , one of the few remaining puritan members of parliament , while other puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents on 10 april 1594 , coke was made attorney general for england and wales thanks to his partnership with the cecil family francis bacon , his rival , was supported by robert devereux , who waged a constant war against robert cecil for control of the english government the position of master of the rolls had become vacant in april 1593 , and coke was expected to be appointed according to convention ; bacon , therefore , would become attorney general coke was appointed in a time of particular difficulty ; besides famine and the conflict with spain , war had recently broken out in ireland devereux immediately began plotting rebellion against the backdrop of devereux 's plot , coke and cecil started a new investigation into the book , hoping to prove some involvement of devereux in the publishing coke interviewed hayward 's licensing cleric , samuel harsnett , who complained that the dedication had been '' foisted '' on him by devereux on 19 february he was tried for treason , along with the earl of southampton coke led the case for the government , and devereux was found guilty and executed ; the earl of southampton was reprieved james & nbsp ; vi of scotland set out to claim the english throne , taking the title james i , and the cokes immediately began ingratiating themselves with the new monarch and his family elizabeth hatton , coke 's wife , travelled to scotland to meet anne of denmark , the incoming queen , and '' the high-tempered beauty somehow pleased that withdrawn , strong-willed woman & nbsp ; the first of these was the trial of sir walter raleigh ; according to cuthbert william johnson , one of coke 's biographers , '' there is , perhaps , no reported case in which the proofs against the prisoner were weaker than in this trial & nbsp ; it supports the general charges in the indictment only by the vaguest possible reference to 'these practices , ' and 'plots and invasions ' of which no more is said '' until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law , he had no right to interpret it ; he pointed out that such knowledge '' demanded mastery of an artificial reason & nbsp ; coke was only saved from imprisonment by cecil , who pleaded with the king to show leniency , which he granted coke 's famous case of proclamations , and his speech there , was first brought into the public consciousness through its inclusion in volume & nbsp ; 12 of his reports , and roland g coke argued that the judges of the common law were those most suited to making law , followed by parliament , and that the monarch was bound to follow any legal rules the case of john lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid , but that there was a right to silence , drawing from coke 's decisions in reaching that conclusion the legal precept that no one may enter a home unless by invitation , was established as common law in coke ’ s institutes

– they would be given precedents and writs each day , discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions at the inner temple he began the second stage of his education , reading legal texts such as glanville 's treatises and taking part in moots after six years at the inner temple he was called to the bar on 20 april 1578 , a remarkably fast rate of progress given the process of legal education at the time , which normally required eight years of study his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk the case was a charge of slander against a mr denny , the vicar of northlinham and coke 's client the case was actually two actions , with the first judgement being given in denny 's favour after coke 's research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated cromwell 's case after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty the judge ruled that denny 's statement had indeed meant this , and from this position of strength coke forced a settlement in norfolk arundel held a liberty & nbsp ; – he was essentially a local prince who appointed all officials , maintained his own prison , executed justice and bribed any royal clerks thanks to his work in their behalf , coke had earned the favour of the dukes of norfolk with their support , coke was returned for aldeburgh as an mp in february 1589 the political '' old guard '' began to change around the time coke became a member of parliament this created a vacancy among the law officers of the crown , and thanks to the influence of the cecil family , coke became solicitor general on 16 june 1592 this was likely a narrow victory owing to coke 's defence of unpopular clients ; he was summoned before elizabeth i , who berated him until he cried before confirming him as solicitor general coke held the position only briefly ; by the time he returned from a tour of norfolk to discuss election strategy , he had been confirmed as speaker of the house of commons by the privy council , having been proposed by francis knollys and thomas heneage following his return to parliament as mp for norfolk after '' disabling '' himself in the house of lords ( a ceremony in which the incoming speaker apologised for his failings ) parliament was suspended until 24 february ; coke returned two days later , having suffered from a stomach problem the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced on 27 february james morice , a puritan member of parliament , proposed two new bills : one against the bishops of the church of england , and the other against the court of high commission morice was placed under house arrest , and seven members of parliament were later arrested , but the bills remained in parliament coke and cecil , the government 's two strongest defenders in parliament , made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills cecil first pointed out that the queen had forbidden bills on religion ; parliament ignored him , and the bill went ahead coke continued talking until the end of the parliamentary day in a filibuster action , granting a day of delay for the government immediately afterwards , coke was summoned by the queen , who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty the warning was accepted by the commons , and no more action was taken on the two puritan bills on 10 april 1594 , coke was made attorney general for england and wales thanks to his partnership with the cecil family coke was appointed in a time of particular difficulty ; besides famine and the conflict with spain , war had recently broken out in ireland coke primarily dealt with matters of treason , such as the cases of smythe baronets and edward squire as the 1590s continued , the infighting between cecil and devereux persisted , with devereux 's raid on cadiz earning him national fame while the members of the nobility wished to be gentle with devereux , the lawyers and judges felt differently , recommending fines and confinement in the tower of london who said one thing at one time , and another thing in another , and could be relied upon in nothing '' on 20 june 1606 , coke was made a serjeant-at-law , a requirement for his elevation to chief justice of the common pleas , which occurred on 30 june coke 's changed position from attorney general to chief justice allowed him to openly attack organisations he had previously supported his first target was the court of high commission , an ecclesiastical court established by the monarch with near unlimited power ; it administered a mandatory ex officio oath that deliberately trapped people the judges , particularly coke , began to unite with parliament in challenging the high commission coke 's jurisprudence centres on the hierarchy of the judges , the monarch , and parliament in making law john selden similarly thought that the common law was the proper law of england his work in slade 's case led to the rise of modern contract law , and his actions in the case of proclamations and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence coke was pedantic and technical , something which saw him win many cases as a barrister , but when he became attorney general '' he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form & nbsp ;

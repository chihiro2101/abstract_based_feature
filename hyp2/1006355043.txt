the surname '' coke '' , or '' cocke '' , can be traced back to a william coke in the hundred of south greenhoe , now the norfolk town of swaffham , in around 1150 another hypothesis is that it was an attempt to disguise the word '' cook '' coke 's father , robert coke , was a barrister and bencher of lincoln 's inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of norfolk over time , he bought several manors at congham , west acre and happisburgh , all in norfolk , and was granted a coat of arms , becoming a minor member of the gentry coke 's mother , winifred knightley , came from a family even more intimately linked with the law than her husband her father and grandfather had practised law in the norfolk area , and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy , a lawyer and justice of the court of king 's bench with links to the earl of arundel this connection later served edward well winifred 's father later married agnes , the sister of nicholas hare edward coke was born on 1 february 1552 in mileham , one of eight children he had a tremendous influence on the coke children : from bozoun coke learnt to '' loathe concealers , prefer godly men and briskly do business with any willing client '' , something that shaped his future conduct as a lawyer , politician , and judge image : trinity college chapel , cambridge.jpg 288px thumb right trinity college , cambridge , where coke studied between 1567 and 1570 alt a photograph of the front of the chapel of trinity college the students were taught rhetoric based on the rhetorica ad herennium , and greek centred on the works of homer and virgil his biographers felt he had all the intelligence to be a good student , though a record of his academic achievements has not been found bonham 's case that cambridge and oxford were '' the eyes and soul of the realm , from whence religion , the humanities , and learning were richly diffused into all parts of the realm this was to learn the basics of the law – the inns of chancery , including clifford 's inn , provided initial legal education before transfer to the inns of court , where one could be called to the bar and practise as a barrister students were educated through arguments and debates & nbsp ; – they would be given precedents and writs each day , discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions coke also studied various writs '' till they turned honey sweet on his tongue '' , and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to the inner temple on 24 april 1572 he took little interest in the theatrical performances or other cultural events at the inns , preferring to spend his time at the law courts in westminster hall , listening to the serjeants argue after six years at the inner temple he was called to the bar on 20 april 1578 , a remarkably fast rate of progress given the process of legal education at the time , which normally required eight years of study his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk the case was actually two actions , with the first judgement being given in denny 's favour after coke 's research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated cromwell 's case his counsel had worked from an inaccurate english copy of the latin statute of scandalum magnatum which had mistranslated several passages , forcing them to start the case anew after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty coke was very proud of his actions in this case and later described it in his reports as '' an excellent point of learning in actions of slander '' the next year he was elected reader of lyon 's inn for three years , something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in lord cromwell 's case during the 1580s , coke became intimately linked with the howard family , the duke of norfolk and earls of arundel coke 's uncle thomas gawdy had served as steward to the third duke of norfolk , and during the 1580s coke was employed by the howards to counter lawyers employed by the crown , who argued that the howards ' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th duke coke became involved in the now classic shelley 's case in 1581 , which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today ; the case also established coke 's reputation as an attorney and case reporter . solicitor general and speaker the earl of leicester died in 1588 , followed by walter mildmay , the chancellor of the exchequer , a year later , and francis walsingham a year after that in 1592 the lord chief justice died and , according to custom the attorney general , john popham , succeeded him , with the solicitor general , thomas egerton , succeeding popham this created a vacancy among the law officers of the crown , and thanks to the influence of the cecil family , coke became solicitor general on 16 june 1592 coke held the position only briefly ; by the time he returned from a tour of norfolk to discuss election strategy , he had been confirmed as speaker of the house of commons by the privy council , having been proposed by francis knollys and thomas heneage following his return to parliament as mp for norfolk coke held the positions of speaker and solicitor-general at the same time , although he did not take up his post as speaker until the state opening of parliament on 19 february 1593 ( despite being confirmed on 28 january 1593 ) the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced on 27 february james morice , a puritan member of parliament , proposed two new bills : one against the bishops of the church of england , and the other against the court of high commission they were defended by francis knollys , one of the few remaining puritan members of parliament , while other puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents cecil first pointed out that the queen had forbidden bills on religion ; parliament ignored him , and the bill went ahead coke , as speaker of the house of commons ( whose job was to schedule any bills ) , conducted a delaying campaign , first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee ; both suggestions were voted down by the commons coke continued talking until the end of the parliamentary day in a filibuster action , granting a day of delay for the government on 10 april 1594 , coke was made attorney general for england and wales thanks to his partnership with the cecil family the position of master of the rolls had become vacant in april 1593 , and coke was expected to be appointed according to convention ; bacon , therefore , would become attorney general the attorney general was the main prosecutor of the crown , expected to bring all charges on its behalf and serve as its legal advisor in any situation as the 1590s continued , the infighting between cecil and devereux persisted , with devereux 's raid on cadiz earning him national fame against the backdrop of devereux 's plot , coke and cecil started a new investigation into the book , hoping to prove some involvement of devereux in the publishing in reaction , coke decided to bring charges of treason against devereux , saying that he had '' plotted and practised with the pope and king of spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of england & nbsp ; a day later a group of emissaries led by thomas egerton and john popham were sent to devereux , and immediately taken hostage the judges , particularly coke , began to unite with parliament in challenging the high commission coke 's famous case of proclamations , and his speech there , was first brought into the public consciousness through its inclusion in volume & nbsp ; 12 of his reports , and roland g his work in slade 's case led to the rise of modern contract law , and his actions in the case of proclamations and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence coke was pedantic and technical , something which saw him win many cases as a barrister , but when he became attorney general '' he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form & nbsp ;

the surname '' coke '' , or '' cocke '' , can be traced back to a william coke in the hundred of south greenhoe , now the norfolk town of swaffham , in around 1150 coke 's father , robert coke , was a barrister and bencher of lincoln 's inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of norfolk her father and grandfather had practised law in the norfolk area , and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy , a lawyer and justice of the court of king 's bench with links to the earl of arundel the chapel itself is a white building with arches and large glass windows at the age of eight in 1560 , coke began studying at the norwich school coke was taught at norwich to value the '' forcefulness of freedom of speech '' , something he later applied as a judge after leaving norwich in 1567 he matriculated to trinity college , cambridge , where he studied for three years until the end of 1570 , when he left without gaining a degree little is known of his time at trinity , though he certainly studied rhetoric and dialectics under a program instituted in 1559 bonham 's case that cambridge and oxford were '' the eyes and soul of the realm , from whence religion , the humanities , and learning were richly diffused into all parts of the realm '' after leaving trinity college he travelled to london , where he became a member of clifford 's inn in 1571 students were educated through arguments and debates & nbsp ; – they would be given precedents and writs each day , discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions coke also studied various writs '' till they turned honey sweet on his tongue '' , and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to the inner temple on 24 april 1572 he took little interest in the theatrical performances or other cultural events at the inns , preferring to spend his time at the law courts in westminster hall , listening to the serjeants argue polson , a biographer of coke , suggests that this was due to his knowledge of the law , which '' excited the benchers '' his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk in a dispute with denny , cromwell had hired two unlicensed preachers to harass him , denounce the book of common prayer and preach the gospel in his area denny retorted by telling cromwell '' you like not of me , since you like those that maintain sedition '' the case was actually two actions , with the first judgement being given in denny 's favour after coke 's research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated cromwell 's case his counsel had worked from an inaccurate english copy of the latin statute of scandalum magnatum which had mistranslated several passages , forcing them to start the case anew after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty the judge ruled that denny 's statement had indeed meant this , and from this position of strength coke forced a settlement the next year he was elected reader of lyon 's inn for three years , something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in lord cromwell 's case in norfolk arundel held a liberty & nbsp ; – he was essentially a local prince who appointed all officials , maintained his own prison , executed justice and bribed any royal clerks thanks to his work in their behalf , coke had earned the favour of the dukes of norfolk the political '' old guard '' began to change around the time coke became a member of parliament in 1592 the lord chief justice died and , according to custom the attorney general , john popham , succeeded him , with the solicitor general , thomas egerton , succeeding popham on 27 february james morice , a puritan member of parliament , proposed two new bills : one against the bishops of the church of england , and the other against the court of high commission coke continued talking until the end of the parliamentary day in a filibuster action , granting a day of delay for the government immediately afterwards , coke was summoned by the queen , who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty on 10 april 1594 , coke was made attorney general for england and wales thanks to his partnership with the cecil family francis bacon , his rival , was supported by robert devereux , who waged a constant war against robert cecil for control of the english government he also handled religious incidents such as the disputes between the jesuits and the church of england , personally interrogating john gerard after his capture in the end a compromise was reached , with devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices devereux immediately began plotting rebellion in 1599 sir john hayward had written and published the first part of the life and raigne of king henrie iv , dedicating it to devereux against the backdrop of devereux 's plot , coke and cecil started a new investigation into the book , hoping to prove some involvement of devereux in the publishing in reaction , coke decided to bring charges of treason against devereux , saying that he had '' plotted and practised with the pope and king of spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of england & nbsp ; on 8 february 1601 devereux ordered his followers to meet at essex house after a failed attempt to garner support from the population of london , devereux found himself surrounded in essex house ; after burning his personal papers , he surrendered james & nbsp ; vi of scotland set out to claim the english throne , taking the title james i , and the cokes immediately began ingratiating themselves with the new monarch and his family elizabeth hatton , coke 's wife , travelled to scotland to meet anne of denmark , the incoming queen , and '' the high-tempered beauty somehow pleased that withdrawn , strong-willed woman & nbsp ; lady hatton and her husband would retain the queen 's affection and trust '' coke attended divine service with the new king on 22 may , who , following the service , took a sword from his bodyguard and knighted coke coke was reconfirmed as attorney general under james , and immediately found himself dealing with '' a series of treasons , whether real or imaginary '' the first of these was the trial of sir walter raleigh ; according to cuthbert william johnson , one of coke 's biographers , '' there is , perhaps , no reported case in which the proofs against the prisoner were weaker than in this trial & nbsp ; as such , raleigh was charged with supporting stuart 's claim to the throne and claiming spanish money he pleaded not guilty , with coke 's only evidence being a confession from cobham , who was described as '' a weak and unprincipled creature & nbsp ; who said one thing at one time , and another thing in another , and could be relied upon in nothing '' coke conducted the prosecution for the government – an easy one , since the conspirators had no legal representation – and through his speeches , '' blackened them in the eyes of the world '' coke , speaking for the judges , argued that the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was limited to cases where no temporal matters were involved and the rest left to the common law with his decision that common law courts could issue writs of prohibition against such oaths and his arguments that such oaths were contrary to the common law ( as found in his reports and institutes ) , coke '' dealt the crucial blow to the oath ex officio and to the high commission '' the case of john lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid , but that there was a right to silence , drawing from coke 's decisions in reaching that conclusion

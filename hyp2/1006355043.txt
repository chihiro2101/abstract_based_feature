the surname '' coke '' , or '' cocke '' , can be traced back to a william coke in the hundred of south greenhoe , now the norfolk town of swaffham , in around 1150 the family was relatively prosperous and influential – members from the 14th century onwards included an under-sheriff , a knight banneret , a barrister and a merchant coke 's father , robert coke , was a barrister and bencher of lincoln 's inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of norfolk her father and grandfather had practised law in the norfolk area , and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy , a lawyer and justice of the court of king 's bench with links to the earl of arundel the other seven were daughters – winifred , dorothy , elizabeth , ursula , anna , margaret and ethelreda – although it is not known in which order the children were born two years after robert coke died on 15 november 1561 , his widow married robert bozoun , a property trader noted for his piety and strong business acumen ( once forcing nicholas bacon to pay an exorbitant amount of money for a piece of property ) he had a tremendous influence on the coke children : from bozoun coke learnt to '' loathe concealers , prefer godly men and briskly do business with any willing client '' , something that shaped his future conduct as a lawyer , politician , and judge image : trinity college chapel , cambridge.jpg 288px thumb right trinity college , cambridge , where coke studied between 1567 and 1570 alt a photograph of the front of the chapel of trinity college the chapel itself is a white building with arches and large glass windows at the age of eight in 1560 , coke began studying at the norwich school coke was taught at norwich to value the '' forcefulness of freedom of speech '' , something he later applied as a judge little is known of his time at trinity , though he certainly studied rhetoric and dialectics under a program instituted in 1559 coke was proud of cambridge and the time he spent there , later saying in dr this was to learn the basics of the law – the inns of chancery , including clifford 's inn , provided initial legal education before transfer to the inns of court , where one could be called to the bar and practise as a barrister he took little interest in the theatrical performances or other cultural events at the inns , preferring to spend his time at the law courts in westminster hall , listening to the serjeants argue after being called to the bar on 20 april 1578 coke immediately began practising as a barrister his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk the case was a charge of slander against a mr denny , the vicar of northlinham and coke 's client after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty coke was very proud of his actions in this case and later described it in his reports as '' an excellent point of learning in actions of slander '' as reader he was tasked with reading to the students at the inn , a group that numbered about thirty at any one time , and the quality of his readings increased his reputation even further his power base was his household , particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together coke 's uncle thomas gawdy had served as steward to the third duke of norfolk , and during the 1580s coke was employed by the howards to counter lawyers employed by the crown , who argued that the howards ' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th duke the political '' old guard '' began to change around the time coke became a member of parliament this was likely a narrow victory owing to coke 's defence of unpopular clients ; he was summoned before elizabeth i , who berated him until he cried before confirming him as solicitor general coke held the position only briefly ; by the time he returned from a tour of norfolk to discuss election strategy , he had been confirmed as speaker of the house of commons by the privy council , having been proposed by francis knollys and thomas heneage following his return to parliament as mp for norfolk coke held the positions of speaker and solicitor-general at the same time , although he did not take up his post as speaker until the state opening of parliament on 19 february 1593 ( despite being confirmed on 28 january 1593 ) after '' disabling '' himself in the house of lords ( a ceremony in which the incoming speaker apologised for his failings ) parliament was suspended until 24 february ; coke returned two days later , having suffered from a stomach problem the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced the taxes were paramount ; subsidies collected in 1589 had been spent , and the war continued morice was placed under house arrest , and seven members of parliament were later arrested , but the bills remained in parliament coke and cecil , the government 's two strongest defenders in parliament , made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills cecil first pointed out that the queen had forbidden bills on religion ; parliament ignored him , and the bill went ahead coke , as speaker of the house of commons ( whose job was to schedule any bills ) , conducted a delaying campaign , first suggesting that the bill was too long to be read in the morning and then that it be delegated to a committee ; both suggestions were voted down by the commons coke continued talking until the end of the parliamentary day in a filibuster action , granting a day of delay for the government immediately afterwards , coke was summoned by the queen , who made it clear that any action on the bills would be considered evidence of disloyalty the warning was accepted by the commons , and no more action was taken on the two puritan bills the position of master of the rolls had become vacant in april 1593 , and coke was expected to be appointed according to convention ; bacon , therefore , would become attorney general in march 1599 devereux was sent to defeat the growing rebellion in ireland and was given command of 18,000 & nbsp ; men , but by november his army was reduced to 4,000 , the rest '' frittered away '' in exchange for '' conquering nothing '' on 5 june 1600 he faced a panel of privy councillors , judges and members of the nobility at york house , where he was charged with appointing generals without the queen 's permission , ignoring orders and negotiating '' very basely '' with the leader of the rebel forces against the backdrop of devereux 's plot , coke and cecil started a new investigation into the book , hoping to prove some involvement of devereux in the publishing coke interviewed hayward 's licensing cleric , samuel harsnett , who complained that the dedication had been '' foisted '' on him by devereux in reaction , coke decided to bring charges of treason against devereux , saying that he had '' plotted and practised with the pope and king of spain for the deposing and selling of himself as well as the crown of england & nbsp ; a day later a group of emissaries led by thomas egerton and john popham were sent to devereux , and immediately taken hostage after a failed attempt to garner support from the population of london , devereux found himself surrounded in essex house ; after burning his personal papers , he surrendered some assert that coke became chief justice due to his prosecutions of raleigh and the gunpowder plot conspirators , but there is no evidence to support this ; instead , it was traditional at the time that a retiring chief justice would be replaced with the attorney general coke began reporting cases in the traditional manner , by copying out and repeating cases found in earlier law reports , such as those of edmund plowden while the reports were intended to give an explanation of the law chronologically , coke 's purpose was to provide an english language tutorial for students studying law at the inns of court this served as an alternative to the roman law lectures at university , which were based on latin ; according to bowen , it was '' a double vision ; the institutes as authority , the reports as illustration by actual practise '' hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers , and that the law could be understood not through coke 's '' reason '' ( the method used by lawyers ) , but through understanding the king 's instructions his work in slade 's case led to the rise of modern contract law , and his actions in the case of proclamations and the other pleadings which led to his eventual dismissal went some way towards securing judicial independence coke was pedantic and technical , something which saw him win many cases as a barrister , but when he became attorney general '' he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form & nbsp ;

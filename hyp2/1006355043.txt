the surname '' coke '' , or '' cocke '' , can be traced back to a william coke in the hundred of south greenhoe , now the norfolk town of swaffham , in around 1150 the family was relatively prosperous and influential – members from the 14th century onwards included an under-sheriff , a knight banneret , a barrister and a merchant coke 's father , robert coke , was a barrister and bencher of lincoln 's inn who built up a strong practice representing clients from his home area of norfolk over time , he bought several manors at congham , west acre and happisburgh , all in norfolk , and was granted a coat of arms , becoming a minor member of the gentry coke 's mother , winifred knightley , came from a family even more intimately linked with the law than her husband her father and grandfather had practised law in the norfolk area , and her sister audrey was married to thomas gawdy , a lawyer and justice of the court of king 's bench with links to the earl of arundel edward coke was born on 1 february 1552 in mileham , one of eight children the other seven were daughters – winifred , dorothy , elizabeth , ursula , anna , margaret and ethelreda – although it is not known in which order the children were born image : trinity college chapel , cambridge.jpg 288px thumb right trinity college , cambridge , where coke studied between 1567 and 1570 alt a photograph of the front of the chapel of trinity college the students were taught rhetoric based on the rhetorica ad herennium , and greek centred on the works of homer and virgil coke was taught at norwich to value the '' forcefulness of freedom of speech '' , something he later applied as a judge his biographers felt he had all the intelligence to be a good student , though a record of his academic achievements has not been found coke was proud of cambridge and the time he spent there , later saying in dr students were educated through arguments and debates & nbsp ; – they would be given precedents and writs each day , discuss them at the dinner table and then argue a moot court based on those precedents and their discussions coke also studied various writs '' till they turned honey sweet on his tongue '' , and after completing this stage of his legal education transferred to the inner temple on 24 april 1572 polson , a biographer of coke , suggests that this was due to his knowledge of the law , which '' excited the benchers '' after being called to the bar on 20 april 1578 coke immediately began practising as a barrister his first case was in the court of king 's bench in 1581 , and was known as lord cromwell 's case after the claimant , lord henry cromwell , a landlord in coke 's home county of norfolk the case was a charge of slander against a mr denny , the vicar of northlinham and coke 's client in a dispute with denny , cromwell had hired two unlicensed preachers to harass him , denounce the book of common prayer and preach the gospel in his area after the case was restarted , coke argued that denny had commented on cromwell 's support of people attacking the book of common prayer , and was not implying any deeper disloyalty the judge ruled that denny 's statement had indeed meant this , and from this position of strength coke forced a settlement the next year he was elected reader of lyon 's inn for three years , something surprising considering his young age and likely related to his conduct in lord cromwell 's case as reader he was tasked with reading to the students at the inn , a group that numbered about thirty at any one time , and the quality of his readings increased his reputation even further in norfolk arundel held a liberty & nbsp ; – he was essentially a local prince who appointed all officials , maintained his own prison , executed justice and bribed any royal clerks his power base was his household , particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together coke became involved in the now classic shelley 's case in 1581 , which created a rule in real property that is still used in some common law jurisdictions today ; the case also established coke 's reputation as an attorney and case reporter the political '' old guard '' began to change around the time coke became a member of parliament this created a vacancy among the law officers of the crown , and thanks to the influence of the cecil family , coke became solicitor general on 16 june 1592 this was likely a narrow victory owing to coke 's defence of unpopular clients ; he was summoned before elizabeth i , who berated him until he cried before confirming him as solicitor general the parliament was intended to be a brief and simple one ; with the black death resurgent throughout england and the threat of spain on the horizon , the only matter was to impose certain taxes to fund the queen 's campaign against the spanish , with no bills to be introduced the idea of a calm , swift parliament foundered on the rocks of religious conflict on 27 february james morice , a puritan member of parliament , proposed two new bills : one against the bishops of the church of england , and the other against the court of high commission morice was placed under house arrest , and seven members of parliament were later arrested , but the bills remained in parliament they were defended by francis knollys , one of the few remaining puritan members of parliament , while other puritans spat and coughed to drown out speeches by opponents coke and cecil , the government 's two strongest defenders in parliament , made several efforts to put off or end the debate over the bills cecil first pointed out that the queen had forbidden bills on religion ; parliament ignored him , and the bill went ahead coke continued talking until the end of the parliamentary day in a filibuster action , granting a day of delay for the government the warning was accepted by the commons , and no more action was taken on the two puritan bills the position of master of the rolls had become vacant in april 1593 , and coke was expected to be appointed according to convention ; bacon , therefore , would become attorney general the attorney general was the main prosecutor of the crown , expected to bring all charges on its behalf and serve as its legal advisor in any situation coke primarily dealt with matters of treason , such as the cases of smythe baronets and edward squire as the 1590s continued , the infighting between cecil and devereux persisted , with devereux 's raid on cadiz earning him national fame in march 1599 devereux was sent to defeat the growing rebellion in ireland and was given command of 18,000 & nbsp ; men , but by november his army was reduced to 4,000 , the rest '' frittered away '' in exchange for '' conquering nothing '' in the end a compromise was reached , with devereux put under house arrest and dismissed from all his government offices in response , coke and cecil began a counter-plot elizabeth , furious , had banned the book , suggesting that it was a '' seditious prelude '' intended to show her as a corrupt and poor monarch the work was first printed in an american edition in 1812 , by which point the english version was in its sixteenth edition , and had been commented on itself by various later legal authorities the case of john lilburne later confirmed that not only was such an oath invalid , but that there was a right to silence , drawing from coke 's decisions in reaching that conclusion the legal precept that no one may enter a home unless by invitation , was established as common law in coke ’ s institutes coke was pedantic and technical , something which saw him win many cases as a barrister , but when he became attorney general '' he showed the same qualities in a less pleasing form & nbsp ;

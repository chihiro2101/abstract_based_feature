born at no.17h rue de l'arbre à poires ( now rue sadi-carnot ) in cambrai , elliott 2000 , p louis was the first of five children born to clémence and charles blériot in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing after passing the exams for his baccalaureate in science and german , he determined to try to enter the prestigious école centrale in paris entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability after three years of demanding study at the école centrale , blériot graduated 113th of 203 in his graduating class the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day in october 1900 blériot was lunching in his usual restaurant near his showroom when his eye was caught by a young woman dining with her parents a bribe to a waiter secured details of her identity ; she was alice védères , the daughter of a retired army officer blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he would later bring to his aviation experiments , and on 21 february 1901 the couple were married by then his headlamp business was doing well enough for blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation in april 1905 , blériot met gabriel voisin , then employed by ernest archdeacon to assist with his experimental gliders on 18 july an attempt to fly this aircraft was made , ending in a crash in which voisin nearly drowned , but this did not deter blériot active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor blériot became a shareholder in the company , and in may 1906 , joined the board of directors the blériot iv was damaged in a taxiing accident at bagatelle on 12 november 1906 the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres the partnership with voisin was dissolved and blériot established his own business , recherches aéronautiques louis blériot , where he started creating his own aircraft , experimenting with various configurations sanger 2008 , pp two further ground trials , also damaging the aircraft , were undertaken , followed by another attempt on 5 april more trials followed , the last on 19 april when , travelling at a speed of around 50 km/h ( 30 & nbsp ; mph ) , the aircraft left the ground , blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise , and the machine hit the ground nose–first , and somersaulted this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) this was blériot 's first truly successful flight further successful flights took place that month , and by 25 july he had managed a flight of 150 & nbsp ; m ( 490 & nbsp ; ft ) in desperation blériot climbed out of his seat and threw himself towards the tail on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control , this was a failure in its first form after modifications , it proved successful , and on 31 october 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight , making a round trip from toury to arteny and back , a total distance of this was not the first cross-country flight by a narrow margin , since henri farman had flown from bouy to rheims the preceding day the type xi was initially powered by a rep engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 january 1909 , sanger 2008 , p the combination of a reliable engine and an efficient propeller would contribute greatly to the success of the type xi this was shortly followed by the blériot xii , a high-wing two-seater monoplane first flown on 21 may , and for a while blériot concentrated on flying this machine , flying it with a passenger on 2 july , and on 12 july making the world 's first flight with two passengers , one of whom was santos dumont after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight on 16 june 1909 , blériot and voisin were jointly awarded the prix osiris , '' prix osiris awarded to aviation the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year blériot , who intended to fly across the channel in his type xi monoplane , had three rivals for the prize , the most serious being hubert latham , a french national of english extraction flying an antoinette iv monoplane de lambert got as far as establishing a base at wissant , near calais , but seymour did nothing beyond submitting his entry to the daily mail orville , then recuperating from serious injuries sustained in a crash , replied telling him not to make the channel attempt until he could come to france and assist also wilbur had already amassed a fortune in prize money for altitude and duration flights and had secured sales contracts for the wright flyer with the french , italians , british and germans ; his tour in europe was essentially complete by the summer of 1909 in 1913 , a consortium led by blériot bought the société pour l'aviation et ses dérivés aircraft manufacturer and he became the president of the company in 1914 realising that a british company would have more chance to sell his models to the british government , in 1915 , he set up the blériot manufacturing aircraft company ltd blériot remained active in the aviation business until his death on 1 august 1936 in paris due to a heart attack on 25 july 2009 , the centenary of the original channel crossing , frenchman edmond salis took off from sangatte in a replica of bleriot 's aircraft

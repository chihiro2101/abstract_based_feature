louis was the first of five children born to clémence and charles blériot in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability after three years of demanding study at the école centrale , blériot graduated 113th of 203 in his graduating class he left the company after developing the world 's first practical headlamp for automobiles , using a compact integral acetylene generator in 1897 , blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de richlieu in paris a bribe to a waiter secured details of her identity ; she was alice védères , the daughter of a retired army officer blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he would later bring to his aviation experiments , and on 21 february 1901 the couple were married blériot had become interested in aviation while at the ecole centrale , but his serious experimentation was probably sparked by seeing clément ader 's avion iii at the 1900 exposition universelle by then his headlamp business was doing well enough for blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation in april 1905 , blériot met gabriel voisin , then employed by ernest archdeacon to assist with his experimental gliders blériot was a spectator at voisin 's first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on 8 june 1905 cine photography was among blériot 's hobbies , and the film footage of this flight was shot by him active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor both these aircraft were powered with the lightweight antoinette engines being developed by léon levavasseur blériot became a shareholder in the company , and in may 1906 , joined the board of directors the blériot iv was damaged in a taxiing accident at bagatelle on 12 november 1906 the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres this also took place at bagatelle , and was witnessed by blériot the partnership with voisin was dissolved and blériot established his own business , recherches aéronautiques louis blériot , where he started creating his own aircraft , experimenting with various configurations sanger 2008 , pp the flight was only of around 6 & nbsp ; m ( 20 & nbsp ; ft ) , after which he cut his engine and landed , slightly damaging the undercarriage more trials followed , the last on 19 april when , travelling at a speed of around 50 km/h ( 30 & nbsp ; mph ) , the aircraft left the ground , blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise , and the machine hit the ground nose–first , and somersaulted the aircraft was largely destroyed , but blériot was , by great good fortune , unhurt blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) this was blériot 's first truly successful flight further successful flights took place that month , and by 25 july he had managed a flight of 150 & nbsp ; m ( 490 & nbsp ; ft ) this , the blériot vii , was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become , apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control , the modern conventional layout on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn two more successful flights were made on 18 december , but the undercarriage collapsed after the second flight ; the aircraft overturned and was wrecked after modifications , it proved successful , and on 31 october 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight , making a round trip from toury to arteny and back , a total distance of four days later , the aircraft was destroyed in a taxiing accident the type xi was initially powered by a rep engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 january 1909 , sanger 2008 , p blériot 's determination is shown by the fact that during the flight at douai made on 2 july part of the asbestos insulation worked loose from the exhaust pipe after 15 minutes in the air after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight blériot suffered third-degree burns , and his injuries took over two months to heal the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year '' daily universal register , issue 8 , january 1785 , p the others were charles de lambert , a russian aristocrat with french ancestry , and one of wilbur wright 's pupils , and arthur seymour , an englishman who reputedly owned a voisin biplane ) now this investment began to pay off : orders for copies of the type xi quickly came , and by the end of the year , orders for over 100 aircraft had been received , each selling for 10,000 francs in 1913 , a consortium led by blériot bought the société pour l'aviation et ses dérivés aircraft manufacturer and he became the president of the company in 1914 realising that a british company would have more chance to sell his models to the british government , in 1915 , he set up the blériot manufacturing aircraft company ltd in 2002 british train company virgin crosscountry named class 221 221101 louis blériot blériot aéronautique early flying machines list of firsts in aviation

born at no.17h rue de l'arbre à poires ( now rue sadi-carnot ) in cambrai , elliott 2000 , p louis was the first of five children born to clémence and charles blériot in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability after three years of demanding study at the école centrale , blériot graduated 113th of 203 in his graduating class he left the company after developing the world 's first practical headlamp for automobiles , using a compact integral acetylene generator in 1897 , blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de richlieu in paris the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day in october 1900 blériot was lunching in his usual restaurant near his showroom when his eye was caught by a young woman dining with her parents blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he would later bring to his aviation experiments , and on 21 february 1901 the couple were married blériot had become interested in aviation while at the ecole centrale , but his serious experimentation was probably sparked by seeing clément ader 's avion iii at the 1900 exposition universelle by then his headlamp business was doing well enough for blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation cine photography was among blériot 's hobbies , and the film footage of this flight was shot by him on 18 july an attempt to fly this aircraft was made , ending in a crash in which voisin nearly drowned , but this did not deter blériot voisin accepted the proposal , and the two men established the ateliers d ' aviation edouard surcouf , blériot et voisin active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor the blériot iv was damaged in a taxiing accident at bagatelle on 12 november 1906 this also took place at bagatelle , and was witnessed by blériot the first of these , the canard ( aeronautics ) blériot v , was first tried on 21 march 1907 , elliott 2000 , p the aircraft was largely destroyed , but blériot was , by great good fortune , unhurt this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) further successful flights took place that month , and by 25 july he had managed a flight of 150 & nbsp ; m ( 490 & nbsp ; ft ) this , the blériot vii , was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become , apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control , the modern conventional layout this aircraft , which first flew on 16 november 1907 , has been recognised as the first successful monoplane on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control , this was a failure in its first form this was not the first cross-country flight by a narrow margin , since henri farman had flown from bouy to rheims the preceding day the first two of the designs , which used antoinette engines , never flew , possibly because at this time , blériot severed his connection with the antoinette company because the company had begun to design and construct aircraft as well as engines , presenting blériot with a conflict of interests the type xi was initially powered by a rep engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 january 1909 , sanger 2008 , p on 25 june he made a flight lasting 15 minutes and 30 seconds , his longest to date , and the following day increased this personal record to over 36 minutes blériot 's determination is shown by the fact that during the flight at douai made on 2 july part of the asbestos insulation worked loose from the exhaust pipe after 15 minutes in the air blériot suffered third-degree burns , and his injuries took over two months to heal three days later , on 19 july , he informed the daily mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the english channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year '' daily universal register , issue 8 , january 1785 , p the others were charles de lambert , a russian aristocrat with french ancestry , and one of wilbur wright 's pupils , and arthur seymour , an englishman who reputedly owned a voisin biplane de lambert got as far as establishing a base at wissant , near calais , but seymour did nothing beyond submitting his entry to the daily mail orville , then recuperating from serious injuries sustained in a crash , replied telling him not to make the channel attempt until he could come to france and assist hallion ; c.1978 by the smithsonian institution latham arrived in calais in early july , and set up his base at sangatte in the semi-derelict buildings which had been constructed for a 1881 attempt to dig a tunnel under the channel blériot monoplanes and voisin-type biplanes , with the latter 's farman derivatives dominated the pre-war aviation market murphy , navigator major eugene moses , and weapons systems officer first lieutenant david f on 25 july 2009 , the centenary of the original channel crossing , frenchman edmond salis took off from sangatte in a replica of bleriot 's aircraft

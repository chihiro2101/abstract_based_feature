louis was the first of five children born to clémence and charles blériot in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability he left the company after developing the world 's first practical headlamp for automobiles , using a compact integral acetylene generator in 1897 , blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de richlieu in paris the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day in october 1900 blériot was lunching in his usual restaurant near his showroom when his eye was caught by a young woman dining with her parents blériot was a spectator at voisin 's first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on 8 june 1905 the success of these trials prompted him to commission a similar machine from voisin , the blériot ii glider on 18 july an attempt to fly this aircraft was made , ending in a crash in which voisin nearly drowned , but this did not deter blériot indeed , he suggested that voisin should stop working for archdeacon and enter into partnership with him both these aircraft were powered with the lightweight antoinette engines being developed by léon levavasseur the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres this also took place at bagatelle , and was witnessed by blériot and eventually creating the world 's first successful powered monoplane when blériot limited his experiments to ground runs , which resulted in damage to the undercarriage two further ground trials , also damaging the aircraft , were undertaken , followed by another attempt on 5 april the flight was only of around 6 & nbsp ; m ( 20 & nbsp ; ft ) , after which he cut his engine and landed , slightly damaging the undercarriage the aircraft was largely destroyed , but blériot was , by great good fortune , unhurt this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) this was blériot 's first truly successful flight tests on 17 september showed a startling improvement in performance : the aircraft quickly reached an altitude of 25 & nbsp ; m ( 82 & nbsp ; ft ) , when the engine suddenly cut out and the aircraft went into a spiralling nosedive his only injuries were some minor cuts on the face , caused by fragments of glass from his broken goggles this aircraft , which first flew on 16 november 1907 , has been recognised as the first successful monoplane on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn two more successful flights were made on 18 december , but the undercarriage collapsed after the second flight ; the aircraft overturned and was wrecked blériot 's next aircraft , the blériot viii was shown to the press in february 1908 after modifications , it proved successful , and on 31 october 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight , making a round trip from toury to arteny and back , a total distance of this was not the first cross-country flight by a narrow margin , since henri farman had flown from bouy to rheims the preceding day three of his aircraft were displayed at the first paris aero salon , held at the end of december : the blériot ix monoplane ; the blériot x , a three-seat pusher biplane ; and the blériot xi , which would go on to be his most successful model after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight blériot suffered third-degree burns , and his injuries took over two months to heal on 16 june 1909 , blériot and voisin were jointly awarded the prix osiris , '' prix osiris awarded to aviation awarded by the institut de france every three years to the frenchman who had made the greatest contribution to science three days later , on 19 july , he informed the daily mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the english channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year the crowds were in for a wait : the weather was windy , and latham did not make an attempt until 19 & nbsp ; july , but from his destination his aircraft developed engine trouble and was forced to make the world 's first water landing in distress the following day a replacement aircraft for latham was delivered from the antoinette factory blériot 's success brought about an immediate transformation of the status of recherches aéronautiques louis blériot at the end of august , blériot was one of the flyers at the grande semaine d'aviation held at reims , where he was narrowly beaten by glenn curtiss in the first gordon bennett trophy in 1927 , blériot , long retired from flying , was present to welcome charles lindbergh when he landed at le bourget field completing his transatlantic flight the blériot trophy winning crew took over the aircraft for the return flight , but were all killed when the pilot lost control shortly after takeoff from the paris air show when he lost control during some attempted impromptu aerobatics

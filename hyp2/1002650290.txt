louis was the first of five children born to clémence and charles blériot in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing after passing the exams for his baccalaureate in science and german , he determined to try to enter the prestigious école centrale in paris entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability after three years of demanding study at the école centrale , blériot graduated 113th of 203 in his graduating class the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he would later bring to his aviation experiments , and on 21 february 1901 the couple were married blériot had become interested in aviation while at the ecole centrale , but his serious experimentation was probably sparked by seeing clément ader 's avion iii at the 1900 exposition universelle by then his headlamp business was doing well enough for blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation his first experiments were with a series of ornithopters , which were unsuccessful blériot was a spectator at voisin 's first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on 8 june 1905 on 18 july an attempt to fly this aircraft was made , ending in a crash in which voisin nearly drowned , but this did not deter blériot voisin accepted the proposal , and the two men established the ateliers d ' aviation edouard surcouf , blériot et voisin active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor both these aircraft were powered with the lightweight antoinette engines being developed by léon levavasseur and eventually creating the world 's first successful powered monoplane the first of these , the canard ( aeronautics ) blériot v , was first tried on 21 march 1907 , elliott 2000 , p two further ground trials , also damaging the aircraft , were undertaken , followed by another attempt on 5 april the flight was only of around 6 & nbsp ; m ( 20 & nbsp ; ft ) , after which he cut his engine and landed , slightly damaging the undercarriage the engine of the aircraft was immediately behind his seat , and he was very lucky not to have been crushed by it this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) this was blériot 's first truly successful flight he then fitted a 50 & nbsp ; hp ( 37 & nbsp ; kw ) v-16 antoinette engine the aircraft partially pulled out of the dive , and came to earth in a more or less horizontal attitude after this crash blériot abandoned the aircraft , concentrating on his next machine this , the blériot vii , was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become , apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control , the modern conventional layout on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn blériot 's next aircraft , the blériot viii was shown to the press in february 1908 although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control , this was a failure in its first form this was not the first cross-country flight by a narrow margin , since henri farman had flown from bouy to rheims the preceding day three of his aircraft were displayed at the first paris aero salon , held at the end of december : the blériot ix monoplane ; the blériot x , a three-seat pusher biplane ; and the blériot xi , which would go on to be his most successful model the type xi was initially powered by a rep engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 january 1909 , sanger 2008 , p this was shortly followed by the blériot xii , a high-wing two-seater monoplane first flown on 21 may , and for a while blériot concentrated on flying this machine , flying it with a passenger on 2 july , and on 12 july making the world 's first flight with two passengers , one of whom was santos dumont engine broke , and blériot resumed trials of the type xi blériot 's determination is shown by the fact that during the flight at douai made on 2 july part of the asbestos insulation worked loose from the exhaust pipe after 15 minutes in the air after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year his spirits revived , however , and by half past three , his wife alice had been put on board the destroyer escopette , which was to escort the flight between 1909 and the outbreak of world war i in 1914 , blériot produced about 900 aircraft , most of them variations of the type xi model from 1913 or earlier , janes 1913 blériot 's aviation activities were handled by blériot aéronautique , based at suresnes , which continued to design and produce aircraft up to the nationalisation of most of the french aircraft industry in 1937 , when it was absorbed into sncaso blériot remained active in the aviation business until his death on 1 august 1936 in paris due to a heart attack the medal may be awarded up to three times a year to record setters in speed , altitude and distance categories in light aircraft , and is still being awarded

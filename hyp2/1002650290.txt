louis was the first of five children born to clémence and charles blériot in 1882 , aged 10 , blériot was sent as a boarder to the institut notre dame in cambrai , where he frequently won class prizes , including one for engineering drawing entrance was by a demanding exam for which special tuition was necessary : consequently blériot spent a year at the collège sainte-barbe in paris he passed the exam , placing 74th among the 243 successful candidates , and doing especially well in the tests of engineering drawing ability he later got a job with baguès , an electrical engineering company in paris he left the company after developing the world 's first practical headlamp for automobiles , using a compact integral acetylene generator in 1897 , blériot opened a showroom for headlamps at 41 rue de richlieu in paris the business was successful , and soon he was supplying his lamps to both renault and panhard-levassor , two of the foremost automobile manufacturers of the day in october 1900 blériot was lunching in his usual restaurant near his showroom when his eye was caught by a young woman dining with her parents blériot set about courting her with the same determination that he would later bring to his aviation experiments , and on 21 february 1901 the couple were married by then his headlamp business was doing well enough for blériot to be able to devote both time and money to experimentation in april 1905 , blériot met gabriel voisin , then employed by ernest archdeacon to assist with his experimental gliders blériot was a spectator at voisin 's first trials of the floatplane glider he had built on 8 june 1905 active between 1905 and 1906 , the company built two unsuccessful powered aircraft , the blériot iii and the blériot iv , largely a rebuild of its predecessor both these aircraft were powered with the lightweight antoinette engines being developed by léon levavasseur the disappointment of the failure of his aircraft was compounded by the success of alberto santos dumont later that day , when he managed to fly his 14-bis a distance of , winning the aéro club de france prize for the first flight of over 100 metres the partnership with voisin was dissolved and blériot established his own business , recherches aéronautiques louis blériot , where he started creating his own aircraft , experimenting with various configurations sanger 2008 , pp the first of these , the canard ( aeronautics ) blériot v , was first tried on 21 march 1907 , elliott 2000 , p more trials followed , the last on 19 april when , travelling at a speed of around 50 km/h ( 30 & nbsp ; mph ) , the aircraft left the ground , blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise , and the machine hit the ground nose–first , and somersaulted this was followed by the blériot vi , a tandem wing design , first tested on 7 july , when the aircraft failed to lift off blériot then enlarged the wings slightly , and on 11 july a short successful flight of around 25–30 metres ( 84–100 & nbsp ; ft ) was made , reaching an altitude of around 2 & nbsp ; m ( 7 & nbsp ; ft ) on 6 august he managed to reach an altitude of 12 & nbsp ; m ( 39 & nbsp ; ft ) , but one of the blades of the propeller worked loose , resulting in a heavy landing which damaged the aircraft tests on 17 september showed a startling improvement in performance : the aircraft quickly reached an altitude of 25 & nbsp ; m ( 82 & nbsp ; ft ) , when the engine suddenly cut out and the aircraft went into a spiralling nosedive the aircraft partially pulled out of the dive , and came to earth in a more or less horizontal attitude this , the blériot vii , was a monoplane with tail surfaces arranged in what has become , apart from its use of differential elevators movement for lateral control , the modern conventional layout this aircraft , which first flew on 16 november 1907 , has been recognised as the first successful monoplane on 6 december blériot managed two flights of over 500 metres , including a successful u-turn two more successful flights were made on 18 december , but the undercarriage collapsed after the second flight ; the aircraft overturned and was wrecked blériot 's next aircraft , the blériot viii was shown to the press in february 1908 although it was the first to use of a successful combination of hand/arm-operated joystick and foot-operated rudder control , this was a failure in its first form after modifications , it proved successful , and on 31 october 1908 he succeeded in making a cross-country flight , making a round trip from toury to arteny and back , a total distance of the type xi was initially powered by a rep engine and was first flown with this engine on 18 january 1909 , sanger 2008 , p blériot 's determination is shown by the fact that during the flight at douai made on 2 july part of the asbestos insulation worked loose from the exhaust pipe after 15 minutes in the air after half an hour , one of his shoes had been burnt through and he was in considerable pain , but nevertheless continued his flight until engine failure ended the flight blériot suffered third-degree burns , and his injuries took over two months to heal on 16 june 1909 , blériot and voisin were jointly awarded the prix osiris , '' prix osiris awarded to aviation awarded by the institut de france every three years to the frenchman who had made the greatest contribution to science three days later , on 19 july , he informed the daily mail of his intention to make an attempt to win the thousand-pound prize offered by the paper for a successful crossing of the english channel in a heavier-than-air aircraft the daily mail prize was first announced in october 1908 , with a prize of £500 being offered for a flight made before the end of the year the daily mail correspondent , realising that blériot had landed near the castle , set off at speed in a motor car and took blériot to the harbour , where he was reunited with his wife in 1927 , blériot , long retired from flying , was present to welcome charles lindbergh when he landed at le bourget field completing his transatlantic flight in 1936 the fédération aéronautique internationale established the '' louis blériot medal '' in his honor on 25 july 2009 , the centenary of the original channel crossing , frenchman edmond salis took off from sangatte in a replica of bleriot 's aircraft in 2002 british train company virgin crosscountry named class 221 221101 louis blériot

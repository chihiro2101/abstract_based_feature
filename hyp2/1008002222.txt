in roman mythology , saturn was an agricultural deity who was said to have reigned over the world in the golden age , when humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in a state of innocence the revelries of saturnalia were supposed to reflect the conditions of the lost mythical age the greek equivalent was the kronia , which was celebrated on the twelfth day of the month of hekatombaion , which occurred from around mid-july to mid-august on the attic calendar he also mentions that the custom of masters dining with their slaves was associated with the athenian festival of anthesteria and the spartan festival of hyacinthia the argive festival of hybristica , though not directly related to the saturnalia , involved a similar reversal of roles in which women would dress as men and men would dress as women the ancient roman historian justinus credits saturn with being a historical king of the aborigines ( mythology ) : saturnalia was characterized by role reversals and behavioral license ancient sources differ on the circumstances : some suggest that master and slave dined together , seneca , epistulae 47.14 ; carlin a horace , satires 2.7.4 , libertas decembri ; in two satires set during the saturnalia , horace has a slave offer sharp criticism to his master horace , satires , book 2 , poems 3 and 7 ; catherine keane , figuring genre in roman satire ( oxford university press , 2006 ) , p everyone knew , however , that the leveling of the social hierarchy was temporary and had limits ;

bastnäsite has cerium , lanthanum and yttrium in its generalized formula but officially the mineral is divided into three minerals based on the predominant rare-earth element there is bastnäsite- ( ce ) with a more accurate formula of ( ce , la ) co 3 f there is also bastnäsite- ( la ) with a formula of ( la , ce ) co 3 f and finally there is bastnäsite- ( y ) with a formula of ( y , ce ) co 3 f there is little difference in the three in terms of physical properties and most bastnäsite is bastnäsite- ( ce ) cerium in most natural bastnäsites usually dominates the others bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium , an important industrial metal bastnäsite is closely related to the mineral series parisite the two are both rare-earth fluorocarbonates , but parisite 's formula of ca ( ce , la , nd ) 2 ( co 3 ) 3 f 2 contains calcium ( and a small amount of neodymium ) and a different ratio of constituent ions parisite could be viewed as a formula unit of calcite ( caco 3 ) added to two formula units of bastnäsite bastnäsite forms a series with the minerals hydroxylbastnäsite- ( ce ) ( ce , la ) co 3 ( oh , f ) and hydroxylbastnäsite- ( nd ) bastnäsite gets its name from its type locality , the bastnäs mine , riddarhyttan , västmanland , sweden although a scarce mineral and never in great concentrations , it is one of the more common rare-earth carbonates

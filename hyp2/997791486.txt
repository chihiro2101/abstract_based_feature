bastnäsite has cerium , lanthanum and yttrium in its generalized formula but officially the mineral is divided into three minerals based on the predominant rare-earth element there is bastnäsite- ( ce ) with a more accurate formula of ( ce , la ) co 3 f there is also bastnäsite- ( la ) with a formula of ( la , ce ) co 3 f and finally there is bastnäsite- ( y ) with a formula of ( y , ce ) co 3 f there is little difference in the three in terms of physical properties and most bastnäsite is bastnäsite- ( ce ) bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium , an important industrial metal bastnäsite is closely related to the mineral series parisite bastnäsite forms a series with the minerals hydroxylbastnäsite- ( ce ) ( ce , la ) co 3 ( oh , f ) and hydroxylbastnäsite- ( nd ) bastnäsite gets its name from its type locality , the bastnäs mine , riddarhyttan , västmanland , sweden among these are the chemical elements cerium , which was described by hisinger in 1803 , and lanthanum in 1839 hisinger , who was also the owner of the bastnäs mine , chose to name one of the new minerals bastnäsit when it was first described by him in 1838 at mountain pass , bastnäsite is the leading ore mineral with increasing temperature , the habit of ndco 3 oh crystals changes progressively to more complex spherulitic or dendritic morphologies

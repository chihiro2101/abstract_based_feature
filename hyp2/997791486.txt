bastnäsite has cerium , lanthanum and yttrium in its generalized formula but officially the mineral is divided into three minerals based on the predominant rare-earth element there is bastnäsite- ( ce ) with a more accurate formula of ( ce , la ) co 3 f there is also bastnäsite- ( la ) with a formula of ( la , ce ) co 3 f and finally there is bastnäsite- ( y ) with a formula of ( y , ce ) co 3 f there is little difference in the three in terms of physical properties and most bastnäsite is bastnäsite- ( ce ) ( 2004 ) extractive metallurgy of rare earths , crc press parisite could be viewed as a formula unit of calcite ( caco 3 ) added to two formula units of bastnäsite bastnäsite forms a series with the minerals hydroxylbastnäsite- ( ce ) ( ce , la ) co 3 ( oh , f ) and hydroxylbastnäsite- ( nd ) bastnäsite gets its name from its type locality , the bastnäs mine , riddarhyttan , västmanland , sweden at mountain pass , bastnäsite is the leading ore mineral the formation of hydroxylbastnasite ( ndco 3 oh ) can also occur via the crystallization of a rare-earth bearing amorphous precursor , 220 & nbsp ; °c ) and after rapid heating ( e.g solvent from la , nd , and pr separation is recycled to step 11

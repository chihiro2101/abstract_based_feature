tailless aircraft have been experimented with since the earliest attempts to fly dunne was an early pioneer , his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910 hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role however , it still required a short fuselage to house the crew and additional passengers the soviet boris ivanovich cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s other 1930s examples of true flying wings include frenchman charles fauvel 's av3 glider of 1933 and the american freel flying wing glider flown in 1937 in nazi germany , the horten brothers were keen proponents of the flying wing configuration , developing their own designs around it one such aircraft they produced was the horten h.iv glider , which was produced in low numbers between 1941 and 1943 '' the flying wing decades ahead of its time several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines the most famous example of these designs would be the horten ho 229 fighter-bomber , which first flew in 1944 during december 1942 , northrop flew the n-9m , a one-third scale development aircraft for a proposed long-range bomber ; several were produced , all but one were scrapped following the bomber programme 's termination in britain , the baynes bat glider was flown during wartime ; it was a one-third scale experimental aircraft intended to test out the configuration for potential winged tank the second a.w.52 remained flying with the royal aircraft establishment until 1954 the work on the northrop n-1m led to the yb-35 long-range bomber , with pre-production machines flying in 1946 due to the practical need for a deep wing , the flying wing concept is most practical for subsonic aircraft a clean flying wing is sometimes presented as theoretically the most aerodynamics efficient ( lowest drag ) design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin , and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters , pods , nacelles , fins , and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft due to the necessity for elevons to be located near the wingtips , the one on the upward-moving wing causes drag that impedes turning as it deflects the high-pressure airflow under the wing ; control of a swept wing tailless aircraft through wing morphing , icas 2008 : 26th congress of international council of the aeronautical sciences , paper icas 2008-2.7.1 , pages 1â€“2 although sometimes referred to as flying wings , these types carry the pilot ( and engine where fitted ) below the wing structure rather than inside it , and so are not true flying wings list of flying wings delta wing lifting body oblique wing vincent burnelli zanonia macrocarpa 2 glen edwards and the flying wing flying wings are coming , march 1942

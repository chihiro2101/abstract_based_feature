tailless aircraft have been experimented with since the earliest attempts to fly dunne was an early pioneer , his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910 hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role the soviet boris ivanovich cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b men like chizhevskij and antonov also came into the spotlight of the communist party by designing aircraft like the tailless bok-5 bok-5 , v.a.chizhevskij ( chizhevskij ) and oka-33 '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b ( the first ever built by antonov ) which were designated as '' motorized gliders '' due to their similarity to popular gliders of the time in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s other 1930s examples of true flying wings include frenchman charles fauvel 's av3 glider of 1933 and the american freel flying wing glider flown in 1937 in nazi germany , the horten brothers were keen proponents of the flying wing configuration , developing their own designs around it several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines during december 1942 , northrop flew the n-9m , a one-third scale development aircraft for a proposed long-range bomber ; several were produced , all but one were scrapped following the bomber programme 's termination the second a.w.52 remained flying with the royal aircraft establishment until 1954 in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b ( retrieved 15 may 2014 ) multiple british manufacturers also explored the concept at this time following the arrival of supersonic aircraft during the 1950s , military interest in the flying wing was quickly curtailed , as the concept of adopting a thick wing that accommodated the crew and equipment directly conflicted with the optimal thin wing for supersonic flight in this case , the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary reasons for the design 's adoption however , modern computer-controlled fly-by-wire systems allow for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized , making for an efficient and effectively stable long-range bomber due to the practical need for a deep wing , the flying wing concept is most practical for subsonic aircraft typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin , and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters , pods , nacelles , fins , and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft this is the stabilization scheme used in the early northrop flying wings , in combination with vertical engine nacelles ( yb-35 ) or diminutive stabilizers ( yb-49 ) the restoration of outer lift by the elevon creates a slight thrust for the rear ( outer ) section of the wing during the turn the design is claimed to feature low wave drag , high subsonic efficiency and little or no sonic boom although sometimes referred to as flying wings , these types carry the pilot ( and engine where fitted ) below the wing structure rather than inside it , and so are not true flying wings 2 glen edwards and the flying wing flying wings are coming , march 1942

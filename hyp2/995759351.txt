dunne was an early pioneer , his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910 hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s despite attempts to pursuit orders from the aviation ministry , the pterodactyl programme was ultimately cancelled during the mid 1930s before any order for the mk he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role his deep-chord monoplane wing was incorporated in the otherwise conventional junkers j 1 in december 1915 junkers conceived futuristic flying wings for up to 1,000 passengers ; the nearest this came to realization was in the 1931 junkers g.38 34-seater grossflugzeug airliner , which featured a large thick-chord wing providing space for fuel , engines , and two passenger cabins the soviet boris ivanovich cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 after the 1920s , soviet designers such as cheranovsky worked independently and in secret under stalin with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s the northrop n-1m , a scale prototype for a long-range bomber , first flew in 1940 other 1930s examples of true flying wings include frenchman charles fauvel 's av3 glider of 1933 and the american freel flying wing glider flown in 1937 in nazi germany , the horten brothers were keen proponents of the flying wing configuration , developing their own designs around it '' the flying wing decades ahead of its time several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines the british armstrong whitworth a.w.52g of 1944 was a glider test bed for tailless research , the company holding ambitions to develop a large flying wing airliner capable of serving transatlantic routes first flown on 13 november 1947 , the a.w.52 yielded disappointing results ; the first prototype crashed without loss of life on 30 may 1949 , the occasion being the first emergency use of an ejection seat by a british pilot the second a.w.52 remained flying with the royal aircraft establishment until 1954 the work on the northrop n-1m led to the yb-35 long-range bomber , with pre-production machines flying in 1946 in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b several other nations also opted to undertake flying wing projects these compromises are difficult to reconcile , and efforts to do so can reduce or even negate the expected advantages of the flying wing design , such as reductions in weight and drag typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin , and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters , pods , nacelles , fins , and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft ; control of a swept wing tailless aircraft through wing morphing , icas 2008 : 26th congress of international council of the aeronautical sciences , paper icas 2008-2.7.1 , pages 1â€“2 an aircraft of sharply swept delta planform and deep center section represents a borderline case between flying wing , blended wing body , and/or lifting body configurations 2 glen edwards and the flying wing flying wings are coming , march 1942

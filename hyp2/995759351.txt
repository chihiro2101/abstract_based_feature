dunne was an early pioneer , his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910 hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role junkers conceived futuristic flying wings for up to 1,000 passengers ; the nearest this came to realization was in the 1931 junkers g.38 34-seater grossflugzeug airliner , which featured a large thick-chord wing providing space for fuel , engines , and two passenger cabins however , it still required a short fuselage to house the crew and additional passengers the soviet boris ivanovich cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s the eshelman fw-5 , which was commonly referred to as the wing , was an experimental cabin monoplane other 1930s examples of true flying wings include frenchman charles fauvel 's av3 glider of 1933 and the american freel flying wing glider flown in 1937 '' the flying wing decades ahead of its time several other late-war german military designs were based on the flying wing concept , or variations of it , as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines plans were made to produce the type as the gotha go 229 during the closing stages of the conflict despite intentions to develop the go 229 and an improved go p.60 for several roles , including as a night fighter , no gotha-built go 229s or p.60s were ever completed the unflown , nearly completed surviving '' v3 , '' or third prototype was captured by american forces and send back for study ; it has ended up in storage at the smithsonian institution during december 1942 , northrop flew the n-9m , a one-third scale development aircraft for a proposed long-range bomber ; several were produced , all but one were scrapped following the bomber programme 's termination the british armstrong whitworth a.w.52g of 1944 was a glider test bed for tailless research , the company holding ambitions to develop a large flying wing airliner capable of serving transatlantic routes the work on the northrop n-1m led to the yb-35 long-range bomber , with pre-production machines flying in 1946 in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b several other nations also opted to undertake flying wing projects following the arrival of supersonic aircraft during the 1950s , military interest in the flying wing was quickly curtailed , as the concept of adopting a thick wing that accommodated the crew and equipment directly conflicted with the optimal thin wing for supersonic flight a clean flying wing is sometimes presented as theoretically the most aerodynamics efficient ( lowest drag ) design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft the restoration of outer lift by the elevon creates a slight thrust for the rear ( outer ) section of the wing during the turn in some flying wing designs , any stabilizing fins and associated control rudders would be too far forward to have much effect , thus alternative means for yaw control are sometimes provided an aircraft of sharply swept delta planform and deep center section represents a borderline case between flying wing , blended wing body , and/or lifting body configurations 2 glen edwards and the flying wing flying wings are coming , march 1942

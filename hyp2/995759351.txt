tailless aircraft have been experimented with since the earliest attempts to fly dunne was an early pioneer , his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910 hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s despite attempts to pursuit orders from the aviation ministry , the pterodactyl programme was ultimately cancelled during the mid 1930s before any order for the mk he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role his deep-chord monoplane wing was incorporated in the otherwise conventional junkers j 1 in december 1915 however , it still required a short fuselage to house the crew and additional passengers the soviet boris ivanovich cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b competed with the horten brothers h1 and adolf galland at the ninth glider competitions in 1933 , but was not demonstrated in the 1936 summer olympics in berlin in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s other 1930s examples of true flying wings include frenchman charles fauvel 's av3 glider of 1933 and the american freel flying wing glider flown in 1937 one such aircraft they produced was the horten h.iv glider , which was produced in low numbers between 1941 and 1943 '' the flying wing decades ahead of its time the most famous example of these designs would be the horten ho 229 fighter-bomber , which first flew in 1944 the unflown , nearly completed surviving '' v3 , '' or third prototype was captured by american forces and send back for study ; it has ended up in storage at the smithsonian institution the british armstrong whitworth a.w.52g of 1944 was a glider test bed for tailless research , the company holding ambitions to develop a large flying wing airliner capable of serving transatlantic routes the second a.w.52 remained flying with the royal aircraft establishment until 1954 the work on the northrop n-1m led to the yb-35 long-range bomber , with pre-production machines flying in 1946 in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b several other nations also opted to undertake flying wing projects moreover , solutions may produce a final design that is still too unsafe for certain uses , such as commercial aviation such a large fin has weight and drag penalties , and can negate the advantages of the flying wing another solution is to angle or crank the wing tip sections downward with significant anhedral , increasing the area at the rear of the aircraft when viewed from the side this is the stabilization scheme used in the early northrop flying wings , in combination with vertical engine nacelles ( yb-35 ) or diminutive stabilizers ( yb-49 ) although sometimes referred to as flying wings , these types carry the pilot ( and engine where fitted ) below the wing structure rather than inside it , and so are not true flying wings

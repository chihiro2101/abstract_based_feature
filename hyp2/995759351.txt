dunne was an early pioneer , his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910 hill , who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs , collectively known as the westland-hill pterodactyl , during the 1920s and early 1930s germany 's hugo junkers patented his own wing-only air transport concept in 1910 , seeing it as a natural solution to the problem of building an airliner large enough to carry a reasonable passenger load and enough fuel to cross the atlantic in regular service he believed that the flying wing 's potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role in 1919 he started work on his '' giant '' jg1 design , intended to seat passengers within a thick wing , but two years later the allied aeronautical commission of control ordered the incomplete jg1 destroyed for exceeding postwar size limits on german aircraft junkers conceived futuristic flying wings for up to 1,000 passengers ; the nearest this came to realization was in the 1931 junkers g.38 34-seater grossflugzeug airliner , which featured a large thick-chord wing providing space for fuel , engines , and two passenger cabins the soviet boris ivanovich cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924 with significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods , aircraft such as the bich-3 , '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b men like chizhevskij and antonov also came into the spotlight of the communist party by designing aircraft like the tailless bok-5 bok-5 , v.a.chizhevskij ( chizhevskij ) and oka-33 '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b in germany , alexander lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings , while the horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s other 1930s examples of true flying wings include frenchman charles fauvel 's av3 glider of 1933 and the american freel flying wing glider flown in 1937 in nazi germany , the horten brothers were keen proponents of the flying wing configuration , developing their own designs around it one such aircraft they produced was the horten h.iv glider , which was produced in low numbers between 1941 and 1943 despite intentions to develop the go 229 and an improved go p.60 for several roles , including as a night fighter , no gotha-built go 229s or p.60s were ever completed first flown on 13 november 1947 , the a.w.52 yielded disappointing results ; the first prototype crashed without loss of life on 30 may 1949 , the occasion being the first emergency use of an ejection seat by a british pilot in the soviet union , the bich-26 , became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948 ; '' history of aircraft construction in the ussr '' by v.b this approach eventually led to the northrop grumman b-2 spirit , a flying wing stealth bomber due to the practical need for a deep wing , the flying wing concept is most practical for subsonic aircraft the problem becomes more acute at supersonic speeds , where the drag of a thick wing rises sharply and it is essential for the wing to be made thin the hortens described a '' bell shaped lift distribution '' across the span of the wing , with more lift in the center section and less at the tips due to their reduced angle of incidence , or washing out ; control of a swept wing tailless aircraft through wing morphing , icas 2008 : 26th congress of international council of the aeronautical sciences , paper icas 2008-2.7.1 , pages 1â€“2 one solution to the control problem is differential drag : the drag near one wing tip is artificially increased , causing the aircraft to yaw in the direction of that wing the supersonic bi-directional flying wing design comprises a long-span low speed wing and a short-span high speed wing joined in the form of an unequal cross zha , im & espinal , toward zero sonic-boom and high efficiency supersonic flight : a novel concept of supersonic bi-directional flying wing nasa has funded a study of the proposal although sometimes referred to as flying wings , these types carry the pilot ( and engine where fitted ) below the wing structure rather than inside it , and so are not true flying wings list of flying wings delta wing lifting body oblique wing vincent burnelli zanonia macrocarpa

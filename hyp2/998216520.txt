the term tracker derives from ultimate soundtracker ( the first tracker software ) written by karsten obarski and released in 1987 by eas computer technik for the commodore amiga the general concept of step-sequencing samples numerically , as used in trackers , is also found in the fairlight cmi sampling workstation of the early 1980s some early tracker-like programs appeared for the msx ( yamaha cx5m ) and commodore 64 , before 1987 , such as sound monitor , but these did not feature sample playback , instead playing notes on the computer 's internal synthesizer later , programs like rock monitor also supported additional sample playback , usually with short drum samples loaded in ram memory the first trackers supported four pitch and volume modulated channels of 8-bit pcm samples , a limitation derived from the amiga 's paula audio chipset and the commonplace 8svx format used to store sampled sound another sound card popular on the pc tracker scene was the gravis ultrasound , which continued the hardware mixing tradition , with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage inevitably , the balance was largely redressed with the introduction of the sound blaster awe32 and its successors , which also featured on-board ram and wavetable ( or sample table ) mixing from the typical 4 mod channels of the amiga , the limit had moved to 7 with tfmx players and 8 , first with oktalyzer and later with the vastly more popular octamed ( all amiga programs ) , then 32 with screamtracker 3 and fasttracker 2 on the pc and on to 64 with impulse tracker ( pc ) and med soundstudio ( amiga and later pc ) all sound tracker was able to combine both the fm synthesis of the opl chips and the sample based synthesis of the emu-8000 chips in the sound blaster awe series of cards as well as midi output to any additional hardware of choice each machine would have its own tracker , drum machines would use a tracker-like drum pattern editor and effect and control machines could be automated tracker-like via tables of parameters whereas the original amiga trackers only provided four tracks , the hardware limit , modern trackers can mix a virtually unlimited number of channels into one sound stream through software mixing many of these programs are designed for creating music for a particular synthesizer chip such as the opl chips of the adlib and soundblaster sound cards , or the sound chips of classic home computers

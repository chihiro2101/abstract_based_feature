the term tracker derives from ultimate soundtracker ( the first tracker software ) written by karsten obarski and released in 1987 by eas computer technik for the commodore amiga some early tracker-like programs appeared for the msx ( yamaha cx5m ) and commodore 64 , before 1987 , such as sound monitor , but these did not feature sample playback , instead playing notes on the computer 's internal synthesizer later , programs like rock monitor also supported additional sample playback , usually with short drum samples loaded in ram memory during the 1990s , tracker musicians gravitated to the pc as software production in general switched from the amiga platform to the pc another sound card popular on the pc tracker scene was the gravis ultrasound , which continued the hardware mixing tradition , with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage the responsibility for audio mixing passed from hardware to software ( the main cpu ) which gradually enabled the use of more channels from the typical 4 mod channels of the amiga , the limit had moved to 7 with tfmx players and 8 , first with oktalyzer and later with the vastly more popular octamed ( all amiga programs ) , then 32 with screamtracker 3 and fasttracker 2 on the pc and on to 64 with impulse tracker ( pc ) and med soundstudio ( amiga and later pc ) an amiga tracker called symphonie pro even supported 256 channels all sound tracker was able to combine both the fm synthesis of the opl chips and the sample based synthesis of the emu-8000 chips in the sound blaster awe series of cards as well as midi output to any additional hardware of choice many of these programs are designed for creating music for a particular synthesizer chip such as the opl chips of the adlib and soundblaster sound cards , or the sound chips of classic home computers tracker music is typically stored in module files where the song data and samples are encapsulated in a single file this also makes the self-teaching of music composition using trackers easier and allows to extract instruments for later use in own songs , which was very common .

the term tracker derives from ultimate soundtracker ( the first tracker software ) written by karsten obarski and released in 1987 by eas computer technik for the commodore amiga the general concept of step-sequencing samples numerically , as used in trackers , is also found in the fairlight cmi sampling workstation of the early 1980s later , programs like rock monitor also supported additional sample playback , usually with short drum samples loaded in ram memory however , since the notes were samples , the limitation was less important than those of synthesizing music chips another sound card popular on the pc tracker scene was the gravis ultrasound , which continued the hardware mixing tradition , with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage from the typical 4 mod channels of the amiga , the limit had moved to 7 with tfmx players and 8 , first with oktalyzer and later with the vastly more popular octamed ( all amiga programs ) , then 32 with screamtracker 3 and fasttracker 2 on the pc and on to 64 with impulse tracker ( pc ) and med soundstudio ( amiga and later pc ) all sound tracker was able to combine both the fm synthesis of the opl chips and the sample based synthesis of the emu-8000 chips in the sound blaster awe series of cards as well as midi output to any additional hardware of choice there are several elements common to any tracker program : samples , notes , effects , tracks ( or channels ) , patterns , and orders whereas the original amiga trackers only provided four tracks , the hardware limit , modern trackers can mix a virtually unlimited number of channels into one sound stream through software mixing many of these programs are designed for creating music for a particular synthesizer chip such as the opl chips of the adlib and soundblaster sound cards , or the sound chips of classic home computers tracker music is typically stored in module files where the song data and samples are encapsulated in a single file this also makes the self-teaching of music composition using trackers easier and allows to extract instruments for later use in own songs , which was very common .

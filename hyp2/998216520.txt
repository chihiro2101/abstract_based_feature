the term tracker derives from ultimate soundtracker ( the first tracker software ) written by karsten obarski and released in 1987 by eas computer technik for the commodore amiga some early tracker-like programs appeared for the msx ( yamaha cx5m ) and commodore 64 , before 1987 , such as sound monitor , but these did not feature sample playback , instead playing notes on the computer 's internal synthesizer later , programs like rock monitor also supported additional sample playback , usually with short drum samples loaded in ram memory the first trackers supported four pitch and volume modulated channels of 8-bit pcm samples , a limitation derived from the amiga 's paula audio chipset and the commonplace 8svx format used to store sampled sound during the 1990s , tracker musicians gravitated to the pc as software production in general switched from the amiga platform to the pc another sound card popular on the pc tracker scene was the gravis ultrasound , which continued the hardware mixing tradition , with 32 internal channels and onboard memory for sample storage from the typical 4 mod channels of the amiga , the limit had moved to 7 with tfmx players and 8 , first with oktalyzer and later with the vastly more popular octamed ( all amiga programs ) , then 32 with screamtracker 3 and fasttracker 2 on the pc and on to 64 with impulse tracker ( pc ) and med soundstudio ( amiga and later pc ) all sound tracker was able to combine both the fm synthesis of the opl chips and the sample based synthesis of the emu-8000 chips in the sound blaster awe series of cards as well as midi output to any additional hardware of choice tracker music could be found in computer games of the late 1990s and early 2000s , such as the unreal series , deus ex , crusader : no remorse , jazz jackrabbit and uplink there are several elements common to any tracker program : samples , notes , effects , tracks ( or channels ) , patterns , and orders whereas the original amiga trackers only provided four tracks , the hardware limit , modern trackers can mix a virtually unlimited number of channels into one sound stream through software mixing tracker music is typically stored in module files where the song data and samples are encapsulated in a single file

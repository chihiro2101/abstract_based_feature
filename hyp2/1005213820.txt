differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods during heat treating , when red-hot steel ( usually between and is quenched , it becomes very hard quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness however , although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking , it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling , peening , or curling 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle to achieve this , the edge is cooled faster than the spine by adding a heat insulator to the spine before quenching to prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon , quenching is usually performed before beveling , shaping , and sharpening the edge it can also be achieved by carefully pouring water ( perhaps already heated ) onto the edge of a blade as is the case with the manufacture of some kukri differential tempering was more commonly used to make cutting tools , although it was sometimes used on knives and swords as well differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades the heated portion of the metal is softened by this process , leaving the edge at the higher hardness this helps to create a tough blade that will maintain a very sharp , wear-resistant edge , even during rough use such as found in combat a differentially hardened blade will usually be coated with an insulating layer , like clay , but leaving the edge exposed 49 the clay is often applied by painting it on , coating the blade very thickly around the center and spine , but leaving the edge exposed this allows the edge to cool very quickly , turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite , but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly , turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite the edge , however , will usually be too hard , so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time , to bring the hardness of the edge down to around hrc60 on the rockwell hardness scale by controlling the thickness of the edge-coating along with the temperature of the water , the cooling rate of each part of the blade can be controlled to produce the proper hardness upon quenching without the need for further tempering once the coating has dried , the blade is heated slowly and evenly , to prevent the coating from cracking or falling off after the blade is heated to the proper temperature , which is usually judged by the cherry-red glow ( blackbody radiation ) of the blade , it will change into a phase called austenite to prevent this , the blade is usually kept in motion while heating , to distribute the heat more evenly the clay , in turn , insulates the back of the blade , causing it to cool slower than the edge because the rest of the blade cools slowly , the carbon in the austenite has time to precipitate , becoming pearlite this typically causes the blade to bend or curve during quenching , as the back contracts more than the edge this gives swords like katana and wakizashi their characteristic curved shapes care must be taken to plunge the sword quickly and vertically ( edge first ) , for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways ( warp ) because quenching in water tends to cause a sudden loss of surface carbon , the sword will usually be quenched before the edge is beveled and sharpened after quenching and tempering , the blade was traditionally given a rough shape with a draw knife before sending to a polisher for sharpening , smith , pp the back and center of the blade will grind away much quicker than the edge , so the polisher will need to carefully control the angle of the edge , which will affect the geometry of the blade the hardened portion of the blade ( yakiba ) and the center portion ( hira ) are often given a matte finish instead , to make the differences in the hardness stand out 47 however , unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially quenched , flame hardening creates a heat-affected zone 101 before the yellow or '' light-straw '' color reaches the edge , the smith removes the heat unlike with differential hardening , in differential tempering there is no distinct boundary between the harder and softer metals , but the change from hard to soft is very gradual , forming a continuum , or '' grade '' ( gradient ) , of hardness when a sword , knife or tool is evenly quenched , the entire object turns into martensite , which is extremely hard , without the formation of soft pearlite without the formation of pearlite , the steel can be incrementally tempered to achieve the proper hardness in each area , ensuring that no area is too soft a sword tempered this way can not usually have an edge as hard as a differentially-hardened sword , like a katana , because there is no softer metal directly underneath the edge to back-up the harder metal the sword will often be tempered to slightly higher temperatures to increase the impact resistance at a cost in the ability to hold a sharp edge when cutting

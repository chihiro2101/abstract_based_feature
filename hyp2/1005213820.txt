differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others differential heat treatment can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated , or '' through treated '' there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods during heat treating , when red-hot steel ( usually between and is quenched , it becomes very hard quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle this technique is mainly used in later chinese jian , chinese dao , and the katana , the traditional japanese sword , and the khukuri , the traditional nepalese knife warring states to han dynasty ) used tempering rather than differential heat treatment modern versions of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised , such as an oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating with flame hardening and induction hardening techniques , the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched differential tempering was more commonly used to make cutting tools , although it was sometimes used on knives and swords as well differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades the heated portion of the metal is softened by this process , leaving the edge at the higher hardness differential hardening ( also called differential quenching , selective quenching , selective hardening , or local hardening ) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge this helps to make the blade very resistant to breaking , by making the spine very soft and bendable , but allows greater hardness at the edge than would be possible if the blade was uniformly quenched and tempered a differentially hardened blade will usually be coated with an insulating layer , like clay , but leaving the edge exposed the insulation layer is quite often a mixture of clays , ashes , polishing stone powder , and salts , which protects the back of the blade from cooling very quickly when quenched this produces an edge that is exceptionally hard and brittle , but is backed-up by softer , tougher metal the edge , however , will usually be too hard , so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time , to bring the hardness of the edge down to around hrc60 on the rockwell hardness scale the exact composition of the clay mixture , the thickness of the coating , and even the temperature of the water were often closely guarded secrets of the various bladesmithing schools sometimes the back of the blade was coated with clay , leaving the edge exposed by controlling the thickness of the edge-coating along with the temperature of the water , the cooling rate of each part of the blade can be controlled to produce the proper hardness upon quenching without the need for further tempering to prevent this , the blade is usually kept in motion while heating , to distribute the heat more evenly typically , the smith will also try to avoid overheating the blade to prevent the metallic crystals from growing too large when the edge cools fast a diffusionless transformation occurs , turning the austenite into very hard martensite the blade is usually straight when heated but then bows as it cools ; first curving toward the edge as it contracts , and then away from the edge as the spine contracts more because quenching in water tends to cause a sudden loss of surface carbon , the sword will usually be quenched before the edge is beveled and sharpened differential hardening will produce two different zones of hardness , which respond differently to grinding , sharpening , and polishing the back and center of the blade will grind away much quicker than the edge , so the polisher will need to carefully control the angle of the edge , which will affect the geometry of the blade when polished or etched with acid to reveal these features , a distinct boundary is observed between the martensite portion of the blade and the pearlite this boundary is often called the '' temper line '' , or the commonly used japanese term , the '' hamon '' swords of this type can usually only be resharpened a few times before reaching the softer metal underneath the edge when edge turns the proper color temperature , it is quenched , hardening only the edge , but leaving most of the rest of the blade at the lower hardness unlike with differential hardening , in differential tempering there is no distinct boundary between the harder and softer metals , but the change from hard to soft is very gradual , forming a continuum , or '' grade '' ( gradient ) , of hardness to prevent too much heat loss in the blade , it may be preheated , partially insulated , or sandwiched between two red-hot bars when a sword , knife or tool is evenly quenched , the entire object turns into martensite , which is extremely hard , without the formation of soft pearlite this may leave very little difference between the edge and the center , and the benefits of this method , over tempering the sword evenly at a point somewhere in the middle , may not be very substantial

differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others differential heat treatment can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated , or '' through treated '' there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods during heat treating , when red-hot steel ( usually between and is quenched , it becomes very hard however , although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking , it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling , peening , or curling 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle to achieve this , the edge is cooled faster than the spine by adding a heat insulator to the spine before quenching warring states to han dynasty ) used tempering rather than differential heat treatment with flame hardening and induction hardening techniques , the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched this hardens only part of the object , but leaves the rest unaltered differential tempering was more commonly used to make cutting tools , although it was sometimes used on knives and swords as well differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades differential hardening ( also called differential quenching , selective quenching , selective hardening , or local hardening ) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge when it is heated to red-hot and quenched , the edge cools quickly , becoming very hard , but the rest cools slowly , becoming much softer 49 the clay is often applied by painting it on , coating the blade very thickly around the center and spine , but leaving the edge exposed this allows the edge to cool very quickly , turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite , but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly , turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite the edge , however , will usually be too hard , so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time , to bring the hardness of the edge down to around hrc60 on the rockwell hardness scale other times the entire blade was coated and then the clay was cut away from the edge another method was to apply the clay thickly at the back but thinly at the edge , providing a lesser amount of insulation after the blade is heated to the proper temperature , which is usually judged by the cherry-red glow ( blackbody radiation ) of the blade , it will change into a phase called austenite at this time the blade will usually be plunged into a vat of water or oil , to quickly remove the heat from the edge the clay , in turn , insulates the back of the blade , causing it to cool slower than the edge this requires a temperature drop from around 750 °c ( cherry-red ) to 450 °c ( at which point the transformation is complete ) in less than a second to prevent the formation of soft pearlite because the rest of the blade cools slowly , the carbon in the austenite has time to precipitate , becoming pearlite the diffusionless transformation causes the edge to '' freeze '' suddenly in a thermal expansion state , but allows the back to contract as it cools slower the blade is usually straight when heated but then bows as it cools ; first curving toward the edge as it contracts , and then away from the edge as the spine contracts more the sword may need further shaping after quenching and tempering , to achieve the desired curvature care must be taken to plunge the sword quickly and vertically ( edge first ) , for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways ( warp ) because quenching in water tends to cause a sudden loss of surface carbon , the sword will usually be quenched before the edge is beveled and sharpened 49–52 although in modern times an electric belt sander is often used instead the back and center of the blade will grind away much quicker than the edge , so the polisher will need to carefully control the angle of the edge , which will affect the geometry of the blade an inexperienced polisher can quickly ruin a blade by applying too much pressure to the softened areas , rapidly altering the blade 's shape without much change to the hardened zone with induction heating , the steel can be heated very quickly to red-hot at the surface , before the heat can penetrate any distance into the metal however , with double-edged blades , the heat source will usually need to be more precisely localized because the heat must be applied evenly along the center of the blade , allowing it to conduct to both edges when a sword , knife or tool is evenly quenched , the entire object turns into martensite , which is extremely hard , without the formation of soft pearlite a sword tempered this way can not usually have an edge as hard as a differentially-hardened sword , like a katana , because there is no softer metal directly underneath the edge to back-up the harder metal claying blades – differential hardening with clay

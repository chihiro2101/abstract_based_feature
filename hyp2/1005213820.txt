differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others this creates greater toughness in the parts of the object where it is needed , such as the tang or spine of a sword , but produces greater hardness at the edge or other areas where greater impact resistance , wear resistance , and strength is needed differential heat treatment can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated , or '' through treated '' there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods during heat treating , when red-hot steel ( usually between and is quenched , it becomes very hard quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness however , although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking , it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling , peening , or curling knife talk ii : the high performance blade by ed fowler – krause publications 2003 p 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle warring states to han dynasty ) used tempering rather than differential heat treatment this method is sometimes called differential tempering , but this term more accurately refers to a different technique , which originated with the broadswords of europe with flame hardening and induction hardening techniques , the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched this hardens only part of the object , but leaves the rest unaltered differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades this is usually done with a torch or some other directed heat source the heated portion of the metal is softened by this process , leaving the edge at the higher hardness differential hardening ( also called differential quenching , selective quenching , selective hardening , or local hardening ) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge a differentially hardened blade will usually be coated with an insulating layer , like clay , but leaving the edge exposed when it is heated to red-hot and quenched , the edge cools quickly , becoming very hard , but the rest cools slowly , becoming much softer this allows the edge to cool very quickly , turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite , but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly , turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite sometimes the back of the blade was coated with clay , leaving the edge exposed both to help prevent cracking and to produce uniformity in the hardness of each area , the smith will need to ensure that the temperature is even , lacking any hot spots from sitting next to the coals at this time the blade will usually be plunged into a vat of water or oil , to quickly remove the heat from the edge when the edge cools fast a diffusionless transformation occurs , turning the austenite into very hard martensite the diffusionless transformation causes the edge to '' freeze '' suddenly in a thermal expansion state , but allows the back to contract as it cools slower this typically causes the blade to bend or curve during quenching , as the back contracts more than the edge up to one third of all swords are often ruined during the quenching process after quenching and tempering , the blade was traditionally given a rough shape with a draw knife before sending to a polisher for sharpening , smith , pp an inexperienced polisher can quickly ruin a blade by applying too much pressure to the softened areas , rapidly altering the blade 's shape without much change to the hardened zone smith although both the pearlite and martensite can be polished to a mirror-like shine , only the back and spine are usually polished to such an extent flame hardening is often used to harden only a portion of an object , by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a localized area , and then quenching the steel 394–400 this process is often used for knife making , by heating only the edge of a previously quenched and tempered blade the blade is then heated in a localized area , allowing the heat to flow toward the edge the blade is heated along the spine and tang only , allowing the heat to conduct to the edge differential tempering can be made more difficult by the shape of the blade when a sword , knife or tool is evenly quenched , the entire object turns into martensite , which is extremely hard , without the formation of soft pearlite without the formation of pearlite , the steel can be incrementally tempered to achieve the proper hardness in each area , ensuring that no area is too soft

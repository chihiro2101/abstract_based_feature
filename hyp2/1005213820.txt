differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others differential heat treatment can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated , or '' through treated '' there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods during heat treating , when red-hot steel ( usually between and is quenched , it becomes very hard quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness however , although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking , it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling , peening , or curling 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle to achieve this , the edge is cooled faster than the spine by adding a heat insulator to the spine before quenching to prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon , quenching is usually performed before beveling , shaping , and sharpening the edge warring states to han dynasty ) used tempering rather than differential heat treatment modern versions of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised , such as an oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating with flame hardening and induction hardening techniques , the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched differential tempering was more commonly used to make cutting tools , although it was sometimes used on knives and swords as well differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades the heated portion of the metal is softened by this process , leaving the edge at the higher hardness differential hardening ( also called differential quenching , selective quenching , selective hardening , or local hardening ) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge this helps to make the blade very resistant to breaking , by making the spine very soft and bendable , but allows greater hardness at the edge than would be possible if the blade was uniformly quenched and tempered a differentially hardened blade will usually be coated with an insulating layer , like clay , but leaving the edge exposed when it is heated to red-hot and quenched , the edge cools quickly , becoming very hard , but the rest cools slowly , becoming much softer 114–115 nova secrets of the samurai sword 49 the clay is often applied by painting it on , coating the blade very thickly around the center and spine , but leaving the edge exposed the edge , however , will usually be too hard , so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time , to bring the hardness of the edge down to around hrc60 on the rockwell hardness scale by controlling the thickness of the edge-coating along with the temperature of the water , the cooling rate of each part of the blade can be controlled to produce the proper hardness upon quenching without the need for further tempering the clay , in turn , insulates the back of the blade , causing it to cool slower than the edge this requires a temperature drop from around 750 °c ( cherry-red ) to 450 °c ( at which point the transformation is complete ) in less than a second to prevent the formation of soft pearlite the diffusionless transformation causes the edge to '' freeze '' suddenly in a thermal expansion state , but allows the back to contract as it cools slower this typically causes the blade to bend or curve during quenching , as the back contracts more than the edge after quenching and tempering , the blade was traditionally given a rough shape with a draw knife before sending to a polisher for sharpening , smith , pp the back and center of the blade will grind away much quicker than the edge , so the polisher will need to carefully control the angle of the edge , which will affect the geometry of the blade an inexperienced polisher can quickly ruin a blade by applying too much pressure to the softened areas , rapidly altering the blade 's shape without much change to the hardened zone the gear will usually be quenched and tempered to a specific hardness first , making a majority of the gear tough , and then the teeth are quickly heated and immediately quenched , hardening only the surface the complete modern blacksmith by alexander weygers – ten speed press 1997 before a tool is differentially tempered , it is first heated to red-hot and then quenched , hardening the entire tool instead , the heat is applied to only a part of the tool , allowing the heat to thermally conduct toward the cooler cutting edge however , with double-edged blades , the heat source will usually need to be more precisely localized because the heat must be applied evenly along the center of the blade , allowing it to conduct to both edges when tempering a double-edged sword with a taper along its length , the tip may reach the proper temperature before the shank does in this way , although it is less time-consuming than differential hardening with clay , once the process starts the smith must be vigilant , carefully guiding the heat a sword tempered this way can not usually have an edge as hard as a differentially-hardened sword , like a katana , because there is no softer metal directly underneath the edge to back-up the harder metal

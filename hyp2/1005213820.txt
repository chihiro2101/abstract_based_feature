differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently , producing areas that are harder or softer than others this creates greater toughness in the parts of the object where it is needed , such as the tang or spine of a sword , but produces greater hardness at the edge or other areas where greater impact resistance , wear resistance , and strength is needed differential heat treatment can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated , or '' through treated '' there are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel , but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods during heat treating , when red-hot steel ( usually between and is quenched , it becomes very hard quenched-steel is usually heated again , slowly and evenly ( usually between and in a process called tempering , to soften the metal , thereby increasing the toughness however , although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking , it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling , peening , or curling 115 differential hardening is a method used in heat treating swords and knife to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle differential hardening technology originated in china and later spread to korea and japan this technique is mainly used in later chinese jian , chinese dao , and the katana , the traditional japanese sword , and the khukuri , the traditional nepalese knife warring states to han dynasty ) used tempering rather than differential heat treatment this method is sometimes called differential tempering , but this term more accurately refers to a different technique , which originated with the broadswords of europe modern versions of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised , such as an oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating with flame hardening and induction hardening techniques , the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched this hardens only part of the object , but leaves the rest unaltered differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly , then tempering one part of it , such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades when it is heated to red-hot and quenched , the edge cools quickly , becoming very hard , but the rest cools slowly , becoming much softer with the clay mixture , the main goal was to find a mixture that would withstand high temperatures and adhere to the blade without shrinking , cracking , or peeling as it dried after the blade is heated to the proper temperature , which is usually judged by the cherry-red glow ( blackbody radiation ) of the blade , it will change into a phase called austenite to prevent this , the blade is usually kept in motion while heating , to distribute the heat more evenly typically , the smith will also try to avoid overheating the blade to prevent the metallic crystals from growing too large at this time the blade will usually be plunged into a vat of water or oil , to quickly remove the heat from the edge when the edge cools fast a diffusionless transformation occurs , turning the austenite into very hard martensite with slashing-type swords , this curvature helps to facilitate cutting , but increases the chances of cracking during the procedure however , when the sword does not crack , the internal stresses created help increase the toughness of the blade , similar to the increased toughness in tempered glass the sword may need further shaping after quenching and tempering , to achieve the desired curvature 49–52 although in modern times an electric belt sander is often used instead the pearlite takes on longer , deeper scratches , and either appears shiny and bright , or sometimes dark depending on the viewing angle the martensite usually appears brighter yet flatter than the pearlite , and this is less dependent on the viewing angle the nioi is about a millimeter or two wide , following the hamon , which is made up of individual martensite grains ( niye ) surrounded by pearlite although differential hardening produces a very hard edge , it also leaves the rest of the sword rather soft , which can make it prone to bending under heavy loads , such as parrying a hard blow 394–400 this process is often used for knife making , by heating only the edge of a previously quenched and tempered blade a common use for induction hardening is for hardening the bearing surfaces , or '' journals '' , on automotive crankshafts or the rods of hydraulic cylinders the heat will continue to conduct , moving the colors toward the edge for a short time after the heat is removed sometimes the steel is heated evenly to just below the desired temperature , and then differentially tempered , making it easier to control the temperature change to prevent too much heat loss in the blade , it may be preheated , partially insulated , or sandwiched between two red-hot bars claying blades – differential hardening with clay

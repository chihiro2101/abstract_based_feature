fermentation—allowing beneficial or benign organisms to grow in food to prevent destructive or toxic ones from growing , with respect to meat , has been around for thousands of years also , environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used , as seen in the mediterranean and southern europe , where '' meat products are dried to lower water activity ( aw ) values , taking advantage of the long dry and sunny days , while in northern europe , fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation '' in europe , the main countries that produce salami are france , germany , hungary , italy , and spain , which make several hundred million kilograms per year similar types of sausages are found in the middle east , where various meats such as beef , lamb , and mutton are used ; or in china , where lap cheong ( translated as '' waxed intestines '' ) are usually pork hungarian salami is '' intensively smoked , and then its surface is inoculated with mold starters or spontaneous mold growth a traditional salami , with its typical marbled appearance , is made from beef or pork ( sometimes specifically veal ) beef is usual in halal and kosher salami , which never include pork for religious reasons in the provence region of france , donkey meat is used for salami , as well , the product being sold in street markets higher temperatures ( about 60 & nbsp ; °c ( 140 & nbsp ; °f ) ) stop the fermentation when the salami reaches the desired ph , but the product is not fully cooked ( 75 & nbsp ; °c ( 167 & nbsp ; °f ) or higher ) minor differences in the formulation of the meat or production techniques give rise to the various kinds of salami across different countries before fermentation , raw meat ( usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced ) is ground ( usually coarsely ) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt , sugar , spices , pepper and yeast , and , if the particular salami variety requires it , lactic acid bacterial starter culture for a more modern controlled fermentation , makers hang the salami in warm , humid conditions for 1–3 days to encourage the fermenting bacteria to grow , then hang it in a cool , humid environment to slowly dry in a traditional process , the maker skips the fermentation step and immediately hangs the salami in a cool , humid curing environment the bacteria produce lactic acid as a waste product , which lowers the ph and coagulates the proteins , reducing the meat 's water-holding capacity the bacteria-produced acid makes the meat an inhospitable environment for pathogenic bacteria and imparts a tangy flavor that distinguishes salami from machine-dried pork according to the particular variety of salami , different fermentation methods involving different acids have been explored to create various colours and flavors lactic acid bacteria develop the tangy flavor of salami through the fermentation of carbohydrates and produces an appealing red color to the meat after fermentation , while coagulase-negative cocci can catabolize amino acids and fatty acids to produce volatile compounds other popular dry salamis in italy are mainly made from a combination of pork and small bits of beef , seasoned with garlic ; pepperoni is also made of pork and beef , and is usually smoked ; and chorizo is highly spiced and smoked salami has been found to be a possible allergen to some people due to the use of penicillium species mold starter during the drying and curing portion of processing to add flavor and stop growth of undesirable molds however , it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork back fat in salami with extra virgin olive oil , thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami olive oil contains far more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids , so this substitution purportedly creates a healthier product salami where extra virgin olive oil was substituted for the pork back fat has been shown to have a lower ph of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55 , making the salami more acidic as natural preservatives are becoming more desirable food additives than artificial preservatives in food industries , some studies about salami have been focusing on the use of essential oils such as oregano and clove oil as preservatives that can be applied to salami production due to their anti-fungal activities file : salame italiano.jpg ferrara pressed salami file : finocchiona from tuscany.jpg finocchiona , tuscan salami sausage with fennel file : skilandis2.jpg skilandis , a lithuanian sausage file : salame di felino.jpg felino salami file : dominican salami.jpg dominican salami

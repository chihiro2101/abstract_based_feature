thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used thumb in the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism , the two fluids flow in the same direction as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is the result is thermal equilibrium : both fluids end up at around the same temperature : 40 & nbsp ; °c , almost exactly between the two original temperatures ( 20 and 60 & nbsp ; °c ) at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all if the equilibrium—where both tubes are at the same temperature—is reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes , no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes a similar example is the cocurrent concentration exchange many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine , while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows ( since the salt is not leaving this flow , while water is ) two tubes have a liquid flowing in opposite directions , transferring a property from one tube to the other for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat left in a countercurrent heat exchanger , the hot fluid becomes cold , and the cold fluid becomes hot it warms water in the bottom pipe which has been warmed up along the way , to almost 60 & nbsp ; °c a minute but existing heat difference still exists , and a small amount of heat is transferred , so that the water leaving the bottom pipe is at close to 60 & nbsp ; °c for maximum heat transfer , the average specific heat capacity and the mass flow rate must be the same for each stream if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly image : circulus arteriosus schaf.jpg right thumb 120px rete mirabile rm countercurrent exchange in biological systems occurred following the discovery of countercurrent multiplication systems by werner kuhn countercurrent exchange is used extensively in biological systems for a wide variety of purposes for example , fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood , and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance the incoming flow starting at a low concentration has a semipermeable membrane with water passing to the buffer liquid via osmosis at a small gradient theoretically a similar system could exist or be constructed for heat exchange the tip of the loop has the highest concentration of salt ( nacl ) in the incoming tube—in the example 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l , and in the buffer 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l the returning tube has active transport pumps , pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 & nbsp ; mg/l more than in the tube dopamin inhibits the secretion from the thick descending limb , and angiotensin ii catalyzes it loop of henle descending : the liquid passes from the thin descending limb to the thick ascending limb gradually lowering the concentration in the exiting liquid , but , using the countercurrent multiplier mechanism , always pumping against a constant and small osmotic difference : the liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mosm when leaving the thin ascending limb and passing through the thick one water or liquid with very low osmotic concentration leaving the nephrons is reabsorbed in the peritubular capillaries and returned to the blood as these fluids flow past each other , they create a heat gradient in which heat is transferred and retained inside the body the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system

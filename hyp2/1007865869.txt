thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used thumb in the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism , the two fluids flow in the same direction as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all if the equilibrium—where both tubes are at the same temperature—is reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes , no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes the system consists of two tubes , one with brine ( concentrated saltwater ) , the other with freshwater ( which has a low concentration of salt in it ) , and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two , in an osmosis many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine , while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows ( since the salt is not leaving this flow , while water is ) for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact with a sufficiently long length and a sufficiently low flow rate this can result in almost all of the property transferred so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat left in a countercurrent heat exchanger , the hot fluid becomes cold , and the cold fluid becomes hot in this example , hot water at 60 & nbsp ; °c enters the top pipe it warms water in the bottom pipe which has been warmed up along the way , to almost 60 & nbsp ; °c the result is that the top pipe which received hot water , now has cold water leaving it at 20 & nbsp ; °c , while the bottom pipe which received cold water , is now emitting hot water at close to 60 & nbsp ; °c for maximum heat transfer , the average specific heat capacity and the mass flow rate must be the same for each stream if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly for example , fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood , and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies water passes because of a small osmotic pressure to the buffer liquid in this example at 300 & nbsp ; mg/l ( nacl / h 2 o ) further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer , gradually raising the concentration of nacl in the tube until it reaches 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l at the tip the buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration , always a bit over the incoming fluid , in this example reaching 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l the tip of the loop has the highest concentration of salt ( nacl ) in the incoming tube—in the example 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l , and in the buffer 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l there is no need for a buffer liquid , if the desired effect is receiving a high concentration at the output pipe : for example , the liquid at one section inside the thin descending limb is at 400 mosm while outside it is 401 loop of henle ascending : after the tip ( or 'bend ' ) of the loop , the liquid flows in the thin ascending limb : the liquid finally reaches a low concentration of 100 mosm when leaving the thin ascending limb and passing through the thick one water or liquid with very low osmotic concentration leaving the nephrons is reabsorbed in the peritubular capillaries and returned to the blood proximity of arteries and veins in the leg results in heat exchange , so that as the blood flows down it becomes cooler , and does n't lose much heat to the snow the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system thumb countercurrent chromatography is a method of separation , that is based on the differential partitioning of analytes between two immiscible liquids using countercurrent or cocurrent flow

thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used thumb in the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism , the two fluids flow in the same direction as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism a similar example is the cocurrent concentration exchange this will continue , until both flows reach a similar dilution , with a concentration somewhere close to midway between the two original dilutions two tubes have a liquid flowing in opposite directions , transferring a property from one tube to the other for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat a minute but existing heat difference still exists , and a small amount of heat is transferred , so that the water leaving the bottom pipe is at close to 60 & nbsp ; °c at the cold end—the water exit from the top pipe , because the cold water entering the bottom pipe is still cold at 20 & nbsp ; °c , it can extract the last of the heat from the now-cooled hot water in the top pipe , bringing its temperature down nearly to the level of the cold input fluid ( 21 & nbsp ; °c ) nearly complete transfer in systems implementing countercurrent exchange , is only possible if the two flows are , in some sense , '' equal '' if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly image : circulus arteriosus schaf.jpg right thumb 120px rete mirabile rm countercurrent exchange in biological systems occurred following the discovery of countercurrent multiplication systems by werner kuhn for example , fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood , and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies in vertebrates , this type of organ is referred to as a rete mirabile ( originally the name of the organ in the fish gills ) mammalian kidneys use countercurrent exchange to remove water from urine so the body can retain water used to move the nitrogenous waste products ( see countercurrent multiplier ) a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance a buffer liquid between the incoming and outgoing tubes receives the concentrated substance water passes because of a small osmotic pressure to the buffer liquid in this example at 300 & nbsp ; mg/l ( nacl / h 2 o ) further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer , gradually raising the concentration of nacl in the tube until it reaches 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l at the tip thus when opposite the 1000 & nbsp ; mg/l in the buffer liquid , the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 & nbsp ; mg/l are needed to be pumped out but the same is true anywhere along the line , so that at exit of the loop also only 200 & nbsp ; mg/l need to be pumped the semipermeable membrane of the thin descending limb does not permit passage of ions or large dissolved molecules gradually there is a buildup of osmotic concentration , until 1200 mosm is reached at the loop tip , but the difference across the membrane is kept small and constant loop of henle ascending : after the tip ( or 'bend ' ) of the loop , the liquid flows in the thin ascending limb gradually lowering the concentration in the exiting liquid , but , using the countercurrent multiplier mechanism , always pumping against a constant and small osmotic difference pumps further up the thin ascending limb , pump out from 400 mosm into liquid at 600 mosm , so again the difference is retained at 200 mosm from the inside to the outside , while the concentration both inside and outside are gradually decreasing as the liquid flow advances although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood , the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange , so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system

thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used thumb in the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism , the two fluids flow in the same direction as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism the hot fluid heats the cold one , and the cold fluid cools down the warm one the result is thermal equilibrium : both fluids end up at around the same temperature : 40 & nbsp ; °c , almost exactly between the two original temperatures ( 20 and 60 & nbsp ; °c ) at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all if the equilibrium—where both tubes are at the same temperature—is reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes , no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes a similar example is the cocurrent concentration exchange many of the water molecules pass from the freshwater flow in order to dilute the brine , while the concentration of salt in the freshwater constantly grows ( since the salt is not leaving this flow , while water is ) thumb in countercurrent flow , the two flows move in opposite directions two tubes have a liquid flowing in opposite directions , transferring a property from one tube to the other for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat left in a countercurrent heat exchanger , the hot fluid becomes cold , and the cold fluid becomes hot because the hot input is at its maximum temperature of 60 & nbsp ; °c , and the exiting water at the bottom pipe is nearly at that temperature but not quite , the water in the top pipe can warm the one in the bottom pipe to nearly its own temperature nearly complete transfer in systems implementing countercurrent exchange , is only possible if the two flows are , in some sense , '' equal '' for maximum heat transfer , the average specific heat capacity and the mass flow rate must be the same for each stream image : circulus arteriosus schaf.jpg right thumb 120px rete mirabile rm countercurrent exchange in biological systems occurred following the discovery of countercurrent multiplication systems by werner kuhn mammalian kidneys use countercurrent exchange to remove water from urine so the body can retain water used to move the nitrogenous waste products ( see countercurrent multiplier ) a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance the incoming flow starting at a low concentration has a semipermeable membrane with water passing to the buffer liquid via osmosis at a small gradient theoretically a similar system could exist or be constructed for heat exchange the buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration , always a bit over the incoming fluid , in this example reaching 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l the returning tube has active transport pumps , pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 & nbsp ; mg/l more than in the tube thus when opposite the 1000 & nbsp ; mg/l in the buffer liquid , the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 & nbsp ; mg/l are needed to be pumped out there is no need for a buffer liquid , if the desired effect is receiving a high concentration at the output pipe countercurrent exchange in sea and desert birds to conserve water although the fluid in the tubules is with a higher concentration of salt than the blood , the flow is arranged in a countercurrent exchange , so that the blood with a high concentration of salt enters the system close to where the gland tubules exit and connect to the main canal thumb countercurrent chromatography is a method of separation , that is based on the differential partitioning of analytes between two immiscible liquids using countercurrent or cocurrent flow

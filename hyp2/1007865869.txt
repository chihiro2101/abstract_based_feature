thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger with equal flows in the two tubes , this method of exchange is only capable of moving half of the property from one flow to the other , no matter how long the exchanger is if each stream changes its property to be 50 % closer to that of the opposite stream 's inlet condition , exchange will stop when the point of equilibrium is reached , and the gradient has declined to zero in the case of unequal flows , the equilibrium condition will occur somewhat closer to the conditions of the stream with the higher flow thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism if the equilibrium—where both tubes are at the same temperature—is reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes , no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes a similar example is the cocurrent concentration exchange the system consists of two tubes , one with brine ( concentrated saltwater ) , the other with freshwater ( which has a low concentration of salt in it ) , and a semi permeable membrane which allows only water to pass between the two , in an osmosis once that happens , there will be no more flow between the two tubes , since both are at a similar dilution and there is no more osmotic pressure for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat left in a countercurrent heat exchanger , the hot fluid becomes cold , and the cold fluid becomes hot nearly complete transfer in systems implementing countercurrent exchange , is only possible if the two flows are , in some sense , '' equal '' if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly the specific heat capacity should be calculated on a mass basis , averaged over the temperature range involved countercurrent exchange in biological systems countercurrent exchange is used extensively in biological systems for a wide variety of purposes for example , fish use it in their gills to transfer oxygen from the surrounding water into their blood , and birds use a countercurrent heat exchanger between blood vessels in their legs to keep heat concentrated within their bodies a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance there is a gradual buildup of concentration inside the loop until the loop tip where it reaches its maximum water passes because of a small osmotic pressure to the buffer liquid in this example at 300 & nbsp ; mg/l ( nacl / h 2 o ) further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer , gradually raising the concentration of nacl in the tube until it reaches 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l at the tip the buffer liquid between the two tubes is at a gradually rising concentration , always a bit over the incoming fluid , in this example reaching 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l thus when opposite the 1000 & nbsp ; mg/l in the buffer liquid , the concentration in the tube is 800 and only 200 & nbsp ; mg/l are needed to be pumped out the active transport pumps need only to overcome a constant and low gradient of concentration , because of the countercurrent multiplier mechanism see the countercurrent multiplier animation at the colorado university website loop of henle ascending : after the tip ( or 'bend ' ) of the loop , the liquid flows in the thin ascending limb since the arteries give up a good deal of their heat in this exchange , there is less heat lost through convection at the periphery surface the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system lime can be manufactured in countercurrent furnaces allowing the heat to reach high temperatures using low cost , low temperature burning fuel

thumb countercurrent exchange along with cocurrent exchange and contra-current exchange comprise the mechanisms used to transfer some property of a fluid from one flowing current of fluid to another across a barrier allowing one way flow of the property between them the property transferred could be heat , concentration of a chemical substance , or other properties of the flow when heat is transferred , a thermally-conductive membrane is used between the two tubes , and when the concentration of a chemical substance is transferred a semipermeable membrane is used thumb in the cocurrent flow exchange mechanism , the two fluids flow in the same direction as the cocurrent and countercurrent exchange mechanisms diagram showed , a cocurrent exchange system has a variable gradient over the length of the exchanger thumb a cocurrent heat exchanger is an example of a cocurrent flow exchange mechanism a thermoconductive membrane or an open section allows heat transfer between the two flows the result is thermal equilibrium : both fluids end up at around the same temperature : 40 & nbsp ; °c , almost exactly between the two original temperatures ( 20 and 60 & nbsp ; °c ) at the input end , there is a large temperature difference of 40 & nbsp ; °c and much heat transfer ; at the output end , there is a very small temperature difference ( both are at the same temperature of 40 & nbsp ; °c or close to it ) , and very little heat transfer if any at all if the equilibrium—where both tubes are at the same temperature—is reached before the exit of the liquid from the tubes , no further heat transfer will be achieved along the remaining length of the tubes once that happens , there will be no more flow between the two tubes , since both are at a similar dilution and there is no more osmotic pressure thumb in countercurrent flow , the two flows move in opposite directions two tubes have a liquid flowing in opposite directions , transferring a property from one tube to the other for example , this could be transferring heat from a hot flow of liquid to a cold one , or transferring the concentration of a dissolved solute from a high concentration flow of liquid to a low concentration flow the counter-current exchange system can maintain a nearly constant gradient between the two flows over their entire length of contact so , for example , in the case of heat exchange , the exiting liquid will be almost as hot as the original incoming liquid 's heat a minute but existing heat difference still exists , and a small amount of heat is transferred , so that the water leaving the bottom pipe is at close to 60 & nbsp ; °c for maximum heat transfer , the average specific heat capacity and the mass flow rate must be the same for each stream if the two flows are not equal , for example if heat is being transferred from water to air or vice versa , then , similar to cocurrent exchange systems , a variation in the gradient is expected because of a buildup of the property not being transferred properly image : circulus arteriosus schaf.jpg right thumb 120px rete mirabile rm countercurrent exchange in biological systems occurred following the discovery of countercurrent multiplication systems by werner kuhn countercurrent exchange is used extensively in biological systems for a wide variety of purposes mammalian kidneys use countercurrent exchange to remove water from urine so the body can retain water used to move the nitrogenous waste products ( see countercurrent multiplier ) a countercurrent multiplication loop is a system where fluid flows in a loop so that the entrance and exit are at similar low concentration of a dissolved substance but at the far end of the loop there is a high concentration of that substance in the example shown in the image , water enters at 299 & nbsp ; mg/l ( nacl / h 2 o ) further up the loop there is a continued flow of water out of the tube and into the buffer , gradually raising the concentration of nacl in the tube until it reaches 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l at the tip the tip of the loop has the highest concentration of salt ( nacl ) in the incoming tube—in the example 1199 & nbsp ; mg/l , and in the buffer 1200 & nbsp ; mg/l the returning tube has active transport pumps , pumping salt out to the buffer liquid at a low difference of concentrations of up to 200 & nbsp ; mg/l more than in the tube the active transport pumps need only to overcome a constant and low gradient of concentration , because of the countercurrent multiplier mechanism see the countercurrent multiplier animation at the colorado university website various substances are passed from the liquid entering the nephrons until exiting the loop ( see the nephron flow diagram ) beginning with the afferent arteriole , a blood vessel leading to the glomerulus , filtered blood is passed to the nephrons in the bowman 's capsule which surrounds the glomerulus countercurrent exchange of heat in organisms a salt extraction system with a countercurrent multiplication mechanism , where salt is actively pumped from the blood 'venules ' ( small veins ) into the gland tubules the blood supply system to the gland is set in countercurrent exchange loop mechanism for keeping the high concentration of salt in the gland 's blood , so that it does n't leave back to the blood system

the first reported clinical trial was conducted by james lind in 1747 to identify treatment for scurvy randomized experiments appeared in psychology , where they were introduced by charles sanders peirce and joseph jastrow in the 1880s , and in education later , in the early 20th century , randomized experiments appeared in agriculture , due to jerzy neyman neyman , jerzy , a fact which led henry mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his well known treatise , '' page 87 : the first published rct in medicine appeared in the 1948 paper entitled '' streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis '' , which described a medical research council investigation one of the authors of that paper was austin bradford hill , who is credited as having conceived the modern rct trial design was further influenced by the large-scale isis trials on heart attack treatments that were conducted in the 1980s to improve the reporting of rcts in the medical literature , an international group of scientists and editors published consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) statements in 1996 , 2001 and 2010 , and these have become widely accepted randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias about the preferred treatment '' ) common to clinical trials has been applied to rcts , the ethics of rcts have special considerations for example , patients with terminal illness may join trials in the hope of being cured , even when treatments are unlikely to be successful medical journals have been slow in adapting policies requiring mandatory clinical trial registration as a prerequisite for publication crossover – over time , each participant receives ( or does not receive ) an intervention in a random sequence factorial – each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions ( e.g , group 1 receives vitamin x and vitamin y , group 2 receives vitamin x and placebo y , group 3 receives placebo x and vitamin y , and group 4 receives placebo x and placebo y ) an analysis of the 616 rcts indexed in pubmed during december 2006 found that 78 % were parallel-group trials , 16 % were crossover , 2 % were split-body , 2 % were cluster , and 2 % were factorial '' explanatory rcts test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions in contrast , pragmatic rcts ( prcts ) test effectiveness in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions ; in this way , pragmatic rcts can '' inform decisions about practice another classification of rcts categorizes them as '' superiority trials '' , '' noninferiority trials '' , and '' equivalence trials '' , which differ in methodology and reporting most rcts are superiority trials , in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a statistical significance way some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment the advantages of proper randomization in rcts include : '' it eliminates bias in treatment assignment , '' specifically selection bias and confounding non-random '' systematic '' methods of group assignment , such as alternating subjects between one group and the other , can cause '' limitless contamination possibilities '' and can cause a breach of allocation concealment generally , equal group sizes maximize statistical power , however , unequal groups sizes may be more powerful for some analyses ( e.g the risk of selection bias is highest when previous treatment assignments are known ( as in unblinded studies ) or can be guessed ( perhaps if a drug has distinctive side effects ) however , no single randomization procedure meets those goals in every circumstance , so researchers must select a procedure for a given study based on its advantages and disadvantages '' a special case of permuted-block randomization is random allocation , in which the entire sample is treated as one block another disadvantage is that '' proper '' analysis of data from permuted-block-randomized rcts requires stratification by blocks the methods are thought to be less affected by selection bias than permuted-block randomization '' minimization is reported to have '' supporters and detractors '' because only the first subject 's group assignment is truly chosen at random , the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors response-adaptive randomization , also known as outcome-adaptive randomization : the probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable although arguments have been made that this approach is more ethical than other types of randomization when the probability that a treatment is effective or ineffective increases during the course of an rct , ethicists have not yet studied the approach in detail adequate allocation concealment should defeat patients and investigators from discovering treatment allocation once a study is underway and after the study has concluded on the other hand , a 2008 study of 146 meta-analysis concluded that the results of rcts with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the rcts ' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective if the effect of the treatment is small , the number of treatment units in either group may be insufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis in the respective statistical test '' unlike allocation concealment , blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an rct ; for example , if an rct involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary ( e.g , kaplan–meier estimators and cox proportional hazards models for time to coronary heart disease after receipt of hormone replacement therapy ( menopause ) ) is appropriate for example , rcts may be stopped early if an intervention produces '' larger than expected benefit or harm '' , or if '' investigators find evidence of no important difference between experimental and control interventions nevertheless , the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized , the less bias that an rct will be subject to ethically it may be necessary to abort the rct prematurely , and getting ethics approval ( and patient agreement ) to withhold the innovation from the control group in future rct 's may not be feasible they concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research

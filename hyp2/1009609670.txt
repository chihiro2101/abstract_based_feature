the first reported clinical trial was conducted by james lind in 1747 to identify treatment for scurvy randomized experiments appeared in psychology , where they were introduced by charles sanders peirce and joseph jastrow in the 1880s , and in education fisher 's experimental research and his writings popularized randomized experiments the mathematical justification of the methods described was not stressed and , indeed , proofs were often barely sketched or omitted altogether '' page 87 : the first published rct in medicine appeared in the 1948 paper entitled '' streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis '' , which described a medical research council investigation trial design was further influenced by the large-scale isis trials on heart attack treatments that were conducted in the 1980s randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias although the principle of clinical equipoise ( '' genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community about the preferred treatment '' ) common to clinical trials has been applied to rcts , the ethics of rcts have special considerations '' although subjects almost always provide informed consent for their participation in an rct , studies since 1982 have documented that rct subjects may believe that they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally ; that is , they do not understand the difference between research and treatment , villages , schools ) are randomly selected to receive ( or not receive ) an intervention factorial â€“ each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions ( e.g , group 1 receives vitamin x and vitamin y , group 2 receives vitamin x and placebo y , group 3 receives placebo x and vitamin y , and group 4 receives placebo x and placebo y ) in contrast , pragmatic rcts ( prcts ) test effectiveness in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions ; in this way , pragmatic rcts can '' inform decisions about practice another classification of rcts categorizes them as '' superiority trials '' , '' noninferiority trials '' , and '' equivalence trials '' , which differ in methodology and reporting most rcts are superiority trials , in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a statistical significance way some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment the advantages of proper randomization in rcts include : '' it eliminates bias in treatment assignment , '' specifically selection bias and confounding '' a second and more practical issue is allocation concealment , which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups generally , equal group sizes maximize statistical power , however , unequal groups sizes may be more powerful for some analyses ( e.g , multiple comparisons of placebo versus several doses using dunnett 's procedure ) , and are sometimes desired for non-analytic reasons ( e.g , patients may be more motivated to enroll if there is a higher chance of getting the test treatment , or regulatory agencies may require a minimum number of patients exposed to treatment ) this may occur when covariates that affect the outcome are not equally distributed between treatment groups , and the treatment effect is confounded with the effect of the covariates ( i.e the major types of restricted randomization used in rcts are : randomized block design or blocked randomization : a '' block size '' and '' allocation ratio '' ( number of subjects in one group versus the other group ) are specified , and subjects are allocated randomly within each block for example , a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 would lead to random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other this type of randomization can be combined with '' stratified randomization '' , for example by center in a multicenter trial , to '' ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group the major disadvantage of permuted-block randomization is that even if the block sizes are large and randomly varied , the procedure can lead to selection bias another disadvantage is that '' proper '' analysis of data from permuted-block-randomized rcts requires stratification by blocks '' minimization is reported to have '' supporters and detractors '' because only the first subject 's group assignment is truly chosen at random , the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors '' allocation concealment '' ( defined as '' the procedure for protecting the randomization process so that the treatment to be allocated is not known before the patient is entered into the study '' ) is important in rcts in practice , clinical investigators in rcts often find it difficult to maintain impartiality such practices introduce selection bias and confounders ( both of which should be minimized by randomization ) , possibly distorting the results of the study the number of treatment units ( subjects or groups of subjects ) assigned to control and treatment groups , affects an rct 's reliability the failure to reject the null hypothesis would imply that the treatment shows no statistically significant effect on the treated in a given test but as the sample size increases , the same rct may be able to demonstrate a significant effect of the treatment , even if this effect is small '' unlike allocation concealment , blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an rct ; for example , if an rct involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary ( e.g nevertheless , the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized , the less bias that an rct will be subject to rcts are considered to be the most reliable form of scientific method in the hierarchy of evidence that influences healthcare policy and practice because rcts reduce spurious causality and bias one possible reason for the pro-industry results in industry-funded published rcts is publication bias ethically it may be necessary to abort the rct prematurely , and getting ethics approval ( and patient agreement ) to withhold the innovation from the control group in future rct 's may not be feasible another 2009 study randomized classrooms for 678 first-grade children to receive a classroom-centered intervention , a parent-centered intervention , or no intervention , and then followed their academic outcomes through age 19

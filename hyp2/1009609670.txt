the first reported clinical trial was conducted by james lind in 1747 to identify treatment for scurvy later , in the early 20th century , randomized experiments appeared in agriculture , due to jerzy neyman neyman , jerzy fisher 's experimental research and his writings popularized randomized experiments '' page 87 : the first published rct in medicine appeared in the 1948 paper entitled '' streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis '' , which described a medical research council investigation to improve the reporting of rcts in the medical literature , an international group of scientists and editors published consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) statements in 1996 , 2001 and 2010 , and these have become widely accepted randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias about the preferred treatment '' ) common to clinical trials has been applied to rcts , the ethics of rcts have special considerations for one , it has been argued that equipoise itself is insufficient to justify rcts , a personal belief that an intervention is effective ) finally , zelen 's design , which has been used for some rcts , randomizes subjects before they provide informed consent , which may be ethical for rcts of screening and selected therapies , but is likely unethical '' for most therapeutic trials for example , patients with terminal illness may join trials in the hope of being cured , even when treatments are unlikely to be successful in 2004 , the international committee of medical journal editors ( icmje ) announced that all trials starting enrolment after july 1 , 2005 must be registered prior to consideration for publication in one of the 12 member journals of the committee however , trial registration may still occur late or not at all one way to classify rcts is by study design cluster – pre-existing groups of participants ( e.g , villages , schools ) are randomly selected to receive ( or not receive ) an intervention factorial – each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions ( e.g , group 1 receives vitamin x and vitamin y , group 2 receives vitamin x and placebo y , group 3 receives placebo x and vitamin y , and group 4 receives placebo x and placebo y ) in contrast , pragmatic rcts ( prcts ) test effectiveness in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions ; in this way , pragmatic rcts can '' inform decisions about practice another classification of rcts categorizes them as '' superiority trials '' , '' noninferiority trials '' , and '' equivalence trials '' , which differ in methodology and reporting most rcts are superiority trials , in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a statistical significance way some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment '' a second and more practical issue is allocation concealment , which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups non-random '' systematic '' methods of group assignment , such as alternating subjects between one group and the other , can cause '' limitless contamination possibilities '' and can cause a breach of allocation concealment however empirical evidence that adequate randomization changes outcomes relative to inadequate randomization has been difficult to detect the treatment allocation is the desired proportion of patients in each treatment arm an ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals : maximize statistical power , especially in subgroup analysis this may occur if investigators can consciously or unconsciously preferentially enroll patients between treatment arms a good randomization procedure will be unpredictable so that investigators can not guess the next subject 's group assignment based on prior treatment assignments this may occur when covariates that affect the outcome are not equally distributed between treatment groups , and the treatment effect is confounded with the effect of the covariates ( i.e for example , a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 would lead to random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other adaptive biased-coin randomization methods ( of which urn randomization is the most widely known type ) : in these relatively uncommon methods , the probability of being assigned to a group decreases if the group is overrepresented and increases if the group is underrepresented the methods are thought to be less affected by selection bias than permuted-block randomization the number of treatment units ( subjects or groups of subjects ) assigned to control and treatment groups , affects an rct 's reliability if the effect of the treatment is small , the number of treatment units in either group may be insufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis in the respective statistical test the failure to reject the null hypothesis would imply that the treatment shows no statistically significant effect on the treated in a given test but as the sample size increases , the same rct may be able to demonstrate a significant effect of the treatment , even if this effect is small '' unlike allocation concealment , blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an rct ; for example , if an rct involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary ( e.g the 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) ethically it may be necessary to abort the rct prematurely , and getting ethics approval ( and patient agreement ) to withhold the innovation from the control group in future rct 's may not be feasible they concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research

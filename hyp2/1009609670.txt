the first reported clinical trial was conducted by james lind in 1747 to identify treatment for scurvy '' page 87 : the first published rct in medicine appeared in the 1948 paper entitled '' streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis '' , which described a medical research council investigation one of the authors of that paper was austin bradford hill , who is credited as having conceived the modern rct to improve the reporting of rcts in the medical literature , an international group of scientists and editors published consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) statements in 1996 , 2001 and 2010 , and these have become widely accepted randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias about the preferred treatment '' ) common to clinical trials has been applied to rcts , the ethics of rcts have special considerations in 2004 , the international committee of medical journal editors ( icmje ) announced that all trials starting enrolment after july 1 , 2005 must be registered prior to consideration for publication in one of the 12 member journals of the committee however , trial registration may still occur late or not at all medical journals have been slow in adapting policies requiring mandatory clinical trial registration as a prerequisite for publication cluster – pre-existing groups of participants ( e.g factorial – each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions ( e.g , group 1 receives vitamin x and vitamin y , group 2 receives vitamin x and placebo y , group 3 receives placebo x and vitamin y , and group 4 receives placebo x and placebo y ) an analysis of the 616 rcts indexed in pubmed during december 2006 found that 78 % were parallel-group trials , 16 % were crossover , 2 % were split-body , 2 % were cluster , and 2 % were factorial '' explanatory rcts test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions another classification of rcts categorizes them as '' superiority trials '' , '' noninferiority trials '' , and '' equivalence trials '' , which differ in methodology and reporting some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment the advantages of proper randomization in rcts include : '' it eliminates bias in treatment assignment , '' specifically selection bias and confounding '' '' it permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance however empirical evidence that adequate randomization changes outcomes relative to inadequate randomization has been difficult to detect the treatment allocation is the desired proportion of patients in each treatment arm generally , equal group sizes maximize statistical power , however , unequal groups sizes may be more powerful for some analyses ( e.g , patients may be more motivated to enroll if there is a higher chance of getting the test treatment , or regulatory agencies may require a minimum number of patients exposed to treatment ) the risk of selection bias is highest when previous treatment assignments are known ( as in unblinded studies ) or can be guessed ( perhaps if a drug has distinctive side effects ) this may occur when covariates that affect the outcome are not equally distributed between treatment groups , and the treatment effect is confounded with the effect of the covariates ( i.e , an '' accidental bias '' ) however , no single randomization procedure meets those goals in every circumstance , so researchers must select a procedure for a given study based on its advantages and disadvantages it is therefore recommended only for rcts with over 200 subjects this type of randomization can be combined with '' stratified randomization '' , for example by center in a multicenter trial , to '' ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group '' a special case of permuted-block randomization is random allocation , in which the entire sample is treated as one block '' minimization is reported to have '' supporters and detractors '' because only the first subject 's group assignment is truly chosen at random , the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors response-adaptive randomization , also known as outcome-adaptive randomization : the probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable although arguments have been made that this approach is more ethical than other types of randomization when the probability that a treatment is effective or ineffective increases during the course of an rct , ethicists have not yet studied the approach in detail in practice , clinical investigators in rcts often find it difficult to maintain impartiality stories abound of investigators holding up sealed envelopes to lights or ransacking offices to determine group assignments in order to dictate the assignment of their next patient such practices introduce selection bias and confounders ( both of which should be minimized by randomization ) , possibly distorting the results of the study if the effect of the treatment is small , the number of treatment units in either group may be insufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis in the respective statistical test the failure to reject the null hypothesis would imply that the treatment shows no statistically significant effect on the treated in a given test nevertheless , the more that analyses can include all participants in the groups to which they were randomized , the less bias that an rct will be subject to ethically it may be necessary to abort the rct prematurely , and getting ethics approval ( and patient agreement ) to withhold the innovation from the control group in future rct 's may not be feasible they concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research another 2009 study randomized classrooms for 678 first-grade children to receive a classroom-centered intervention , a parent-centered intervention , or no intervention , and then followed their academic outcomes through age 19

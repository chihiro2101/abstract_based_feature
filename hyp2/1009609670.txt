later , in the early 20th century , randomized experiments appeared in agriculture , due to jerzy neyman neyman , jerzy fisher was '' interested in application and in the popularization of statistical methods and his early book statistical methods for research workers , published in 1925 , went through many editions and motivated and influenced the practical use of statistics in many fields of study , a fact which led henry mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his well known treatise , to improve the reporting of rcts in the medical literature , an international group of scientists and editors published consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) statements in 1996 , 2001 and 2010 , and these have become widely accepted randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias for another , '' collective equipoise '' can conflict with a lack of personal equipoise ( e.g finally , zelen 's design , which has been used for some rcts , randomizes subjects before they provide informed consent , which may be ethical for rcts of screening and selected therapies , but is likely unethical '' for most therapeutic trials for example , patients with terminal illness may join trials in the hope of being cured , even when treatments are unlikely to be successful one way to classify rcts is by study design from most to least common in the healthcare literature , the major categories of rct study designs are : parallel study – each participant is randomly assigned to a group , and all the participants in the group receive ( or do not receive ) an intervention factorial – each participant is randomly assigned to a group that receives a particular combination of interventions or non-interventions ( e.g '' explanatory rcts test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment the advantages of proper randomization in rcts include : '' it eliminates bias in treatment assignment , '' specifically selection bias and confounding '' '' it permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance first is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations ; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities , may be '' restricted '' , or may be '' adaptive non-random '' systematic '' methods of group assignment , such as alternating subjects between one group and the other , can cause '' limitless contamination possibilities '' and can cause a breach of allocation concealment however empirical evidence that adequate randomization changes outcomes relative to inadequate randomization has been difficult to detect the treatment allocation is the desired proportion of patients in each treatment arm an ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals : maximize statistical power , especially in subgroup analysis , patients may be more motivated to enroll if there is a higher chance of getting the test treatment , or regulatory agencies may require a minimum number of patients exposed to treatment ) this may occur if investigators can consciously or unconsciously preferentially enroll patients between treatment arms a good randomization procedure will be unpredictable so that investigators can not guess the next subject 's group assignment based on prior treatment assignments '' also known as '' complete '' or '' unrestricted '' randomization , it is robust against both selection and accidental biases however , its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small rcts this type of randomization can be combined with '' stratified randomization '' , for example by center in a multicenter trial , to '' ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group '' a special case of permuted-block randomization is random allocation , in which the entire sample is treated as one block adaptive biased-coin randomization methods ( of which urn randomization is the most widely known type ) : in these relatively uncommon methods , the probability of being assigned to a group decreases if the group is overrepresented and increases if the group is underrepresented at least two types of '' adaptive '' randomization procedures have been used in rcts , but much less frequently than simple or restricted randomization : covariate-adaptive randomization , of which one type is minimization : the probability of being assigned to a group varies in order to minimize '' covariate imbalance '' minimization is reported to have '' supporters and detractors '' because only the first subject 's group assignment is truly chosen at random , the method does not necessarily eliminate bias on unknown factors response-adaptive randomization , also known as outcome-adaptive randomization : the probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable '' allocation concealment '' ( defined as '' the procedure for protecting the randomization process so that the treatment to be allocated is not known before the patient is entered into the study '' ) is important in rcts in practice , clinical investigators in rcts often find it difficult to maintain impartiality such practices introduce selection bias and confounders ( both of which should be minimized by randomization ) , possibly distorting the results of the study some standard methods of ensuring allocation concealment include sequentially numbered , opaque , sealed envelopes ( snose ) ; sequentially numbered containers ; pharmacy controlled randomization ; and central randomization on the other hand , a 2008 study of 146 meta-analysis concluded that the results of rcts with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the rcts ' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective the failure to reject the null hypothesis would imply that the treatment shows no statistically significant effect on the treated in a given test two studies published in the new england journal of medicine in 2000 found that observational study and rcts overall produced similar results , a rare side effect of a drug ) would require rcts with extremely large sample sizes and may , therefore , best be assessed by observational studies a systematic review published in 2003 found four 1986–2002 articles comparing industry-sponsored and nonindustry-sponsored rcts , and in all the articles there was a correlation of industry sponsorship and positive study outcome they concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research

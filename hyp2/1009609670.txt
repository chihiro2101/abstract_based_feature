the first reported clinical trial was conducted by james lind in 1747 to identify treatment for scurvy randomized experiments appeared in psychology , where they were introduced by charles sanders peirce and joseph jastrow in the 1880s , and in education later , in the early 20th century , randomized experiments appeared in agriculture , due to jerzy neyman neyman , jerzy , a fact which led henry mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his well known treatise , one of the authors of that paper was austin bradford hill , who is credited as having conceived the modern rct to improve the reporting of rcts in the medical literature , an international group of scientists and editors published consolidated standards of reporting trials ( consort ) statements in 1996 , 2001 and 2010 , and these have become widely accepted randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias about the preferred treatment '' ) common to clinical trials has been applied to rcts , the ethics of rcts have special considerations finally , zelen 's design , which has been used for some rcts , randomizes subjects before they provide informed consent , which may be ethical for rcts of screening and selected therapies , but is likely unethical '' for most therapeutic trials for example , patients with terminal illness may join trials in the hope of being cured , even when treatments are unlikely to be successful in 2004 , the international committee of medical journal editors ( icmje ) announced that all trials starting enrolment after july 1 , 2005 must be registered prior to consideration for publication in one of the 12 member journals of the committee however , trial registration may still occur late or not at all from most to least common in the healthcare literature , the major categories of rct study designs are : parallel study – each participant is randomly assigned to a group , and all the participants in the group receive ( or do not receive ) an intervention , group 1 receives vitamin x and vitamin y , group 2 receives vitamin x and placebo y , group 3 receives placebo x and vitamin y , and group 4 receives placebo x and placebo y ) '' explanatory rcts test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions in contrast , pragmatic rcts ( prcts ) test effectiveness in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions ; in this way , pragmatic rcts can '' inform decisions about practice another classification of rcts categorizes them as '' superiority trials '' , '' noninferiority trials '' , and '' equivalence trials '' , which differ in methodology and reporting most rcts are superiority trials , in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a statistical significance way some rcts are noninferiority trials '' to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment '' other rcts are equivalence trials in which the hypothesis is that two interventions are indistinguishable from each other first is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations ; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities , may be '' restricted '' , or may be '' adaptive non-random '' systematic '' methods of group assignment , such as alternating subjects between one group and the other , can cause '' limitless contamination possibilities '' and can cause a breach of allocation concealment an ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals : maximize statistical power , especially in subgroup analysis generally , equal group sizes maximize statistical power , however , unequal groups sizes may be more powerful for some analyses ( e.g a good randomization procedure will be unpredictable so that investigators can not guess the next subject 's group assignment based on prior treatment assignments to balance group sizes in smaller rcts , some form of restricted randomization is recommended the major types of restricted randomization used in rcts are : randomized block design or blocked randomization : a '' block size '' and '' allocation ratio '' ( number of subjects in one group versus the other group ) are specified , and subjects are allocated randomly within each block this type of randomization can be combined with '' stratified randomization '' , for example by center in a multicenter trial , to '' ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group another disadvantage is that '' proper '' analysis of data from permuted-block-randomized rcts requires stratification by blocks the methods are thought to be less affected by selection bias than permuted-block randomization response-adaptive randomization , also known as outcome-adaptive randomization : the probability of being assigned to a group increases if the responses of the prior patients in the group were favorable stories abound of investigators holding up sealed envelopes to lights or ransacking offices to determine group assignments in order to dictate the assignment of their next patient such practices introduce selection bias and confounders ( both of which should be minimized by randomization ) , possibly distorting the results of the study adequate allocation concealment should defeat patients and investigators from discovering treatment allocation once a study is underway and after the study has concluded on the other hand , a 2008 study of 146 meta-analysis concluded that the results of rcts with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the rcts ' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective the number of treatment units ( subjects or groups of subjects ) assigned to control and treatment groups , affects an rct 's reliability rcts may be unnecessary for treatments that have dramatic and rapid effects relative to the expected stable or progressively worse natural course of the condition treated the 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) a 2004 study of 1999–2001 rcts published in leading medical and surgical journals determined that industry-funded rcts '' are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings ethically it may be necessary to abort the rct prematurely , and getting ethics approval ( and patient agreement ) to withhold the innovation from the control group in future rct 's may not be feasible another 2009 study randomized classrooms for 678 first-grade children to receive a classroom-centered intervention , a parent-centered intervention , or no intervention , and then followed their academic outcomes through age 19

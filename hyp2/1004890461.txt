long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; μm and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away some long-wave cameras require their detector to be cryogenics cooled , typically for several minutes before use , although some moderately sensitive infrared cameras do not require this many thermal imagers , including some forward-looking infrared cameras ( such as some lwir synthetic vision system ( evs ) ) are also uncooled many camera systems use digital image processing to improve the image quality infrared imaging sensor arrays often have wildly inconsistent sensitivities from pixel to pixel , due to limitations in the manufacturing process thermal imaging cameras , such as the raytheon an/aaq-26 , are used in a variety of applications , including naval vessels , fixed-wing aircraft , helicopters , and armored fighting vehicles the term '' forward-looking '' is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems , also known as '' push broom '' imagers , and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems , handheld imaging systems and the like in 1956 texas instruments began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and , with the addition of a second scan mirror , the invention of the first forward-looking infrared camera in 1963 , with production beginning in 1966 infrared technology and applications xli , 20–23 april 2015 , part of proceedings of spie , vol infra-red search and track electro-optical targeting system night vision automotive night vision thermographic camera general : surveillance

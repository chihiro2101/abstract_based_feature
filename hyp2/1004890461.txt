long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; Î¼m and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away many thermal imagers , including some forward-looking infrared cameras ( such as some lwir synthetic vision system ( evs ) ) are also uncooled these can see almost as well , since those frequencies are less affected by water-vapor absorption , but generally require a more expensive sensor array , along with cryogenic cooling thermal imaging cameras , such as the raytheon an/aaq-26 , are used in a variety of applications , including naval vessels , fixed-wing aircraft , helicopters , and armored fighting vehicles in warfare , they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies : the imager itself is nearly impossible to detect for the enemy , as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target , as with radar or sonar these camera systems can see through smoke , fog , haze , and other atmospheric obscurants better than a visible light camera can the term '' forward-looking '' is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems , also known as '' push broom '' imagers , and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems , handheld imaging systems and the like in 2001 , the united states supreme court decided that performing surveillance of private property ( ostensibly to detect high emission grow lights used in clandestine cannabis farming ) using thermal imaging cameras without a search warrant by law enforcement violates the fourth amendment 's protection from unreasonable searches and seizures fbi spy planes used thermal imaging tech in flights over baltimore after freddie gray unrest , the washington post , october 30 , 2015 a flir talon multi-sensor camera system equipped with an infrared laser pointer ( which is invisible to casual observers ) for illumination purposes was used to gather data at night infra-red search and track electro-optical targeting system night vision automotive night vision thermographic camera general : surveillance

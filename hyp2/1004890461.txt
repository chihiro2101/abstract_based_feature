long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; Î¼m and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away some long-wave cameras require their detector to be cryogenics cooled , typically for several minutes before use , although some moderately sensitive infrared cameras do not require this many thermal imagers , including some forward-looking infrared cameras ( such as some lwir synthetic vision system ( evs ) ) are also uncooled many camera systems use digital image processing to improve the image quality thermal imaging cameras , such as the raytheon an/aaq-26 , are used in a variety of applications , including naval vessels , fixed-wing aircraft , helicopters , and armored fighting vehicles in warfare , they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies : the imager itself is nearly impossible to detect for the enemy , as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target , as with radar or sonar these camera systems can see through smoke , fog , haze , and other atmospheric obscurants better than a visible light camera can the term '' forward-looking '' is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems , also known as '' push broom '' imagers , and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems , handheld imaging systems and the like in 1956 texas instruments began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and , with the addition of a second scan mirror , the invention of the first forward-looking infrared camera in 1963 , with production beginning in 1966 infra-red search and track electro-optical targeting system night vision automotive night vision thermographic camera general : surveillance

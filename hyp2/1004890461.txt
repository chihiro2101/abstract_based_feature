long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; Î¼m and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away some long-wave cameras require their detector to be cryogenics cooled , typically for several minutes before use , although some moderately sensitive infrared cameras do not require this many thermal imagers , including some forward-looking infrared cameras ( such as some lwir synthetic vision system ( evs ) ) are also uncooled many camera systems use digital image processing to improve the image quality some companies offer advanced '' fusion '' technologies that blend a visible-spectrum image with an infrared-spectrum image to produce better results than a single-spectrum image alone the term '' forward-looking '' is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems , also known as '' push broom '' imagers , and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems , handheld imaging systems and the like in 1956 texas instruments began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and , with the addition of a second scan mirror , the invention of the first forward-looking infrared camera in 1963 , with production beginning in 1966 the cost of thermal imaging equipment in general has fallen dramatically after inexpensive portable and fixed infrared detectors and systems based on microelectromechanical systems were designed and manufactured for commercial , industrial and military application uncooled infrared imaging arrays and systems ( vol infra-red search and track electro-optical targeting system night vision automotive night vision thermographic camera general : surveillance

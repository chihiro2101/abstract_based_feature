long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; Î¼m and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away some long-wave cameras require their detector to be cryogenics cooled , typically for several minutes before use , although some moderately sensitive infrared cameras do not require this many thermal imagers , including some forward-looking infrared cameras ( such as some lwir synthetic vision system ( evs ) ) are also uncooled many camera systems use digital image processing to improve the image quality thermal imaging cameras , such as the raytheon an/aaq-26 , are used in a variety of applications , including naval vessels , fixed-wing aircraft , helicopters , and armored fighting vehicles in warfare , they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies : the imager itself is nearly impossible to detect for the enemy , as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target , as with radar or sonar the term '' forward-looking '' is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems , also known as '' push broom '' imagers , and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems , handheld imaging systems and the like in 2001 , the united states supreme court decided that performing surveillance of private property ( ostensibly to detect high emission grow lights used in clandestine cannabis farming ) using thermal imaging cameras without a search warrant by law enforcement violates the fourth amendment 's protection from unreasonable searches and seizures ctvnews.ca : '' funeral for 3 fallen rcmp officers to be held tuesday in moncton '' 7 jun 2014 during 2015 baltimore protests , the fbi conducted 10 aerial surveillance missions between april 29 and may 3 , which included '' infrared and day color , full-motion flir video evidence '' collection , according to fbi spokesman christopher allen infra-red search and track electro-optical targeting system night vision automotive night vision thermographic camera general : surveillance

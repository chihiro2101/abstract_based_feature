long-wave infrared ( lwir ) cameras , sometimes called '' far-infrared '' , operate at 8 to 12 & nbsp ; μm and can see heat sources , such as hot engine parts or human body heat , several kilometers away some long-wave cameras require their detector to be cryogenics cooled , typically for several minutes before use , although some moderately sensitive infrared cameras do not require this many thermal imagers , including some forward-looking infrared cameras ( such as some lwir synthetic vision system ( evs ) ) are also uncooled medium-wave ( mwir ) cameras operate in the 3–5 & nbsp ; μm range infrared imaging sensor arrays often have wildly inconsistent sensitivities from pixel to pixel , due to limitations in the manufacturing process thermal imaging cameras , such as the raytheon an/aaq-26 , are used in a variety of applications , including naval vessels , fixed-wing aircraft , helicopters , and armored fighting vehicles it sees radiation in the infrared spectrum , which is difficult to camouflage the cost of thermal imaging equipment in general has fallen dramatically after inexpensive portable and fixed infrared detectors and systems based on microelectromechanical systems were designed and manufactured for commercial , industrial and military application more modern cameras no longer use this method ; the simplification helps reduce cost infra-red search and track electro-optical targeting system night vision automotive night vision thermographic camera general : surveillance

the first telescopes appeared in the netherlands in 1608 when middelburg spectacle-maker hans lippershey tried to obtain a patent on one see telescope400 and the three galileos but his was the first systematic ( and published ) study of celestial bodies using one coyne , the three galileos : the man , the spacecraft , the telescope , astrophysics and space science library book series ( assl , volume 220 ) , pages 1-6 one of galileo 's first telescopes had 8x to 10x linear magnification and was made out of lenses that he had ground himself this was increased to 20x linear magnification in the improved telescope he used to make the observations in sidereus nuncius sidereus nuncius contains more than seventy drawings and diagrams of the moon , certain constellations such as orion , the pleiades , and taurus , and the galilean moons of jupiter galileo reported that he saw at least ten times more stars through the telescope than are visible to the naked eye , and he published star charts of the belt of orion and the star cluster pleiades showing some of the newly observed stars in sidereus nuncius , galileo revised and reproduced these two star groups by distinguishing between the stars seen without the telescope and those seen with it also , when he observed some of the '' nebulous '' stars in the ptolemy star catalogue , he saw that rather than being cloudy , they were made of many small stars from this he deduced that the nebulae and the milky way were '' congeries of innumerable stars grouped together in clusters '' too small and distant to be resolved into individual stars by the naked eye in the last part of sidereus nuncius , galileo reported his discovery of four objects that appeared to form a straight line of stars near jupiter throughout the text , galileo gave illustrations of the relative positions of jupiter and its apparent companion stars as they appeared nightly from late january through early march 1610 many poems and texts were published expressing love for the new form of astronomy science three works of art were even created in response to galileo 's book : adam elsheimer 's the flight into egypt ( 1610 ) , cigoli 's assumption of the virgin ( 1612 ) , and andrea sacchi 's divine wisdom ( 1631 ) marius , a german astronomer who had studied with tycho brahe , was the first to publish a book of his observations marius attacked galileo in mundus jovialis ( published in 1614 ) by insisting that he had found jupiter 's four moons before galileo and had been observing them since 1609 therefore , the night galileo first observed jupiter 's moons was january 7 , 1610 on the gregorian calendar—december 28 , 1609 on the julian calendar ( marius claimed to have first observed jupiter 's moons on december 29 , 1609 ) galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius or sidereal message telescopes , tides , and tactics : a galilean dialogue about the starry messenger and systems of the world , including translation of galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius discoveries and opinions of galileo , includes translation of galileo 's sidereus nuncius

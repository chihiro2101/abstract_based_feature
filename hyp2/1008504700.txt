see telescope400 and the three galileos but his was the first systematic ( and published ) study of celestial bodies using one coyne , the three galileos : the man , the spacecraft , the telescope , astrophysics and space science library book series ( assl , volume 220 ) , pages 1-6 one of galileo 's first telescopes had 8x to 10x linear magnification and was made out of lenses that he had ground himself this was increased to 20x linear magnification in the improved telescope he used to make the observations in sidereus nuncius sidereus nuncius contains more than seventy drawings and diagrams of the moon , certain constellations such as orion , the pleiades , and taurus , and the galilean moons of jupiter in observing the moon , galileo saw that the line separating lunar day from night ( the terminator ) was smooth where it crossed the darker regions of the moon but quite irregular where it crossed the brighter areas galileo reported that he saw at least ten times more stars through the telescope than are visible to the naked eye , and he published star charts of the belt of orion and the star cluster pleiades showing some of the newly observed stars with the naked eye observers could see only six stars in the taurus cluster ; through his telescope , however , galileo was capable of seeing thirty-five – almost six times as many in sidereus nuncius , galileo revised and reproduced these two star groups by distinguishing between the stars seen without the telescope and those seen with it from this he deduced that the nebulae and the milky way were '' congeries of innumerable stars grouped together in clusters '' too small and distant to be resolved into individual stars by the naked eye in the last part of sidereus nuncius , galileo reported his discovery of four objects that appeared to form a straight line of stars near jupiter on the first night he detected a line of three little stars close to jupiter parallel to the ecliptic ; the following nights brought different arrangements and another star into his view , totalling four stars around jupiter at the time of sidereus nuncius publication , galileo was a mathematician at the university of padua and had recently received a lifetime contract for his work in building more powerful telescopes he desired to return to florence , and in hopes of gaining patronage there , he dedicated sidereus nuncius to his former pupil , now the grand duke of tuscany , cosimo ii de ' medici in addition , he named his discovered four moons of jupiter the '' medicean stars , '' in honor of the four royal medici brothers marius attacked galileo in mundus jovialis ( published in 1614 ) by insisting that he had found jupiter 's four moons before galileo and had been observing them since 1609 but galileo was not confounded ; he pointed out that being outside the church , marius had not yet accepted the gregorian calendar and was still using the julian calendar galileo galilei , sidereus nuncius , or the sidereal messenger telescopes , tides , and tactics : a galilean dialogue about the starry messenger and systems of the world , including translation of galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius discoveries and opinions of galileo , includes translation of galileo 's sidereus nuncius

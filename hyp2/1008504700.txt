see telescope400 and the three galileos but his was the first systematic ( and published ) study of celestial bodies using one coyne , the three galileos : the man , the spacecraft , the telescope , astrophysics and space science library book series ( assl , volume 220 ) , pages 1-6 one of galileo 's first telescopes had 8x to 10x linear magnification and was made out of lenses that he had ground himself the telescope in the making , the galileo first telescopic observations , 2010 this was increased to 20x linear magnification in the improved telescope he used to make the observations in sidereus nuncius sidereus nuncius contains more than seventy drawings and diagrams of the moon , certain constellations such as orion , the pleiades , and taurus , and the galilean moons of jupiter galileo 's text also includes descriptions , explanations , and theory of his observations in observing the moon , galileo saw that the line separating lunar day from night ( the terminator ) was smooth where it crossed the darker regions of the moon but quite irregular where it crossed the brighter areas galileo 's engravings of the lunar surface provided a new form of visual representation , besides shaping the field of selenography , the study of physical features on the moon galileo reported that he saw at least ten times more stars through the telescope than are visible to the naked eye , and he published star charts of the belt of orion and the star cluster pleiades showing some of the newly observed stars in sidereus nuncius , galileo revised and reproduced these two star groups by distinguishing between the stars seen without the telescope and those seen with it also , when he observed some of the '' nebulous '' stars in the ptolemy star catalogue , he saw that rather than being cloudy , they were made of many small stars in the last part of sidereus nuncius , galileo reported his discovery of four objects that appeared to form a straight line of stars near jupiter that they changed their positions relative to jupiter from night to night and yet always appeared in the same straight line near it , persuaded galileo that they were orbiting jupiter these observations also established that there are not only three , but four , erratic sidereal bodies performing their revolutions round jupiter.the revolutions are so swift that an observer may generally get differences of position every hour in his drawings , galileo used an open circle to represent jupiter and asterisks to represent the four stars at the time of sidereus nuncius publication , galileo was a mathematician at the university of padua and had recently received a lifetime contract for his work in building more powerful telescopes '' the first astronomer to publicly support galileo 's findings was johannes kepler , who published an open letter in april 1610 , enthusiastically endorsing galileo 's credibility galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius or sidereal message telescopes , tides , and tactics : a galilean dialogue about the starry messenger and systems of the world , including translation of galileo ’ s sidereus nuncius

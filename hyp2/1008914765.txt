the scottish terrier is a small , compact , short-legged , sturdily-built terrier of good bone and substance the scottish terrier typically has a hard , wiry outer coat with a soft , dense undercoat scotties with wheaten ( straw to nearly white ) coats sometimes occur , and are similar in appearance to the soft-coated wheaten terrier or west highland white terrier scotties are territorial , alert , quick moving and feisty , perhaps even more so than other terrier breeds the '' diehard '' nickname was originally given to it in the 19th century by george , the fourth earl of dumbarton the earl had a famous pack of scottish terriers , so brave that they were named “ diehards ” they are sometimes described as an aloof breed , although it has been noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people it has been suggested that the scottish terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers , although this is not always the case there are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed , but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange . cancer in scottish terriers other cancers that are known to commonly affect scotties include mast cell tumor and hemangiosarcoma research has suggested that scottish terriers are 20 times more likely to get bladder cancer than other breeds and the most common kind of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder ( tcc ) the front legs are pushed out to the side , the back arches and the rear legs overflex , causing the dog to fall should it be moving at speed scotty cramp is found in other breeds of terrier , including the cesky terrier this condition has also been seen in other breeds of dog , such as the west highland white terrier , cairn terrier , boston terrier , as well as some larger breeds such as bullmastiffs thumb initial grouping of several of the highland terriers ( including the scottie ) under the generic name skye terriers caused some confusion in the breed 's lineage it is certain , however , that scotties and west highland white terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the blackmount region of perthshire and the moor of rannoch the first written records about a dog of similar description to the scottish terrier dates from 1436 , when don leslie described them in his book the history of scotland 1436–1561 two hundred years later , sir joshua reynolds painted a portrait of a young girl caressing a dog similar in appearance to the modern-day scottie many dog writers after the early 19th century seem to agree that there were two varieties of terrier existing in britain at the time—a rough-haired so-called scotch terrier and a smooth-haired english terrier thomas brown , in his biological sketches and authentic anecdotes of dogs ( 1829 ) , states that '' the scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the ( smooth ) english seems to have been produced by a cross from him '' image : scottish terrier sire.jpg thumb left alt '' a greyscale photograph of a typical black scottish terrier facing off camera in profile to the lower left '' ch they continued to be exhibited in generic groups for several years and these groups included the ancestors of today 's scottish terrier the exhibition and judging of dogs required comparison to a breed standard and thus the appearance and temperament of the scottie was written down for the first time eventually , the skye terriers were further divided into what are known today as the scottish terrier , skye terrier , west highland white terrier and cairn terrier in her book , the new scottish terrier , cindy cooke refers to splinter ii as the '' foundation matron of the modern scottish terrier rambler , her son by bonaccord , sired the two founding sires of the breed , ch the standard described the breed 's colouring as '' grey , grizzle or brindle '' , as the typically black colouring of scotties did not become fashionable or favoured until the 20th century the scottish terrier club of america ( stca ) was formed in 1900 and a standard written in 1925 a scottish terrier named dulcinea is a scene-stealer in the 1998 latin american novel yo-yo boing ! by giannina braschi

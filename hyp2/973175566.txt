historically , cymbals were made from individually cast cymbal blanks which were then hot-forged , often with many annealing processes , to form the rough shape of the cymbal this allows the hot forging step to be reduced or even omitted , as the resulting casting can be made far closer to the final shape of the cymbal , including its bell and taper it is an expensive process used for a few top quality bell metal cymbals the historical and current production 602 line cymbals and the historical sound creation cymbals , both from the major manufacturer paiste , and the current production m-series cymbals from meinl are made from sheet bell bronze with a 20 % tin content nevertheless , the term '' sheet metal cymbals '' tends to refer to cymbals produced from all other common cymbal alloys as opposed to bell bronze some claim that these '' sheet '' cymbals have a different sound to traditionally made cymbals , owing to their manufacture from sheet metal rather than from individual castings top quality '' cast '' cymbals are normally made from bell bronze , while '' sheet '' cymbals are normally made from malleable alloys their sound alloy patent implies that they have a method for making sheet metal cymbals of this alloy , which would make these a unique third category the 2002 paiste cymbal guide even claims that all cymbals are '' cast '' , not just their own , but here they are not using the word in the established sense all other manufacturers openly state that all of their malleable alloy cymbals are made from sheet metal , and that all of their bell bronze cymbals are individually cast one possible reason for paiste 's claims is that there is still a great deal of prestige associated with traditionally cast cymbals some top drummers who play zildjian or sabian cymbals now choose to play their sheet bronze cymbals , rather than their more expensive cast cymbals , for the sake of their sound some manufacturers of bell bronze cymbals now use hot-rolling and cold-pressing of individual cymbal blanks rather than traditional forging some hand hammered cymbals are hammered using a hammer held in the cymbal maker 's hand in general , truly hand hammered cymbals tend to have darker , lower , richer tones , and there tends to be far more variation in character between cymbals of supposedly identical models

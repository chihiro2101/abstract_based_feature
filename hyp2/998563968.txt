el escorial is situated at the foot of mt this austere location , hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace , was chosen by king philip ii of spain , and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 spanish victory at the battle of st in addition , philip envisioned el escorial as a center for studies in aid of the counter-reformation cause the design and construction were overseen by juan bautista de toledo , who did not live to see the completion of the project with toledo 's death in 1567 , direction passed to his apprentice , juan de herrera , under whom the building was completed in 1584 , in less than 21 years to this day , la obra de el escorial ( '' the work of el escorial '' ) is a proverbial expression for a thing that takes a long time to finish la obra de el escorial in the diccionario de la real academia española , 23rd edition , 2014 image : escorial traza def.jpg thumb left el escorial : floor plan , based on the floorplan of solomon 's temple since then , el escorial has been the burial site for most of the spanish kings of the last five centuries , bourbons as well as habsburgs two bourbon kings , philip v ( who reigned from 1700 to 1724 ) and ferdinand vi ( 1746–1759 ) , as well as king amadeus ( 1870–1873 ) , are not buried in the monastery the grill-like shape , which did not fully emerge until herrera eliminated from the original conception the six interior towers of the facade , was , by no means , unique to el escorial other buildings had been constructed with interior courtyards fronting on churches or chapels ; king 's college , cambridge , dating from 1441 , is one such example ; the old ospedale maggiore , milan 's first hospital , begun in 1456 by antonio filarete , is another grid-like building with interior courtyards strikingly similar to el escorial is the layout of the alcázar of seville and the design of the alhambra at granada where , as at el escorial , two courtyards in succession separate the main portal of the complex from a fully enclosed place of worship statues of david and solomon on either side of the entrance to the basilica of el escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design a more personal connection can be drawn between the david-warrior figure , representing charles v , and his son , the stolid and solomonically prudent philip ii echoing the same theme , a fresco in the center of el escorial 's library , a reminder of solomon ’ s legendary wisdom , affirms philip 's preoccupation with the great jewish king , his thoughtful and logical character , and his extraordinary monumental temple beyond being a monastery , el escorial is also a pantheon , a basilica , a convent , a school , a library , and a royal palace built primarily from locally quarried gray granite , square and sparsely ornamented , el escorial is austere , even forbidding , in its outward appearance , seemingly more like a fortress than a monastery or palace philip 's instructions to toledo were simple and clear , directing that the architects should produce '' simplicity in the construction , severity in the whole , nobility without arrogance , majesty without ostentation the library contains thousands of priceless manuscripts ; for example , the collection of the sultan , zidan abu maali , who ruled morocco from 1603 to 1627 , is housed at el escorial this has three doors : the middle one leads to the courtyard of the kings ( patio de los reyes ) and the side ones lead to a school and the other to a monastery the large chapel is one of the highlights in the basilica , presided by steps of red marble it is an octagonal baroque mausoleum made of marble where all of the spanish monarchs since charles i have been buried , with the exception of philip v , ferdinand vi , and amadeus of savoy the remains of juan de borbon , father of king juan carlos i of spain , also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that he never became king himself also find the pantheon of the princes , where the bodies of the queens who did not have a crowned succession and the princes and princesses were laid to rest this is a gardened patio in whose center rises a magnificent pavilion by juan de herrera in which one can find sculptures of the evangelists next is the palace of the austrians ( palacio de los austrias ) , also known as the house of the king ( casa del rey ) , which is found behind the presbytery of the basilica left the basilica of san lorenzo el real , the central building in the el escorial complex , was originally designed , like most of the late gothic cathedrals of western europe , to take the form of a latin cross the latin cross , with its long descending arm , is the form most familiar to western christians as the cross on which christ was supposed to have been crucified as such , it has a long nave on the west-east axis intersected by a pair of shorter transepts , one to the north and one directly opposite , to the south , about three-quarters of the way between the west entrance and the high altar this plan was modified by juan de herrera to that of a greek cross , a form with all four arms of equal length peter 's basilica in rome influenced the design of the dome of san lorenzo el real at el escorial to either side are gilded life-size bronzes of the kneeling family groups of charles and philip , also by leoni with help from his son pompeo in a shallow niche at the center of the lowest level is the tabernacle , a repository for the physical elements of the communion ceremony , a so-called '' house of the sacrament '' , designed by juan de herrera in jasper and bronze michelangelo died in 1564 , scarcely a year after the first stones at el escorial were laid , and titian , when asked to come to spain , respectfully refused on the basis of his advanced age palace of philip ii the sepulchres also contain the remains of royal consorts who were parents of monarchs the interment of the remains of queen victoria eugenie and the count and countess of barcelona in the royal pantheon will each constitute an exception to tradition first , victoria eugenie , although the wife of a king , was never the mother of a king in the strict sense secondly , the count of barcelona never reigned as king , although he was head of the spanish royal family between the renunciation of his father 's rights on 14 january 1941 and his renunciation of his own rights in favour of his son , juan carlos i on 14 may 1977 constructed at the order of philip ii , a great lover of nature , these constitute an ideal place for repose and meditation it was planned by juan de herrera , who shared the king 's neoplatonic views and also designed the library ’ s shelves ;

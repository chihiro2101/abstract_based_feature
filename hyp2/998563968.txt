el escorial is situated at the foot of mt this austere location , hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace , was chosen by king philip ii of spain , and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 spanish victory at the battle of st quentin in picardy against henry ii , king of france he also intended the complex to serve as a necropolis for the interment of the remains of his parents , charles i and isabella of portugal , himself , and his descendants in addition , philip envisioned el escorial as a center for studies in aid of the counter-reformation cause the design and construction were overseen by juan bautista de toledo , who did not live to see the completion of the project with toledo 's death in 1567 , direction passed to his apprentice , juan de herrera , under whom the building was completed in 1584 , in less than 21 years to this day , la obra de el escorial ( '' the work of el escorial '' ) is a proverbial expression for a thing that takes a long time to finish la obra de el escorial in the diccionario de la real academia española , 23rd edition , 2014 image : escorial traza def.jpg thumb left el escorial : floor plan , based on the floorplan of solomon 's temple since then , el escorial has been the burial site for most of the spanish kings of the last five centuries , bourbons as well as habsburgs two bourbon kings , philip v ( who reigned from 1700 to 1724 ) and ferdinand vi ( 1746–1759 ) , as well as king amadeus ( 1870–1873 ) , are not buried in the monastery statues of david and solomon on either side of the entrance to the basilica of el escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design consideraciones sobre la idea de el escorial , ediciones siruela , madrid , enhanced from monograph in rudolph wittkower 's 1968 festschrift beyond being a monastery , el escorial is also a pantheon , a basilica , a convent , a school , a library , and a royal palace philip 's instructions to toledo were simple and clear , directing that the architects should produce '' simplicity in the construction , severity in the whole , nobility without arrogance , majesty without ostentation it displays masterworks by titian , tintoretto , benvenuto cellini , el greco , velázquez , rogier van der weyden , paolo veronese , alonzo cano , josé de ribera , claudio coello and others the library contains thousands of priceless manuscripts ; for example , the collection of the sultan , zidan abu maali , who ruled morocco from 1603 to 1627 , is housed at el escorial in order to describe the parts of the great building in a coherent fashion , it may be useful to undertake an imaginary walking tour , beginning with the main entrance at the center of the western facade : the first thing one finds upon arriving to el escorial is the main façade this has three doors : the middle one leads to the courtyard of the kings ( patio de los reyes ) and the side ones lead to a school and the other to a monastery its main altarpiece is 30 meters high and divided in compartments of different sizes where are find bronze sculptures and canvas authored by tibaldi , zuccari or leoni in the capitulary and the sacristy rooms , painting such as joseph 's coat by velázquez , the last supper by titian , or the adoration of the sacred host by charles ii by claudio coello are on exhibit it is an octagonal baroque mausoleum made of marble where all of the spanish monarchs since charles i have been buried , with the exception of philip v , ferdinand vi , and amadeus of savoy the remains of juan de borbon , father of king juan carlos i of spain , also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that he never became king himself around the courtyard are the galleries of the main cloister , decorated with frescoes by pellegrino tibaldi and his workshop , in which scenes from the history of the redemption are represented in the east gallery , one finds the splendid main staircase with a fresco-decorated vaulted ceiling depicting the glory of the spanish monarchy painted by luca giordano in 1692 next is the palace of the austrians ( palacio de los austrias ) , also known as the house of the king ( casa del rey ) , which is found behind the presbytery of the basilica left the basilica of san lorenzo el real , the central building in the el escorial complex , was originally designed , like most of the late gothic cathedrals of western europe , to take the form of a latin cross peter 's basilica in rome influenced the design of the dome of san lorenzo el real at el escorial peter 's as the quintessential expression of baroque sensuality and the basilica at el escorial as a statement of the stark rigidity and grim purposefulness of the inquisition , the two sides of the counter-reformation in a shallow niche at the center of the lowest level is the tabernacle , a repository for the physical elements of the communion ceremony , a so-called '' house of the sacrament '' , designed by juan de herrera in jasper and bronze michelangelo died in 1564 , scarcely a year after the first stones at el escorial were laid , and titian , when asked to come to spain , respectfully refused on the basis of his advanced age consequently , philip consulted his foreign ambassadors for recommendations , and the result was a lengthy parade of the lesser european artists of that time , all swanning through the construction site at el escorial seeking the king 's favor situated next to the main altar of the basilica , the residence of king philip ii is made up of a series of austerely decorated rooms the sepulchres also contain the remains of royal consorts who were parents of monarchs the remains of alphonse xiii 's third son juan , count of barcelona and daughter-in-law maria de las mercedes ( the father and mother of the former king juan carlos i ) , lie at a prepared place called a pudridero , or decaying chamber , awaiting interment in the pantheon of the kings the interment of the remains of queen victoria eugenie and the count and countess of barcelona in the royal pantheon will each constitute an exception to tradition however , some consider the count of barcelona to have been de jure king of spain from 1941 - 1977 , which in turn would make him , his mother , queen victoria eugenie and his wife , the countess of barcelona eligible for interment in the pantheon of kings upon his death in october 2015 , his funeral was held at el escorial and his body placed in the pudridero , awaiting future interment in the pantheon at this point , the size of the library was such that benito arias montano had to be specially hired to organize the books and classify them by language in addition to subject , perfil histórico de la real biblioteca de el escorial , en santiago paéz , e before his death , philip ii left in his last will a pension for the escorial library to ensure that it would still be able to acquire new volumes juan de herrera also designed the casas de oficios ( official buildings ) opposite the monastery 's north façade ; and his successor , francisco de mora , designed the casa de la compaña ( company quarters )

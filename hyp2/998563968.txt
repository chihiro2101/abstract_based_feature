el escorial is situated at the foot of mt this austere location , hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace , was chosen by king philip ii of spain , and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 spanish victory at the battle of st he also intended the complex to serve as a necropolis for the interment of the remains of his parents , charles i and isabella of portugal , himself , and his descendants in addition , philip envisioned el escorial as a center for studies in aid of the counter-reformation cause with toledo 's death in 1567 , direction passed to his apprentice , juan de herrera , under whom the building was completed in 1584 , in less than 21 years to this day , la obra de el escorial ( '' the work of el escorial '' ) is a proverbial expression for a thing that takes a long time to finish la obra de el escorial in the diccionario de la real academia española , 23rd edition , 2014 image : escorial traza def.jpg thumb left el escorial : floor plan , based on the floorplan of solomon 's temple since then , el escorial has been the burial site for most of the spanish kings of the last five centuries , bourbons as well as habsburgs two bourbon kings , philip v ( who reigned from 1700 to 1724 ) and ferdinand vi ( 1746–1759 ) , as well as king amadeus ( 1870–1873 ) , are not buried in the monastery the grill-like shape , which did not fully emerge until herrera eliminated from the original conception the six interior towers of the facade , was , by no means , unique to el escorial in fact , palaces of this approximate design were commonplace in the byzantine and arab world strikingly similar to el escorial is the layout of the alcázar of seville and the design of the alhambra at granada where , as at el escorial , two courtyards in succession separate the main portal of the complex from a fully enclosed place of worship statues of david and solomon on either side of the entrance to the basilica of el escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design echoing the same theme , a fresco in the center of el escorial 's library , a reminder of solomon ’ s legendary wisdom , affirms philip 's preoccupation with the great jewish king , his thoughtful and logical character , and his extraordinary monumental temple consideraciones sobre la idea de el escorial , ediciones siruela , madrid , enhanced from monograph in rudolph wittkower 's 1968 festschrift beyond being a monastery , el escorial is also a pantheon , a basilica , a convent , a school , a library , and a royal palace at each of the four corners is a square tower surmounted by a spire , and , near the center of the complex ( and taller than the rest ) rise the pointed belfries and round dome of the basilica philip 's instructions to toledo were simple and clear , directing that the architects should produce '' simplicity in the construction , severity in the whole , nobility without arrogance , majesty without ostentation '' aside from its explicit purposes , the complex is also an enormous storehouse of art it displays masterworks by titian , tintoretto , benvenuto cellini , el greco , velázquez , rogier van der weyden , paolo veronese , alonzo cano , josé de ribera , claudio coello and others the library contains thousands of priceless manuscripts ; for example , the collection of the sultan , zidan abu maali , who ruled morocco from 1603 to 1627 , is housed at el escorial this has three doors : the middle one leads to the courtyard of the kings ( patio de los reyes ) and the side ones lead to a school and the other to a monastery the courtyard is an enclosure that owes its name to the statues of the kings of judah that adorn the façade of the basílica , located at the back , from which one can access from the courtyard it is an octagonal baroque mausoleum made of marble where all of the spanish monarchs since charles i have been buried , with the exception of philip v , ferdinand vi , and amadeus of savoy the remains of juan de borbon , father of king juan carlos i of spain , also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that he never became king himself also find the pantheon of the princes , where the bodies of the queens who did not have a crowned succession and the princes and princesses were laid to rest in the east gallery , one finds the splendid main staircase with a fresco-decorated vaulted ceiling depicting the glory of the spanish monarchy painted by luca giordano in 1692 the outbuildings of this palace are distributed around the courtyard of the fountainheads ( patio de los mascarones ) , of italian style the latin cross , with its long descending arm , is the form most familiar to western christians as the cross on which christ was supposed to have been crucified this plan was modified by juan de herrera to that of a greek cross , a form with all four arms of equal length peter 's basilica in rome influenced the design of the dome of san lorenzo el real at el escorial peter 's as the quintessential expression of baroque sensuality and the basilica at el escorial as a statement of the stark rigidity and grim purposefulness of the inquisition , the two sides of the counter-reformation the most highly decorated part of the church is the area surrounding the high altar to either side are gilded life-size bronzes of the kneeling family groups of charles and philip , also by leoni with help from his son pompeo consequently , philip consulted his foreign ambassadors for recommendations , and the result was a lengthy parade of the lesser european artists of that time , all swanning through the construction site at el escorial seeking the king 's favor this statue of christ is unusual because it was represented fully nude ; although for modesty reasons wears one cloth covering the genitals there are two pudrideros at el escorial , one for the pantheon of the kings and the other for the pantheon of the princes manuel azaña , who studied in the monastery 's augustinian-run school , mentions them in his memorias ( memoirs ) and his play el jardín de los frailes ( the garden of the friars ) during philip ii ’ s reign , the library introduced a novel way of arranging the library 's bookcases or “ book presses ” , real biblioteca de el escorial , 1ª edición , madrid : aldus , 1970 , dl : m , la fundación del monasterio de el escorial , 1ª edición , madrid : turner libros s , perfil histórico de la real biblioteca de el escorial , en santiago paéz , e juan de herrera also designed the casas de oficios ( official buildings ) opposite the monastery 's north façade ;

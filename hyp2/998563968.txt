el escorial is situated at the foot of mt this austere location , hardly an obvious choice for the site of a royal palace , was chosen by king philip ii of spain , and it was he who ordained the building of a grand edifice here to commemorate the 1557 spanish victory at the battle of st he also intended the complex to serve as a necropolis for the interment of the remains of his parents , charles i and isabella of portugal , himself , and his descendants in addition , philip envisioned el escorial as a center for studies in aid of the counter-reformation cause the design and construction were overseen by juan bautista de toledo , who did not live to see the completion of the project with toledo 's death in 1567 , direction passed to his apprentice , juan de herrera , under whom the building was completed in 1584 , in less than 21 years to this day , la obra de el escorial ( '' the work of el escorial '' ) is a proverbial expression for a thing that takes a long time to finish la obra de el escorial in the diccionario de la real academia española , 23rd edition , 2014 image : escorial traza def.jpg thumb left el escorial : floor plan , based on the floorplan of solomon 's temple since then , el escorial has been the burial site for most of the spanish kings of the last five centuries , bourbons as well as habsburgs the royal pantheon contains the tombs of the holy roman emperor charles v ( who ruled spain as king charles i ) , philip ii , philip iii , philip iv , charles ii , louis i , charles iii , charles iv , ferdinand vii , isabella ii , alfonso xii , and alfonso xiii two bourbon kings , philip v ( who reigned from 1700 to 1724 ) and ferdinand vi ( 1746–1759 ) , as well as king amadeus ( 1870–1873 ) , are not buried in the monastery strikingly similar to el escorial is the layout of the alcázar of seville and the design of the alhambra at granada where , as at el escorial , two courtyards in succession separate the main portal of the complex from a fully enclosed place of worship nonetheless , the most persuasive theory for the origin of the floor plan is that it is based on descriptions of the temple of solomon by the judeo-roman historian , flavius josephus : a portico followed by a courtyard open to the sky , followed by a second portico and a second courtyard , all flanked by arcades and enclosed passageways , leading to the '' holy of holies '' statues of david and solomon on either side of the entrance to the basilica of el escorial lend further weight to the theory that this is the true origin of the design a more personal connection can be drawn between the david-warrior figure , representing charles v , and his son , the stolid and solomonically prudent philip ii echoing the same theme , a fresco in the center of el escorial 's library , a reminder of solomon ’ s legendary wisdom , affirms philip 's preoccupation with the great jewish king , his thoughtful and logical character , and his extraordinary monumental temple consideraciones sobre la idea de el escorial , ediciones siruela , madrid , enhanced from monograph in rudolph wittkower 's 1968 festschrift beyond being a monastery , el escorial is also a pantheon , a basilica , a convent , a school , a library , and a royal palace at each of the four corners is a square tower surmounted by a spire , and , near the center of the complex ( and taller than the rest ) rise the pointed belfries and round dome of the basilica it displays masterworks by titian , tintoretto , benvenuto cellini , el greco , velázquez , rogier van der weyden , paolo veronese , alonzo cano , josé de ribera , claudio coello and others the library contains thousands of priceless manuscripts ; for example , the collection of the sultan , zidan abu maali , who ruled morocco from 1603 to 1627 , is housed at el escorial the first thing one finds upon arriving to el escorial is the main façade the remains of juan de borbon , father of king juan carlos i of spain , also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that he never became king himself this is a gardened patio in whose center rises a magnificent pavilion by juan de herrera in which one can find sculptures of the evangelists in the east gallery , one finds the splendid main staircase with a fresco-decorated vaulted ceiling depicting the glory of the spanish monarchy painted by luca giordano in 1692 next is the palace of the austrians ( palacio de los austrias ) , also known as the house of the king ( casa del rey ) , which is found behind the presbytery of the basilica the latin cross , with its long descending arm , is the form most familiar to western christians as the cross on which christ was supposed to have been crucified as such , it has a long nave on the west-east axis intersected by a pair of shorter transepts , one to the north and one directly opposite , to the south , about three-quarters of the way between the west entrance and the high altar this plan was modified by juan de herrera to that of a greek cross , a form with all four arms of equal length peter 's basilica in rome influenced the design of the dome of san lorenzo el real at el escorial peter 's as the quintessential expression of baroque sensuality and the basilica at el escorial as a statement of the stark rigidity and grim purposefulness of the inquisition , the two sides of the counter-reformation the most highly decorated part of the church is the area surrounding the high altar behind the altar is a three-tiered reredos , or altar screen , made of red granite and jasper , nearly twenty-eight metres tall , adorned with gilded bronze statuary by leone leoni , and three sets of religious paintings commissioned by philip ii consequently , philip consulted his foreign ambassadors for recommendations , and the result was a lengthy parade of the lesser european artists of that time , all swanning through the construction site at el escorial seeking the king 's favor situated next to the main altar of the basilica , the residence of king philip ii is made up of a series of austerely decorated rooms the most recent monarch interred in the pantheon is king alphonse xiii , removed there from the church of santa maria in monserrato , rome in 1980 however , some consider the count of barcelona to have been de jure king of spain from 1941 - 1977 , which in turn would make him , his mother , queen victoria eugenie and his wife , the countess of barcelona eligible for interment in the pantheon of kings image : casita del príncipe 2.jpg thumb 220px the casita del principe , was built in 1771-75 to designs of juan de villanueva , for the prince of the asturias , the future carlos iv real monasterio-palacio de el escorial : estudios inéditos en commemoración del iv centenario de la terminación de las obras during the reign of phillip ii , there was an entire room dedicated to ancient manuscripts , most of them in latin , many in greek , but also some in hebrew , aramaic , arabic , italian , french , and spanish other valuable libraries acquired from various erudites by king philip ii were the library of pedro fajardo , and of antonio agustín , one of the largest in spain at the time before his death , philip ii left in his last will a pension for the escorial library to ensure that it would still be able to acquire new volumes juan de herrera also designed the casas de oficios ( official buildings ) opposite the monastery 's north façade ; and his successor , francisco de mora , designed the casa de la compaña ( company quarters )

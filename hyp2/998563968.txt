for example , the collection of the sultan , zidan abu maali , who ruled morocco from 1603 to 1627 , is housed at el escorial in order to describe the parts of the great building in a coherent fashion , it may be useful to undertake an imaginary walking tour , beginning with the main entrance at the center of the western facade : this has three doors : the middle one leads to the courtyard of the kings ( patio de los reyes ) and the side ones lead to a school and the other to a monastery the courtyard is an enclosure that owes its name to the statues of the kings of judah that adorn the façade of the basílica , located at the back , from which one can access from the courtyard this spectacular basilica has a floor in the shape of a greek cross and an enormous cupola inspired by st in the capitulary and the sacristy rooms , painting such as joseph 's coat by velázquez , the last supper by titian , or the adoration of the sacred host by charles ii by claudio coello are on exhibit it is an octagonal baroque mausoleum made of marble where all of the spanish monarchs since charles i have been buried , with the exception of philip v , ferdinand vi , and amadeus of savoy the remains of juan de borbon , father of king juan carlos i of spain , also rest in this pantheon despite the fact that he never became king himself this is a gardened patio in whose center rises a magnificent pavilion by juan de herrera in which one can find sculptures of the evangelists around the courtyard are the galleries of the main cloister , decorated with frescoes by pellegrino tibaldi and his workshop , in which scenes from the history of the redemption are represented in the east gallery , one finds the splendid main staircase with a fresco-decorated vaulted ceiling depicting the glory of the spanish monarchy painted by luca giordano in 1692 left the basilica of san lorenzo el real , the central building in the el escorial complex , was originally designed , like most of the late gothic cathedrals of western europe , to take the form of a latin cross this plan was modified by juan de herrera to that of a greek cross , a form with all four arms of equal length peter 's basilica in rome influenced the design of the dome of san lorenzo el real at el escorial consequently , philip consulted his foreign ambassadors for recommendations , and the result was a lengthy parade of the lesser european artists of that time , all swanning through the construction site at el escorial seeking the king 's favor this chamber consists of twenty-six marble sepulchres containing the remains of the kings and queens regnant ( the only queen regnant since philip ii being isabella ii ) , of the habsburg and bourbon dynasties from charles i to the present , except for philip v and ferdinand vi real monasterio-palacio de el escorial : estudios inéditos en commemoración del iv centenario de la terminación de las obras currently the library has more than 40,000 volumes , located in a great hall fifty-four metres in length , nine metres wide and ten metres tall with marble floors and beautifully carved wood shelves he also bought 315 original volumes from juan páez de castro 's personal library , in greek and arabic , perfil histórico de la real biblioteca de el escorial , en santiago paéz , e the king actively purchased rare books , often on esoteric , scientific or theological subjects from the east shortly after , as the habsburg dynasty came to its end and the bourbons took the throne after the war of the spanish succession , a further loss took place , as the bourbon kings reversed the trend of acquiring books for the library and instead proceeded to take books out to send to france or to their own libraries , real biblioteca de el escorial , 1ª edición , madrid : aldus , 1970 , dl : m

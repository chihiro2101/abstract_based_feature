when edward visited depressed mining villages in wales , his comment that '' something must be done '' the duke of windsor , p led to concerns among elected politicians that he would interfere in political matters , traditionally avoided by constitutional monarchs although edward 's comments had made him popular in wales , see , for example , williams , p as prince of wales , edward had publicly referred to labour county councillors as '' cranks '' the duke of windsor , p during his reign as king , his refusal to accept the advice of ministers continued : he opposed the imposition of sanctions on italy after its invasion of ethiopia , refused to receive the deposed haile selassie i , and would not support a strengthening of the league of nations members of the british government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that wallis simpson was an agent of nazi germany it was rumoured that simpson had access to confidential government papers sent to edward , which he left unguarded at his fort belvedere residence british prime minister stanley baldwin explicitly advised edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying simpson , indicating that if he did , in direct contravention of his ministers ' advice , the government would resign en masse '' the duke of windsor , p the second option had european precedents , including edward 's own great-grandfather , duke alexander of w√ºrttemberg , but it had no parallel in british constitutional history the prime ministers of the five dominions ( australia , canada , new zealand , south africa , and the irish free state ) were consulted , and the majority agreed that there was '' no alternative to course ( 3 ) '' mackenzie king told edward to do '' what he believed in his own heart was right '' and the canadian government appealed to the king to put his duty before his feelings for simpson he supposed that if the british people would not accept wallis simpson then abdication was the only possible solution in a private letter to geoffrey dawson , the editor of the times newspaper , churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because , given time , the king might fall out of love with simpson the royal physician bertrand dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease , but he eventually accepted , on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph , that baldwin 's heart was sound political support for the king was scattered and comprised politicians alienated from the mainstream parties such as churchill , oswald mosley , and the communists in early december , rumours circulated that the king 's supporters would join together in a '' king 's party '' , led by churchill nevertheless , the rumours damaged the king and churchill severely , as members of parliament were horrified at the idea of the king interfering in politics the letters and diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen generally demonstrate support for the king , while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste the times , the morning post , daily herald , and newspapers owned by lord kemsley , such as the daily telegraph , opposed the marriage on 5 december , having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry simpson , and having had his request to broadcast to the empire to explain '' his side of the story '' blocked on constitutional grounds , the duke of windsor , pp the courts could not grant a collaborative divorce ( a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties ) , and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against ernest simpson , with wallis simpson as the innocent , injured party the divorce action would fail if the citizen 's intervention showed that the simpsons had colluded by , for example , connivance or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else on 11 december 1936 , edward made a bbc radio broadcast from windsor castle ; having abdicated , he was introduced by sir john reith as '' his royal highness prince edward '' george vi granted his elder brother the title of duke of windsor with the style his royal highness on 12 december 1936 2 after the outbreak of the second world war in september 1939 , edward was assigned to the british military mission in france claims that edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and '' persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem , wrongly , to provide insufficient explanation for the king 's departure ''

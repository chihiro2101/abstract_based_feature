when edward visited depressed mining villages in wales , his comment that '' something must be done '' the duke of windsor , p led to concerns among elected politicians that he would interfere in political matters , traditionally avoided by constitutional monarchs he became extremely unpopular with the public in scotland following his refusal to open a new wing of aberdeen royal infirmary , saying he could not do so because he was in mourning for his father members of the british government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that wallis simpson was an agent of nazi germany the foreign office obtained leaked dispatches from the german reich 's ambassador to the united kingdom , joachim von ribbentrop , which revealed his strong view that opposition to the marriage was motivated by the wish '' to defeat those germanophile forces which had been working through mrs simpson '' it was rumoured that simpson had access to confidential government papers sent to edward , which he left unguarded at his fort belvedere residence while edward was abdicating , the personal protection officers guarding simpson in exile in france sent reports to downing street suggesting that she might '' flit to germany '' as a result of these rumours and arguments , the belief strengthened among the british establishment that simpson could not become a royal consort the second option had european precedents , including edward 's own great-grandfather , duke alexander of württemberg , but it had no parallel in british constitutional history mackenzie king told edward to do '' what he believed in his own heart was right '' and the canadian government appealed to the king to put his duty before his feelings for simpson in communications with the british government , éamon de valera ( president of the executive council of the irish free state ) remarked that as a roman catholic country , the irish free state did not recognise divorce he supposed that if the british people would not accept wallis simpson then abdication was the only possible solution on 24 november , baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in britain : leader of the opposition clement attlee , liberal leader sir archibald sinclair , and winston churchill in july , he had advised the king 's legal counsel , walter monckton , against the divorce , but his advice was ignored in a private letter to geoffrey dawson , the editor of the times newspaper , churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because , given time , the king might fall out of love with simpson the letters and diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen generally demonstrate support for the king , while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste on the other hand , the express and mail , owned by lord beaverbrook and lord rothermere , respectively , appeared to support a morganatic marriage on 3 december , edward had a '' tense '' meeting with baldwin backed by churchill and beaverbrook , edward proposed to broadcast a speech via the bbc edward proposed to remind his listeners : '' i am still the same man whose motto was 'ich dien ' , i serve edward 's british ministers felt that , in proposing the speech , edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the crown the courts could not grant a collaborative divorce ( a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties ) , and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against ernest simpson , with wallis simpson as the innocent , injured party it was , however , too late ; the king had already made up his mind to go , even if he could not marry simpson this was duly given by the parliament of australia , which was at the time in session , and by the governments of canada , south africa , and new zealand , whose parliaments were in recess edward 's reign had lasted 327 & nbsp ; days , the shortest of any british monarch since the disputed reign of lady jane grey over 380 & nbsp ; years earlier 2 after the outbreak of the second world war in september 1939 , edward was assigned to the british military mission in france documents on german foreign policy 1918–1945 series d , volume viii , quoted in bradford , p

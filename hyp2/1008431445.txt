when edward visited depressed mining villages in wales , his comment that '' something must be done '' the duke of windsor , p although edward 's comments had made him popular in wales , see , for example , williams , p during his reign as king , his refusal to accept the advice of ministers continued : he opposed the imposition of sanctions on italy after its invasion of ethiopia , refused to receive the deposed haile selassie i , and would not support a strengthening of the league of nations members of the british government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that wallis simpson was an agent of nazi germany '' the duke of windsor , p the second option had european precedents , including edward 's own great-grandfather , duke alexander of w√ºrttemberg , but it had no parallel in british constitutional history the prime ministers of the five dominions ( australia , canada , new zealand , south africa , and the irish free state ) were consulted , and the majority agreed that there was '' no alternative to course ( 3 ) '' mackenzie king told edward to do '' what he believed in his own heart was right '' and the canadian government appealed to the king to put his duty before his feelings for simpson if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable '' , but '' would be guided by the decision of the home government '' he supposed that if the british people would not accept wallis simpson then abdication was the only possible solution supporters of the king alleged a conspiracy between baldwin , geoffrey dawson , and cosmo gordon lang , the archbishop of canterbury the royal physician bertrand dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease , but he eventually accepted , on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph , that baldwin 's heart was sound political support for the king was scattered and comprised politicians alienated from the mainstream parties such as churchill , oswald mosley , and the communists former prime minister david lloyd george also supported the king despite disliking simpson in early december , rumours circulated that the king 's supporters would join together in a '' king 's party '' , led by churchill nevertheless , the rumours damaged the king and churchill severely , as members of parliament were horrified at the idea of the king interfering in politics backed by churchill and beaverbrook , edward proposed to broadcast a speech via the bbc the proposed text invoked the '' ancient custom '' for a king to '' address his public utterances to his people '' '' in the proposed speech , edward indicated his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate , while marrying simpson morganatically in one section , edward proposed to say : baldwin blocked the speech , saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles simpson refused , but they both telephoned the king to inform him that she was willing to give him up so that he could remain king though the british government , hoping for expediency and to avoid embarrassment , wished the dominions to accept the actions of the '' home '' government , the dominions held that edward 's abdication required the consent of each commonwealth state edward 's supporters felt that he had '' been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug baldwin '' , david lloyd george quoted in williams , p on 11 december 1936 , edward made a bbc radio broadcast from windsor castle ; having abdicated , he was introduced by sir john reith as '' his royal highness prince edward '' the times printed a single sentence below a separate , and seemingly unconnected , report announcing the duke 's departure from austria she became the duchess of windsor , but , much to edward 's disgust , george vi issued letters patent that denied her the style of her royal highness in october 1937 , the duke and duchess visited germany , against the advice of the british government , and met hitler at his obersalzberg retreat

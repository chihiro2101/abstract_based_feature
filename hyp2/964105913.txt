lüneburg heath is a sub-division of the north european plain in the list of the major natural regions of germany issued by the federal office for nature conservation ( bundesamt für naturschutz ) it is region number d28 lüneburg heath covers an area which includes the districts ( landkreise ) of celle , gifhorn , heidekreis , uelzen , lüneburg , lüchow-dannenberg , southeast rotenburg ( the town of visselhövede , fintel , part of the municipality of scheeßel and the eastern half of bothel ) and the landkreis harburg the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest on the northwestern edge of lüneburg heath are the harburg hills and south of schneverdingen there are bogs , such as the pietzmoor also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) the eastern boundary to the wendland is formed by the göhrde-drawehn hills ( the ostheide natural region ) parts of lüneburg heath are in the südheide nature park , others in the lüneburg heath nature park image : wilseder berg 005.jpg left thumb wilseder berg the highest elevation on lüneburg heath is the wilseder berg above nn ) rivers in the area , beside the numerous small heathland streams , include the wümme , which rises on the western slopes of the wilseder berg , in the south the lachte with its tributary the lutter , and the aller , the vissel , the böhme , the grindau , the meiße and the örtze the landscape consists of flat plains of ground moraines , ridges of hilly terminal moraines and also of sandar - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet during the saalian stage ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) the area of the present-day lüneburg heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet in the last glacial period ( 110,000–10,000 years ago ) the ice sheet no longer covered the lüneburg heath area ; it reached only as far as the river elbe due to the lack of vegetation , the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water , wind and by soil fluction ; this resulted in valleys like the totengrund the material displaced by erosion , referred to as sediment ( geschiebedecksand ) , has a depth of 0.4 to 0.8 metres ( on slopes up to 1.5 metres ) in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine unlike the other natural divisions of lüneburg heath , the terrain is quite rugged they are part of the lüneburg heath nature park and of great importance for tourism south heath : the south heath ( südheide ) is dominated by expanses of gently undulating , hilly sander plains , and sheets of ground moraine and the remains of end moraines from earlier ice ages there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however a large area of the südheide is covered by pine forests there are still large areas of heath here as well , for example the ellerndorfer heide ( '' ellerndorf heath '' ) in western uelzen district or the klein bünstorfer heide ( '' klein bünstorf heath '' ) the heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the elbe ; rivers such as the seeve , aue , luhe ( ilmenau ) there is hardly any heathland left in this area , it has been largely reforested by pines bfn lower saxony landscape profile phenologcal natural region map thumb lüneburg heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the atlantic , with mild winters , cool summers and precipitation all-year round thumb in the northwestern part of lüneburg heath is the lüneburg heath nature park which covers an area of at its heart , around the wilseder berg , is the lüneburg heath nature reserve ( naturschutzgebiet or nsg ) founded as long ago as 1921 with of land which is roughly 58 % woods and 20 % heathland other nature parks in the lüneburg heath region are the südheide nature park and elbufer-drawehn nature park right in the north of the area is the harburg hills nature park by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed 721 image : steingrund 009.jpg thumb herd of heidschnucken ( moorland sheep ) not until after 1000 ad does the pollen analysis show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in calluna the typical heath farming economy emerged : due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields , from which grain , in particular , could be produced as heather decomposes , the ph value of the soil falls drastically , as far as the iron buffer-region at ph 3 , which initiates the process of podsolisation soil life is severely damaged , which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the root zone on the heath at a depth of about the oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the middle ages as a result of the demand for wood by the lüneburg salt pans is incorrect the lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt , but they did not appear until around 1000 ad , by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years in any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath , but via the waterways , especially from mecklenburg up the elbe and from the area of the schaalsee in the 20th century , numerous conservation measures were implemented on lüneburg heath ; as a result , it is one of the best researched regions of central europe ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types ; lichen-rich sand heath ( flechtenreiche sandheide , genisto-callunetum cladonietosum ) the lichen-rich sand heaths can be told apart from the other types of heathland by the presence of various cladonia ( cladonia ) , marchantiophyta ( ptilidium ciliare ) and polytrichaceae ( polytrichum juniperinum ) this type of heath is found west of niederhaverbeck and near sundermühlen blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes , the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges this type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the wilseder berg , as well as the steingrund and totengrund wolves , although once extinct in the area , have returned to the lüneburg heath the most famous heath poet was the local writer hermann löns ( 1866–1914 ) , who spent some time living in a hunting lodge near westenholz the reich conservation law was passed in 1933 and lüneburg heath was designated as an official nature reserve lüneburg heath nature park lüneburg heath nature reserve ahlden house auf der lüneburger heide ( song ) terminal moraine list of glacial moraines

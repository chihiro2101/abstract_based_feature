lüneburg heath is a sub-division of the north european plain in the list of the major natural regions of germany issued by the federal office for nature conservation ( bundesamt für naturschutz ) it is region number d28 the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln this region has no sharply defined boundary with the lüneburg heath lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest on the northwestern edge of lüneburg heath are the harburg hills and south of schneverdingen there are bogs , such as the pietzmoor also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) the eastern boundary to the wendland is formed by the göhrde-drawehn hills ( the ostheide natural region ) parts of lüneburg heath are in the südheide nature park , others in the lüneburg heath nature park image : wilseder berg 005.jpg left thumb wilseder berg the highest elevation on lüneburg heath is the wilseder berg above nn ) several of these hills - the wilseder berg , the falkenberg , the haußelberg and the breithorn - were used by the mathematician , carl friedrich gauss , as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the kingdom of hanover from 1821–1825 the immediate subsurface layers on lüneburg heath are almost exclusively made up of deposits from the quaternary ice age in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine lüneburg heath is divided into the following natural sub-divisions : hohe heide : the hohe heide ( '' high heath '' ) consists of a series of end moraines from the glaciers of the saalian glaciation ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) with the wilseder berg at its heart unlike the other natural divisions of lüneburg heath , the terrain is quite rugged they are part of the lüneburg heath nature park and of great importance for tourism south heath : the south heath ( südheide ) is dominated by expanses of gently undulating , hilly sander plains , and sheets of ground moraine and the remains of end moraines from earlier ice ages there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however it is part of the lüneburg heath nature reserve ostheide : numerous end moraines run through the ostheide ( '' east heath '' ) which stretches on the eastern edge of lüneburg heath from lüneburg to north of wolfsburg luheheide : the ridges of end moraine on the luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the elbe valley the heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the elbe ; rivers such as the seeve , aue , luhe ( ilmenau ) settlements are crowded together in the valleys bfn lower saxony landscape profile phenologcal natural region map thumb lüneburg heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the atlantic , with mild winters , cool summers and precipitation all-year round the hohe heide , however , has a '' low mountain climate '' with lower temperatures and higher precipitation than in the surrounding area thumb in the northwestern part of lüneburg heath is the lüneburg heath nature park which covers an area of at its heart , around the wilseder berg , is the lüneburg heath nature reserve ( naturschutzgebiet or nsg ) founded as long ago as 1921 with of land which is roughly 58 % woods and 20 % heathland other nature parks in the lüneburg heath region are the südheide nature park and elbufer-drawehn nature park the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe the heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the north german plain in which the hunter culture of the mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by neolithic farmers by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed finally , after the migration period , the wooded areas of the region increased considerably 721 image : steingrund 009.jpg thumb herd of heidschnucken ( moorland sheep ) not until after 1000 ad does the pollen analysis show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in calluna the typical heath farming economy emerged : due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields , from which grain , in particular , could be produced as heather decomposes , the ph value of the soil falls drastically , as far as the iron buffer-region at ph 3 , which initiates the process of podsolisation the subsoil thus separates itself from the topsoil the nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath in the 20th century , numerous conservation measures were implemented on lüneburg heath ; as a result , it is one of the best researched regions of central europe ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types this reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air , the increase in plant litter ( rohhumusauflagen ) and the natural ageing of the heathland clay heaths have become very rare within the lüneburg heath blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes , the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges this type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the wilseder berg , as well as the steingrund and totengrund it occurs in places close to the water table and in the transition zone around bogs its primary locations are areas north of wilsede and near the hörpel ponds ( hörpeler teichen ) he worked the heath countryside into his books and promoted the foundation of the first german nature reserve on lüneburg heath the area of lüneburg heath near wilsede was selected as the location for the north german national park the memorial/exhibition at the former bergen-belsen concentration camp near the town of bergen is also located in the lüneburg heath

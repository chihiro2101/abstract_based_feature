lüneburg heath is a sub-division of the north european plain lüneburg heath covers an area which includes the districts ( landkreise ) of celle , gifhorn , heidekreis , uelzen , lüneburg , lüchow-dannenberg , southeast rotenburg ( the town of visselhövede , fintel , part of the municipality of scheeßel and the eastern half of bothel ) and the landkreis harburg the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln this region has no sharply defined boundary with the lüneburg heath lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest on the northwestern edge of lüneburg heath are the harburg hills and south of schneverdingen there are bogs , such as the pietzmoor also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) parts of lüneburg heath are in the südheide nature park , others in the lüneburg heath nature park image : wilseder berg 005.jpg left thumb wilseder berg the highest elevation on lüneburg heath is the wilseder berg above nn ) several of these hills - the wilseder berg , the falkenberg , the haußelberg and the breithorn - were used by the mathematician , carl friedrich gauss , as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the kingdom of hanover from 1821–1825 rivers in the area , beside the numerous small heathland streams , include the wümme , which rises on the western slopes of the wilseder berg , in the south the lachte with its tributary the lutter , and the aller , the vissel , the böhme , the grindau , the meiße and the örtze the landscape consists of flat plains of ground moraines , ridges of hilly terminal moraines and also of sandar - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet during the saalian stage ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) the area of the present-day lüneburg heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet due to the lack of vegetation , the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water , wind and by soil fluction ; this resulted in valleys like the totengrund the region is mostly covered by a heathland landscape consisting of big calluna and juniper areas , forests and some smaller swamps in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine unlike the other natural divisions of lüneburg heath , the terrain is quite rugged characteristic of the area are dry hilltops , periglacial dry valleys and hollows like the totengrund they are part of the lüneburg heath nature park and of great importance for tourism south heath : the south heath ( südheide ) is dominated by expanses of gently undulating , hilly sander plains , and sheets of ground moraine and the remains of end moraines from earlier ice ages there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however a large area of the südheide is covered by pine forests ostheide : numerous end moraines run through the ostheide ( '' east heath '' ) which stretches on the eastern edge of lüneburg heath from lüneburg to north of wolfsburg the northern area , the so-called göhrde and the drawehn , are by contrast mostly wooded like the southern ridge of end moraine uelzen basin and ilmenau depression : the ground moraine landscape of the uelzen basin is predominantly used for agriculture there are still large areas of heath here as well , for example the ellerndorfer heide ( '' ellerndorf heath '' ) in western uelzen district or the klein bünstorfer heide ( '' klein bünstorf heath '' ) the heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the elbe ; rivers such as the seeve , aue , luhe ( ilmenau ) other nature parks in the lüneburg heath region are the südheide nature park and elbufer-drawehn nature park the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath nevertheless , oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed the typical heath farming economy emerged : due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields , from which grain , in particular , could be produced as heather decomposes , the ph value of the soil falls drastically , as far as the iron buffer-region at ph 3 , which initiates the process of podsolisation soil life is severely damaged , which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the root zone on the heath at a depth of about the nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath the oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the middle ages as a result of the demand for wood by the lüneburg salt pans is incorrect the lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt , but they did not appear until around 1000 ad , by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years in any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath , but via the waterways , especially from mecklenburg up the elbe and from the area of the schaalsee the heath is not therefore a natural landscape , but a cultural landscape created by the intervention of man in the 20th century , numerous conservation measures were implemented on lüneburg heath ; as a result , it is one of the best researched regions of central europe this reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air , the increase in plant litter ( rohhumusauflagen ) and the natural ageing of the heathland ; lichen-rich sand heath ( flechtenreiche sandheide , genisto-callunetum cladonietosum ) the lichen-rich sand heaths can be told apart from the other types of heathland by the presence of various cladonia ( cladonia ) , marchantiophyta ( ptilidium ciliare ) and polytrichaceae ( polytrichum juniperinum ) they are found on the wilseder berg and south of niederhaverbeck this type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the wilseder berg , as well as the steingrund and totengrund its primary locations are areas north of wilsede and near the hörpel ponds ( hörpeler teichen ) wilsede heath museum ( heidemuseum wilsede ) was established in a fachhallenhaus and it gives an insight into the working and living conditions of a heathland farm around 1850 he worked the heath countryside into his books and promoted the foundation of the first german nature reserve on lüneburg heath three motorways ( autobahnen ) run across lüneburg heath , the a 7 , a 27 and a 250 , as well as various federal roads , the b 3 , b 71 , b 440 and others lüneburg heath nature park lüneburg heath nature reserve ahlden house auf der lüneburger heide ( song ) terminal moraine list of glacial moraines

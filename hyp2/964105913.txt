lüneburg heath is a sub-division of the north european plain in the list of the major natural regions of germany issued by the federal office for nature conservation ( bundesamt für naturschutz ) it is region number d28 the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln this region has no sharply defined boundary with the lüneburg heath lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest on the northwestern edge of lüneburg heath are the harburg hills and south of schneverdingen there are bogs , such as the pietzmoor also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) the eastern boundary to the wendland is formed by the göhrde-drawehn hills ( the ostheide natural region ) parts of lüneburg heath are in the südheide nature park , others in the lüneburg heath nature park image : wilseder berg 005.jpg left thumb wilseder berg the highest elevation on lüneburg heath is the wilseder berg above nn ) several of these hills - the wilseder berg , the falkenberg , the haußelberg and the breithorn - were used by the mathematician , carl friedrich gauss , as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the kingdom of hanover from 1821–1825 the immediate subsurface layers on lüneburg heath are almost exclusively made up of deposits from the quaternary ice age the landscape consists of flat plains of ground moraines , ridges of hilly terminal moraines and also of sandar - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet during the saalian stage ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) the area of the present-day lüneburg heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet in the last glacial period ( 110,000–10,000 years ago ) the ice sheet no longer covered the lüneburg heath area ; it reached only as far as the river elbe see also : drawehn , bullenkuhle , kieselgur the region is mostly covered by a heathland landscape consisting of big calluna and juniper areas , forests and some smaller swamps in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine unlike the other natural divisions of lüneburg heath , the terrain is quite rugged they are part of the lüneburg heath nature park and of great importance for tourism there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however it is part of the lüneburg heath nature reserve ostheide : numerous end moraines run through the ostheide ( '' east heath '' ) which stretches on the eastern edge of lüneburg heath from lüneburg to north of wolfsburg the northern area , the so-called göhrde and the drawehn , are by contrast mostly wooded like the southern ridge of end moraine on the surrounding ridges there are also a few pine forests however the heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the elbe ; rivers such as the seeve , aue , luhe ( ilmenau ) bfn lower saxony landscape profile phenologcal natural region map thumb lüneburg heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the atlantic , with mild winters , cool summers and precipitation all-year round thumb in the northwestern part of lüneburg heath is the lüneburg heath nature park which covers an area of other nature parks in the lüneburg heath region are the südheide nature park and elbufer-drawehn nature park the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe and within the former province ( regierungsbezirk ) of lüneburg there are no less than 212 individual nature reserves ( as at 31 december 2006 ) the heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the north german plain in which the hunter culture of the mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by neolithic farmers these open areas became dominated by the common heather ( calluna vulgaris ) , a largely grazing-resistant species of plant over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed soil life is severely damaged , which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the root zone on the heath at a depth of about the iron and humus particles released by the topsoil precipitate onto this impervious hardpan the nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath this reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air , the increase in plant litter ( rohhumusauflagen ) and the natural ageing of the heathland this type of heath is found west of niederhaverbeck and near sundermühlen there are only a very few old stands of sessile oaks , which stem from the logging industry during the time of the kingdom of hanover in many parts of the nature reserve there are so-called stühbüsche ( a form of coppice ) , trees that were coppiced by repeatedly being cut short in the meantime they have grown wild again and have a characteristic and unusual appearance with their multiple trunks the largest bog on lüneburg heath is the pietzmoor , which lies east of schneverdingen palynology show that the dry geest soils of north germany have been cultivated since about 3000 bc but even in the lüneburg heath nature reserve there are more than a thousand tumuli , especially near nieder- and oberhaverbeck in 1921 , a police ordinance placed more than 200 & nbsp ; km² of lüneburg heath under protection , the first time this had been achieved in germany not until the soltau-lüneburg agreement , was signed in 1959 between the federal republic of germany , the united kingdom and canada , were the boundaries of the tank training area fixed the memorial/exhibition at the former bergen-belsen concentration camp near the town of bergen is also located in the lüneburg heath lüneburg heath nature park lüneburg heath nature reserve ahlden house auf der lüneburger heide ( song ) terminal moraine list of glacial moraines

lüneburg heath is a sub-division of the north european plain in the list of the major natural regions of germany issued by the federal office for nature conservation ( bundesamt für naturschutz ) it is region number d28 the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln this region has no sharply defined boundary with the lüneburg heath lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest on the northwestern edge of lüneburg heath are the harburg hills and south of schneverdingen there are bogs , such as the pietzmoor also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) the eastern boundary to the wendland is formed by the göhrde-drawehn hills ( the ostheide natural region ) parts of lüneburg heath are in the südheide nature park , others in the lüneburg heath nature park image : wilseder berg 005.jpg left thumb wilseder berg the highest elevation on lüneburg heath is the wilseder berg above nn ) several of these hills - the wilseder berg , the falkenberg , the haußelberg and the breithorn - were used by the mathematician , carl friedrich gauss , as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the kingdom of hanover from 1821–1825 during the saalian stage ( 230,000–130,000 years ago ) the area of the present-day lüneburg heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine characteristic of the area are dry hilltops , periglacial dry valleys and hollows like the totengrund they are part of the lüneburg heath nature park and of great importance for tourism in addition there are also extensive pine forests south heath : the south heath ( südheide ) is dominated by expanses of gently undulating , hilly sander plains , and sheets of ground moraine and the remains of end moraines from earlier ice ages there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however it is part of the lüneburg heath nature reserve near schneverdingen and south of soltau there are several bogs a large area of the südheide is covered by pine forests ostheide : numerous end moraines run through the ostheide ( '' east heath '' ) which stretches on the eastern edge of lüneburg heath from lüneburg to north of wolfsburg uelzen basin and ilmenau depression : the ground moraine landscape of the uelzen basin is predominantly used for agriculture there are still large areas of heath here as well , for example the ellerndorfer heide ( '' ellerndorf heath '' ) in western uelzen district or the klein bünstorfer heide ( '' klein bünstorf heath '' ) luheheide : the ridges of end moraine on the luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the elbe valley the hohe heide , however , has a '' low mountain climate '' with lower temperatures and higher precipitation than in the surrounding area thumb in the northwestern part of lüneburg heath is the lüneburg heath nature park which covers an area of right in the north of the area is the harburg hills nature park the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe and within the former province ( regierungsbezirk ) of lüneburg there are no less than 212 individual nature reserves ( as at 31 december 2006 ) by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath this was a result of the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees these open areas became dominated by the common heather ( calluna vulgaris ) , a largely grazing-resistant species of plant nevertheless , oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed heinz ellenberg : vegetation mitteleuropas mit den alpen in ökologischer , dynamischer und historischer sicht , stuttgart 1996 , p as heather decomposes , the ph value of the soil falls drastically , as far as the iron buffer-region at ph 3 , which initiates the process of podsolisation the lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt , but they did not appear until around 1000 ad , by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years the heath is not therefore a natural landscape , but a cultural landscape created by the intervention of man in the 20th century , numerous conservation measures were implemented on lüneburg heath ; as a result , it is one of the best researched regions of central europe amongst them are the wavy hair-grass ( deschampsia flexuosa ) and common juniper ( juniperus communis ) this reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air , the increase in plant litter ( rohhumusauflagen ) and the natural ageing of the heathland this type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the wilseder berg , as well as the steingrund and totengrund near wilsede there is the remnant of a hutewald , a wood pasture with giant , multi-stemmed beech trees after the withdrawal of the lombards in the migration period , from about 700 ad lüneburg heath belonged to the duchy of saxony , which was conquered by charlemagne in the 9th century and became part of the frankish empire today , by contrast the only large , continuous areas of heath remaining are in the lüneburg heath nature reserve and on a few military training areas with the industrial revolution in germany , unspoilt nature became more important for people , providing a welcome contrast with the rapidly burgeoning cities left in the same year , an appeal by curt floerike appeared in kosmos magazine , citing the establishment of national parks in the united states and calling for them in germany in 1921 , a police ordinance placed more than 200 & nbsp ; km² of lüneburg heath under protection , the first time this had been achieved in germany lüneburg heath nature park lüneburg heath nature reserve ahlden house auf der lüneburger heide ( song ) terminal moraine list of glacial moraines

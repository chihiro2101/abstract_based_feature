lüneburg heath is a sub-division of the north european plain in the list of the major natural regions of germany issued by the federal office for nature conservation ( bundesamt für naturschutz ) it is region number d28 lüneburg heath covers an area which includes the districts ( landkreise ) of celle , gifhorn , heidekreis , uelzen , lüneburg , lüchow-dannenberg , southeast rotenburg ( the town of visselhövede , fintel , part of the municipality of scheeßel and the eastern half of bothel ) and the landkreis harburg the easternmost fringes of the stade geest belonging to landkreis verden are called the linteln geest ( lintelner geest ) or verden heath ( verdener heide ) and form part of the municipality of kirchlinteln this region has no sharply defined boundary with the lüneburg heath lüneburg heath lies between the rivers elbe to the north , the drawehn to the east , the aller to the south and southwest , the middle course of the wümme to the west and the harburg hills ( harburger berge ) to the northwest on the northwestern edge of lüneburg heath are the harburg hills and south of schneverdingen there are bogs , such as the pietzmoor also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes , like the grundloses moor ( '' bottomless bog '' ) near walsrode or the bullenkuhle near bokel ( part of sprakensehl ) the eastern boundary to the wendland is formed by the göhrde-drawehn hills ( the ostheide natural region ) parts of lüneburg heath are in the südheide nature park , others in the lüneburg heath nature park image : wilseder berg 005.jpg left thumb wilseder berg the highest elevation on lüneburg heath is the wilseder berg above nn ) several of these hills - the wilseder berg , the falkenberg , the haußelberg and the breithorn - were used by the mathematician , carl friedrich gauss , as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the kingdom of hanover from 1821–1825 the landscape consists of flat plains of ground moraines , ridges of hilly terminal moraines and also of sandar - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet in the last glacial period ( 110,000–10,000 years ago ) the ice sheet no longer covered the lüneburg heath area ; it reached only as far as the river elbe due to the lack of vegetation , the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water , wind and by soil fluction ; this resulted in valleys like the totengrund the region is mostly covered by a heathland landscape consisting of big calluna and juniper areas , forests and some smaller swamps in contrast to the areas in the north of lüneburg heath , the landscape is very hilly , as it is placed on a terminal moraine unlike the other natural divisions of lüneburg heath , the terrain is quite rugged they are part of the lüneburg heath nature park and of great importance for tourism south heath : the south heath ( südheide ) is dominated by expanses of gently undulating , hilly sander plains , and sheets of ground moraine and the remains of end moraines from earlier ice ages there are still large areas of heath on the bergen-hohne training area and munster ( örtze ) ; these are out-of-bounds to visitors however the osterheide near schneverdingen also belongs to this natural subdivision ostheide : numerous end moraines run through the ostheide ( '' east heath '' ) which stretches on the eastern edge of lüneburg heath from lüneburg to north of wolfsburg there are still large areas of heath here as well , for example the ellerndorfer heide ( '' ellerndorf heath '' ) in western uelzen district or the klein bünstorfer heide ( '' klein bünstorf heath '' ) there is hardly any heathland left in this area , it has been largely reforested by pines lüneburg heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the atlantic , with mild winters , cool summers and precipitation all-year round the hohe heide , however , has a '' low mountain climate '' with lower temperatures and higher precipitation than in the surrounding area thumb in the northwestern part of lüneburg heath is the lüneburg heath nature park which covers an area of other nature parks in the lüneburg heath region are the südheide nature park and elbufer-drawehn nature park the lüneburg heath nsg , together with the open heathland of the huge munster training area and the bergen-hohne training area , is the largest single area of heathland in central europe the heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the north german plain in which the hunter culture of the mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by neolithic farmers by about 3000 bc , during the neolithic , large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating , sandy stretches of geest on lüneburg heath over a long period of time the region of lüneburg heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed finally , after the migration period , the wooded areas of the region increased considerably 721 image : steingrund 009.jpg thumb herd of heidschnucken ( moorland sheep ) not until after 1000 ad does the pollen analysis show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in calluna the regular removal of the top layer of soil contributed to the spreading of heathland the iron and humus particles released by the topsoil precipitate onto this impervious hardpan the nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath the lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt , but they did not appear until around 1000 ad , by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years the amount required , even in the heyday of production , could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50 & nbsp ; km 2 in area , yet the heath covers over 7000 & nbsp ; km 2 in any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath , but via the waterways , especially from mecklenburg up the elbe and from the area of the schaalsee sand heaths form about 20 % of the lüneburg heath nature reserve and may be broken down into further sub-divisions , the most important being : thumb ; ordinary sand heath ( typische sandheide , genisto-callunetum ) in addition to the common heather ( calluna vulgaris ) only a few taller plants occur here , none of which can be classed as characteristic species blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes , the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges the nature park association carried out work in the 1980s to try to turn it back to its natural waterlogged state many species of animal live on lüneburg heath , particularly birds that are at home in the wide , open landscape , some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas the region was dominated by heath farming which was a less intensive form of land usage necessary for its large areas of barren terrain and heathland in rural parts of the region they still sometimes use today a low german dialect called heidjerisch history of conservation on lüneburg heath the area of lüneburg heath near wilsede was selected as the location for the north german national park lüneburg heath nature park lüneburg heath nature reserve ahlden house auf der lüneburger heide ( song ) terminal moraine list of glacial moraines

before the 12th century , traditional english law courts had been jointly presided over by a bishop and a local secular magistrate becket asserted that these secular courts had no jurisdiction over clergymen because it was the privilege of clergy not to be accused or tried for crime except before an ecclesiastical court as part of the compromise of avranches , henry was purged of any guilt in becket 's murder but he agreed that the secular courts , with few exceptions ( high treason being one of them , and forest law another ) , had no jurisdiction over the clergy in 1351 , under edward iii , this loophole was formalised in statute , and the benefit of clergy was officially extended to all who could read for example , the english dramatist ben jonson avoided hanging by pleading benefit of clergy in 1598 when charged with manslaughter the benefit of clergy was commonly applied as a means of judicial mercy : in elizabethan england , courts might allow more than 90 % of clergyable offenders the benefit of clergy , which is extremely high in light of the literacy rate of the period as a result of this leniency in the ecclesiastical courts , a number of reforms were undertaken to combat the abuse of the benefit of clergy in 1488 , henry vii decreed that non-clergymen should be allowed to plead the benefit of clergy only once : those pleading the benefit of clergy , but not able to prove through documentation of their holy orders that they actually were clergymen , were branded on the thumb , and the brand disqualified them from pleading the benefit of clergy in the future whereas before , the benefit was pleaded before a trial to have the case transferred to an ecclesiastical court , under the new system the benefit of clergy was pleaded after conviction but before sentencing , and it did not nullify the conviction , but rather changed the sentence for first-time offenders from probable hanging to branding and up to a year 's incarceration ( for example , before 1691 , women could plead the benefit of clergy if convicted of theft of goods valued less than 10 shillings , while men could plead clergy for thefts up to 40 shillings benefit of clergy was abolished in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland by two acts in 1823 , and parliament formally abolished benefit of clergy with the criminal law act 1827

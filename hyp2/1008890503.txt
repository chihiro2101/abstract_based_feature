one way to classify intersections is by the number of road segments ( arms ) that are involved a three-way junction is a junction between three road segments ( arms ) : a t junction when two arms form one road , or a y junction , the latter also known as a fork if approached from the stem of the y a four-way intersection , or crossroads , usually involves a crossing over of two streets or roads however , two roads may cross at a different angle in a few cases , the junction of two road segments may be offset from each when reaching an intersection , even though both ends may be considered the same street six-way intersections usually involve a crossing of three streets at one junction ; for example , a crossing of two perpendicular streets and a diagonal street is a rather common type of 6-way intersection yield-controlled intersections may or may not have specific yield signs ( known as '' give way '' signs in some countries ) signal-controlled intersections depend on traffic signals , usually electric , which indicate which traffic is allowed to proceed at any particular time a box junction can be added to an intersection , generally prohibiting entry to the intersection unless the exit is clear these techniques are generally used in conjunction with signal-controlled intersections , although they may also be used at stop-controlled intersections at intersections , turns are usually allowed , but are often regulated to avoid interference with other traffic red arrows may be displayed along with a circular green indication to show that turns in the direction of the arrow are prohibited , but other movements are allowed alternative intersection configurations , formerly called unconventional intersections , can manage turning traffic to increase safety and intersection throughput known as a pedestrian scramble , this type of vehicle all-way stop allows pedestrians to cross safely in any direction , including diagonally as such , it crosses streets and roads without going under or over them

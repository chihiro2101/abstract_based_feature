one way to classify intersections is by the number of road segments ( arms ) that are involved a three-way junction is a junction between three road segments ( arms ) : a t junction when two arms form one road , or a y junction , the latter also known as a fork if approached from the stem of the y a four-way intersection , or crossroads , usually involves a crossing over of two streets or roads in a few cases , the junction of two road segments may be offset from each when reaching an intersection , even though both ends may be considered the same street six-way intersections usually involve a crossing of three streets at one junction ; for example , a crossing of two perpendicular streets and a diagonal street is a rather common type of 6-way intersection another way of classifying intersections is by traffic control technology : uncontrolled intersections , without signs or signals ( or sometimes with a warning sign ) priority ( right-of-way ) rules may vary by country : on a 4-way intersection traffic from the right often has priority ; on a 3-way intersection either traffic from the right has priority again , or traffic on the continuing road yield-controlled intersections may or may not have specific yield signs ( known as '' give way '' signs in some countries ) signal-controlled intersections depend on traffic signals , usually electric , which indicate which traffic is allowed to proceed at any particular time these techniques are generally used in conjunction with signal-controlled intersections , although they may also be used at stop-controlled intersections certain turns may be not allowed or may be limited by regulatory signs or signals , particularly those that cross oncoming traffic , a left turn in right-side driving countries , or a right turn in left-side driving countries ) , or to exit a road without crossing traffic ( i.e green arrows indicate protected turn phases , when vehicles may turn unhindered by oncoming traffic without a separate phase , left crossing traffic does not get the full safety benefit of the turn lane intersections generally must manage pedestrian as well as vehicle traffic

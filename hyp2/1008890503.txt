in a few cases , the junction of two road segments may be offset from each when reaching an intersection , even though both ends may be considered the same street six-way intersections usually involve a crossing of three streets at one junction ; for example , a crossing of two perpendicular streets and a diagonal street is a rather common type of 6-way intersection another way of classifying intersections is by traffic control technology : uncontrolled intersections , without signs or signals ( or sometimes with a warning sign ) priority ( right-of-way ) rules may vary by country : on a 4-way intersection traffic from the right often has priority ; on a 3-way intersection either traffic from the right has priority again , or traffic on the continuing road signal-controlled intersections depend on traffic signals , usually electric , which indicate which traffic is allowed to proceed at any particular time jughandle lefts diverge to the right , then curve to the left , converting a left turn to a crossing maneuver , similar to throughabouts at intersections , turns are usually allowed , but are often regulated to avoid interference with other traffic at intersections with large proportions of turning traffic , turn lanes ( also known as turn bays ) may be provided , a left turn in right-side driving countries , or a right turn in left-side driving countries ) , or to exit a road without crossing traffic ( i.e , a right turn in right-side driving countries , or a left turn in left-side driving countries ) , safety effectiveness of intersection left- and right-turn lanes , federal highway administration office of safety research and development , 2002 , turn lanes are marked with an arrow bending into the direction of the turn which is to be made from that lane traffic signals facing vehicles in turn lanes often have arrow-shaped indications red arrows may be displayed along with a circular green indication to show that turns in the direction of the arrow are prohibited , but other movements are allowed a green arrow may also be provided ; when it is on , drivers heading in the direction of the arrow may proceed , but must yield to all other vehicles without a separate phase , left crossing traffic does not get the full safety benefit of the turn lane

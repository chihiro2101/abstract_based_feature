akiva ben yosef ( written aqívā in the babylonian talmud and aqívāh in the jerusalem talmud ) was of humble parentage jerusalem talmud berakhot chapter 4 , page 7d , talmud berakhot 27b his wife 's first name is not provided in earlier sources , but a later version of the tradition gives it as rachel avot of rabbi natan , ed solomon schechter , 4:29 she stood loyally by her husband during the period of his late initiation into rabbinic studies after he was 40 years of age and in which akiva dedicated himself to the study of torah a different tradition narrates that at the age of 40 , akiva attended the academy of his native town , lod , presided over by eliezer ben hurcanus hurcanus was a neighbor of yosef , the father of akiva the fact that eliezer was his first teacher , and the only one whom akiva later designates as '' rabbi '' , is of importance in settling the date of akiva 's birth besides eliezer , akiva studied under joshua ben hananiah and nachum ish gamzu rabbi tarfon was considered as one of akiva 's masters , babylonian talmud ketubot 84b but the pupil outranked his teacher and he became one of akiva 's greatest admirers sifre , book of numbers 75 akiva remained in lod rosh hashanah 1:6 as long as eliezer dwelt there , and then moved his own school to beneberak babylonian talmud sanhedrin 32b ; tosefta shabbat 3:4:3 akiva also lived for some time at ziphron , sifre on numbers 5:8 modern zafran z see and the parallel passages quoted in the talmudical dictionaries of levy and jastrow according to the talmud , akiva was a shepherd for ben kalba sabu ' a when the latter 's daughter noticed his modesty and fine character traits she offered to marry him if he would agree to begin studying torah , as at the time he was 40 years old and illiterate he drove his daughter out of his house , swearing that he would never help her while akiva remained her husband akiva and his wife lived in such poverty that they used straw for their bed the talmud relates that once elijah the prophet assumed the guise of a poor man and came to their door to beg some straw for a bed for his wife after she had given birth nedarim 50a by agreement with his wife , akiva spent twelve years away from home , pursuing his studies but akiva exclaimed , '' let her alone ; for what is mine and yours , is hers '' ( she deserves the credit for our torah study ) not knowing who he was , ben kalba sabu ' a also approached akiva and asked him for help annulling his vow to disown his daughter and her husband akiva said to him , '' i am that man '' akiva is reported to have had a rabbinic relationship with rabban gamaliel dated to before their trip to rome convinced of the necessity of a central authority for judaism , akiva became a devoted adherent and friend of rabban gamaliel , who aimed at constituting the patriarch the true spiritual chief of the jews yevamot 16:7 during his travels , it is probable that he visited other places having important jewish communities akiva allegedly took part in the bar kokhba revolt of 132–136 , but his role here can not be historically determined midrash shoher tov , on proverbs ( § 9 ) , jerusalem 1968 as this story credits the execution to religious rather than political reasons , it may be evidence against akiva 's having a role in the revolt 121 that the religious interdicts of hadrian preceded the overthrow of bar kochba is shown by the mekhilta mekhilta mishpaṭim 18 , where akiva regards the martyrdom of two of his friends as ominous of his own fate the most common version of akiva 's death is that the roman government ordered him to stop teaching torah , on pain of death , and that he refused he says to them , '' all my life i was worried about the verse , 'with all your soul ' ( and the sages expounded this to signify ) , even if he takes away your soul a heavenly voice went out and announced : '' blessed are you , rabbi akiva , that your life expired with '' echad '' annually , on the night of lag baomer , boston chassidim and local residents gather at the tomb of rebbe akiva to light a bonfire , a tradition reinstated by the bostoner rebbe in 1983 mishpacha , family first supplement , p a tannaitic tradition mentions that of the four who entered paradise , akiva was the only one that returned unscathed strict monotheist that akiva was , he protested against any comparison of god with the angels , and declared the plain interpretation of כאחד ממנו genesis 3:22 as meaning '' like one of us '' to be arrant blasphemy yoma , 75b this view of akiva 's , in spite of the energetic protests of his colleague rabbi ishmael , became the one generally accepted by his contemporaries , 57 , indicates from his views as to the relation between god and man , he deduces that a murderer is to be considered as committing the crime against the divine archetype ( דמות ) of man 14a hence his maxim , referred to above , '' god rules the world in mercy , but according to the preponderance of good or bad in human acts buber , 9 73a consistent as akiva always was , his ethics and his views of justice were only the strict consequences of his philosophical system justice as an attribute of god must also be exemplary for man he protested strongly against the canonicity of certain of the apocrypha , the wisdom of sirach , for instance , sanh rosenthal , bet talmud , 2:280 akiva worked in the domain of the halakha , both in the systematization of its traditional material and in its further development means for the theoretical study of the halachah were also scant ; both logic and exegesis—the two props of the halakah—being differently conceived by the various ruling tannaim , and differently taught according to a tradition ( which has historical confirmation ) , it was akiva who systematized and arranged the '' mishna '' ( the halakhic codex ) ; the '' midrash '' ( the exegesis of the halachah ) , and the '' halachot '' ( the logical amplification of the halachah ) 67a and dünner , in monatsschrift , 20 453 , also w the mishna of akiva , as his pupil rabbi meir had taken it from him , became the basis of the six orders of the mishna at the same time , it is fair to consider the mishnah of judah ha-nasi ( called simply '' the mishnah '' ) , as well as the majority of all halakhic midrashim now extant , as derived from the school of akiva according to johanan bar nappaḥa ( 199–279 ) , '' our mishnah comes directly from rabbi meir , the tosefta from r as the fundamental principle of his system , akiva enunciates his conviction that the mode of expression used by the torah is quite different from that of every other book legendary allusion to this change in akiva 's life is made in two slightly varying forms once he was called upon to decide between a dark-skinned king and the king 's wife ;

akiva ben yosef ( written aqívā in the babylonian talmud and aqívāh in the jerusalem talmud ) was of humble parentage jerusalem talmud berakhot chapter 4 , page 7d , talmud berakhot 27b his wife 's first name is not provided in earlier sources , but a later version of the tradition gives it as rachel solomon schechter , 4:29 she stood loyally by her husband during the period of his late initiation into rabbinic studies after he was 40 years of age a different tradition narrates that at the age of 40 , akiva attended the academy of his native town , lod , presided over by eliezer ben hurcanus hurcanus was a neighbor of yosef , the father of akiva the fact that eliezer was his first teacher , and the only one whom akiva later designates as '' rabbi '' , is of importance in settling the date of akiva 's birth these legends set the beginning of his years of study at about 75–80 babylonian talmud hagigah 12a he was on equal footing with gamaliel ii , whom he met later rabbi tarfon was considered as one of akiva 's masters , babylonian talmud ketubot 84b but the pupil outranked his teacher and he became one of akiva 's greatest admirers sifre , book of numbers 75 akiva remained in lod rosh hashanah 1:6 as long as eliezer dwelt there , and then moved his own school to beneberak according to the talmud , akiva was a shepherd for ben kalba sabu ' a when the latter 's daughter noticed his modesty and fine character traits he drove his daughter out of his house , swearing that he would never help her while akiva remained her husband akiva and his wife lived in such poverty that they used straw for their bed the talmud relates that once elijah the prophet assumed the guise of a poor man and came to their door to beg some straw for a bed for his wife after she had given birth when akiva and his wife saw that there were people even poorer than they , rachel said to him , '' go , and become a scholar '' nedarim 50a by agreement with his wife , akiva spent twelve years away from home , pursuing his studies david hadad , sefer ma'asei avot , beer sheva 2005 , p 202 , citing avot de-rabbi nathan , chapter 6 '' without crossing the threshold , akiva went back to the academy but akiva exclaimed , '' let her alone ; for what is mine and yours , is hers '' ( she deserves the credit for our torah study ) not knowing who he was , ben kalba sabu ' a also approached akiva and asked him for help annulling his vow to disown his daughter and her husband akiva said to him , '' i am that man '' the greatest tannaim of the middle of the second century came from akiva 's school , notably rabbi meir , judah bar ilai , simeon bar yochai , jose ben halafta , eleazar ben shammai , and rabbi nehemiah convinced of the necessity of a central authority for judaism , akiva became a devoted adherent and friend of rabban gamaliel , who aimed at constituting the patriarch the true spiritual chief of the jews nedarim 40a ; leviticus rabbah 34:16 ; tosefta megillah 4:16 in 95–96 , akiva was in rome , heinrich graetz , gesch yevamot 16:7 during his travels , it is probable that he visited other places having important jewish communities akiva allegedly took part in the bar kokhba revolt of 132–136 , but his role here can not be historically determined jewish sources relate that he was subjected to combing , a roman torture in which the victim 's skin was flayed with iron combs the death of akiva is usually rendered as some redacted form of three separate versions of the circumstances the most common version of akiva 's death is that the roman government ordered him to stop teaching torah , on pain of death , and that he refused talmud yerushalmi berachot 9 14b , and somewhat modified in babylonian talmud 61b the version in the babylonian talmud tells it as a response of akiva to his students , who asked him how he could yet offer prayers to god a heavenly voice went out and announced : '' blessed are you , rabbi akiva , that your life expired with '' echad '' jellinek , beit ha-midrash , 6:27,28 ; 2:67,68 ; braunschweiger , lehrer der mischnah , 192–206 rebbe akiva 's modern day tomb is located in tiberias 14b ; tosefta hagigah 2:3 this serves at least to show how strong in later ages was the recollection of akiva 's philosophical speculation akiva 's opinion about the creation of man is recorded in pirkei avot : : how favored is man , for he was created after an image ; as scripture says , '' for in an image , god made man strict monotheist that akiva was , he protested against any comparison of god with the angels , and declared the plain interpretation of כאחד ממנו genesis 3:22 as meaning '' like one of us '' to be arrant blasphemy yoma , 75b this view of akiva 's , in spite of the energetic protests of his colleague rabbi ishmael , became the one generally accepted by his contemporaries genesis rabbah 34:14 similarly , he recognizes as the chief and greatest principle of judaism the command , '' thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself weiss ) for , in spite of his philosophy , akiva was an extremely strict and national jew 14a hence his maxim , referred to above , '' god rules the world in mercy , but according to the preponderance of good or bad in human acts concerning end times , akiva interpreted bible prophecy using what is now called the historicist methodology , which recognizes the day-year principle and the four kingdoms of daniel ( i.e genesis rabbah 33 ; pesiḳ buber , 9 73a consistent as akiva always was , his ethics and his views of justice were only the strict consequences of his philosophical system 49a , and חיצונים according to its aramaic equivalent ברייתא ; so that akiva 's utterance reads , '' he who reads aloud in the synagogue from books not belonging to the canon as if they were canonical , '' etc but he was not opposed to a private reading of the apocrypha , as is evident from the fact that he himself makes frequent use of sirach dor , 2:97 aquila , meanwhile , was a disciple of akiva and , under akiva 's guidance , gave the greek-speaking jews a rabbinical bible akiva worked in the domain of the halakha , both in the systematization of its traditional material and in its further development the lack of any systematized collection of the accumulated halachot rendered impossible any presentation of them in form suitable for practical purposes means for the theoretical study of the halachah were also scant ; both logic and exegesis—the two props of the halakah—being differently conceived by the various ruling tannaim , and differently taught according to a tradition ( which has historical confirmation ) , it was akiva who systematized and arranged the '' mishna '' ( the halakhic codex ) ; the '' midrash '' ( the exegesis of the halachah ) , and the '' halachot '' ( the logical amplification of the halachah ) mekhilta of rabbi ishmael , mishpaṭim , 3 how akiva endeavors to substantiate this from the hebrew text is shown by a 68a for similar reasons , akiva comes near abolishing the biblical ordinance of kil'ayim ; nearly every chapter in the treatise of that name contains a mitigation by akiva love for the holy land , which he as a genuine nationalist frequently and warmly expressed , avot of rabbi natan 26 was so powerful with him that he would have exempted agriculture from much of the rigor of the law akiva , however , was not to be turned from his purpose ;

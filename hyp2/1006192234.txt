akiva ben yosef ( written aqívā in the babylonian talmud and aqívāh in the jerusalem talmud ) was of humble parentage his wife 's first name is not provided in earlier sources , but a later version of the tradition gives it as rachel solomon schechter , 4:29 she stood loyally by her husband during the period of his late initiation into rabbinic studies after he was 40 years of age the fact that eliezer was his first teacher , and the only one whom akiva later designates as '' rabbi '' , is of importance in settling the date of akiva 's birth these legends set the beginning of his years of study at about 75–80 besides eliezer , akiva studied under joshua ben hananiah and nachum ish gamzu babylonian talmud hagigah 12a he was on equal footing with gamaliel ii , whom he met later rabbi tarfon was considered as one of akiva 's masters , babylonian talmud ketubot 84b but the pupil outranked his teacher and he became one of akiva 's greatest admirers sifre , book of numbers 75 akiva remained in lod rosh hashanah 1:6 as long as eliezer dwelt there , and then moved his own school to beneberak babylonian talmud sanhedrin 32b ; tosefta shabbat 3:4:3 akiva also lived for some time at ziphron , sifre on numbers 5:8 modern zafran z & nbsp ; 391 , and jastrow , l.c according to the talmud , akiva was a shepherd for ben kalba sabu ' a when the latter 's daughter noticed his modesty and fine character traits she offered to marry him if he would agree to begin studying torah , as at the time he was 40 years old and illiterate when akiva and his wife saw that there were people even poorer than they , rachel said to him , '' go , and become a scholar '' nedarim 50a by agreement with his wife , akiva spent twelve years away from home , pursuing his studies he would make a living by cutting wood from the forest , selling half for his wife 's and children 's upkeep , and using the other half for keeping a fire burning at night to keep himself warm and to provide light thereby for his own studies returning at the end of twelve years accompanied by 12,000 disciples , on the point of entering his home he overheard his wife say to a neighbor who was critical of his long absence : '' if i had my wish , he should stay another twelve years at the academy not knowing who he was , ben kalba sabu ' a also approached akiva and asked him for help annulling his vow to disown his daughter and her husband akiva asked him , '' would you have made your vow if you had known that he would become a great scholar ? '' ben kalba sabu ' a replied , '' had i known that he would learn even one chapter or one single halakha , i would not have made the vow '' ben kalba sabu ' a fell at akiva 's feet and gave him half his wealth the greatest tannaim of the middle of the second century came from akiva 's school , notably rabbi meir , judah bar ilai , simeon bar yochai , jose ben halafta , eleazar ben shammai , and rabbi nehemiah besides these , akiva had many disciples whose names have not been handed down , but the aggadah variously gives their number as 12,000 , genesis rabbah 61:3 24,000 yevamot 62b and 48,000 akiva is reported to have had a rabbinic relationship with rabban gamaliel dated to before their trip to rome convinced of the necessity of a central authority for judaism , akiva became a devoted adherent and friend of rabban gamaliel , who aimed at constituting the patriarch the true spiritual chief of the jews nedarim 40a ; leviticus rabbah 34:16 ; tosefta megillah 4:16 in 95–96 , akiva was in rome , heinrich graetz , gesch akiva 's death occurred after several years of imprisonment , sanhedrin 12a which places it at about 132 , before the suppression of the bar kochba revolution ; otherwise the delay of the romans in executing him would be quite inexplicable frankel , '' darkei hamishnah , '' p jewish sources relate that he was subjected to combing , a roman torture in which the victim 's skin was flayed with iron combs the death of akiva is usually rendered as some redacted form of three separate versions of the circumstances talmud yerushalmi berachot 9 14b , and somewhat modified in babylonian talmud 61b the version in the babylonian talmud tells it as a response of akiva to his students , who asked him how he could yet offer prayers to god a heavenly voice went out and announced : '' blessed are you , rabbi akiva , that your life expired with '' echad '' when they arrived , elijah and joshua entered a cavern that contained a bed , table , chair , and lamp , and deposited akiva 's body there a tannaitic tradition mentions that of the four who entered paradise , akiva was the only one that returned unscathed akiva 's opinion about the creation of man is recorded in pirkei avot : : how favored is man , for he was created after an image ; as scripture says , '' for in an image , god made man strict monotheist that akiva was , he protested against any comparison of god with the angels , and declared the plain interpretation of כאחד ממנו genesis 3:22 as meaning '' like one of us '' to be arrant blasphemy mekhilta of rabbi ishmael , beshallaḥ 6 it is quite instructive to read how a christian of akiva 's generation , justin martyr , calls the literal interpretation—thus objected to by akiva—a '' jewish heretical one '' 62 in his earnest endeavors to insist as strongly as possible upon the incomparable nature of god , akiva indeed lowers the angels somewhat to the realms of mortals , and ( alluding to psalms 78:25 ) maintains that manna is the actual food of the angels akiva was instrumental in drawing up the canon of the tanakh 49a , and חיצונים according to its aramaic equivalent ברייתא ; so that akiva 's utterance reads , '' he who reads aloud in the synagogue from books not belonging to the canon as if they were canonical , '' etc & nbsp ; 169 respecting akiva 's attitude toward the canonicity of the song of songs were viewed as misconceptions by i.h dor , 2:97 aquila , meanwhile , was a disciple of akiva and , under akiva 's guidance , gave the greek-speaking jews a rabbinical bible akiva worked in the domain of the halakha , both in the systematization of its traditional material and in its further development the condition of the halakah , that is , of religious praxis , and indeed of judaism in general , was a very precarious one at the turn of the 1st century of the common era means for the theoretical study of the halachah were also scant ; both logic and exegesis—the two props of the halakah—being differently conceived by the various ruling tannaim , and differently taught the mishna of akiva , as his pupil rabbi meir had taken it from him , became the basis of the six orders of the mishna the δευτερώσεις τοῦ καλουμένου ραββὶ ακιβά ( mishnah of the one called '' rabbi akiva '' ) mentioned by epiphanius , panarion , 33:9 , and 15 , end as well as the '' great mishnayot of akiva '' , in the midr the opposition offered by the sadducees ( which became especially strenuous in the first century bc ) led to the development the halakhic midrash , whose purpose was to deduce these amplifications of the law , by tradition and logic , out of the law itself the example of his colleagues and friends , elisha ben abuyah , ben azzai , and ben zoma strengthened him still more in his conviction of the necessity of providing some counterpoise to the intellectual influence of the non-jewish world as the fundamental principle of his system , akiva enunciates his conviction that the mode of expression used by the torah is quite different from that of every other book every peculiarity of diction , every particle , every sign , is to be considered as of higher importance , as having a wider relation and as being of deeper meaning than it seems to have ) some deep reference to philosophical and ethical doctrines , akiva perceived in them indications of many important ceremonial laws , legal statutes , and ethical teachings 4:427 he thus gave the jewish mind not only a new field for its own employment , but , convinced both of the immutability of tanakh and of the necessity for development in judaism , he succeeded in reconciling these two apparently hopeless opposites by means of his remarkable method sifra , meẓora , end ; shabbat 64b the biblical legislation in exodus 21:7 could not be reconciled by akiva with his view of jewish ethics : for him a '' jewish slave '' is a contradiction in terms , for every jew is to be regarded as a prince legendary allusion to this change in akiva 's life is made in two slightly varying forms his five main students were judah bar ilai , rabbi meir , rabbi eleazar ben shammua , jose ben halafta and shimon bar yochai berachot 60b another legend according to which the gates of the infernal regions opened for akiva is analogous to the more familiar tale that he entered paradise and was allowed to leave it unscathed

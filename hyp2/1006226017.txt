broadly speaking , there are two possible approaches to linguistic transcription phonetic transcription focuses on phonetic and phonological properties of spoken language systems for phonetic transcription thus furnish rules for mapping individual sounds or phones to written symbols systems for orthographic transcription , by contrast , consist of rules for mapping spoken words onto written forms as prescribed by the orthography of a given language phonetic transcription operates with specially defined character sets , usually the international phonetic alphabet which type of transcription is chosen depends mostly on the research interests pursued since phonetic transcription strictly foregrounds the phonetic nature of language , it is most useful for phonetic or phonological analyses orthographic transcription , on the other hand , has a morphological and a lexical component alongside the phonetic component ( which aspect is represented to which degree depends on the language and orthography in question ) it is thus more convenient wherever meaning-related aspects of spoken language are investigated phonetic transcription is doubtlessly more systematic in a scientific sense , but it is also harder to learn , more time-consuming to carry out and less widely applicable than orthographic transcription there is no predetermined system for distinguishing and classifying these components and , consequently , no preset way of mapping these components onto written symbols transcription systems are sets of rules which define how spoken language is to be represented in written symbols most phonetic transcription systems are based on the international phonetic alphabet or , especially in speech technology , on its derivative sampa examples for orthographic transcription systems ( all from the field of conversation analysis or related fields ) are : the field of conversation analysis itself includes a number of distinct approaches to transcription and sets of transcription conventions the jefferson transcription system is a set of symbols , developed by gail jefferson , which is used for transcribing talk two types of transcription software can be used to assist the process of transcription : one that facilitates manual transcription and the other automated transcription interlinear gloss phonetic transcription speech recognition subtitle ( captioning ) textual scholarship transcription ( service ) transcription software transcription in action - website from uc santa barbara documentation and examples for the hiat transcription system transcription - a website with resources for transcription in conversation analysis

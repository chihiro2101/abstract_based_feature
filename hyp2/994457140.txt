temperament and the wolf if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in other tuning systems ( such as pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone ) , eleven fifths may have a size of 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; ε cents , thus the diminished sixth is 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 11ε cents if 11ε is very large , as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system , the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth in terms of frequency ratios , the product of the fifths must be 128 , and if f is the size of a fifth , 128 : f 11 , or f 11 :128 , will be the size of the wolf if the diminished sixth is a wolf interval , this triad is called the wolf major triad in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth these thirds therefore hardly deserve the appellation of wolf , and in fact historically have not been given that name five-limit tuning determines one diminished sixth of size 1024:675 ( about 722 cents , i.e five-limit tuning also creates two impure perfect fifths of size 40:27 ( about 680 cents ; less pure than the 3:2 pythagorean perfect fifth ) the impure perfect fourth and perfect fifth are sometimes simply called imperfect fourth and fifth this is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios ( for instance , those tuned using 12-tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament ) when the perfect fifth is tempered to be exactly 700 cents wide ( that is , tempered by approximately of a syntonic comma , or exactly of a pythagorean comma ) then the tuning is identical to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament

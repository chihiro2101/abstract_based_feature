if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in other tuning systems ( such as pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone ) , eleven fifths may have a size of 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; ε cents , thus the diminished sixth is 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 11ε cents if 11ε is very large , as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system , the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth three of these diminished fourths form major triads with perfect fifths , but one of them forms a major triad with the diminished sixth similarly , we obtain nine minor thirds of 300 & nbsp ; ± & nbsp ; 3ε cents and three minor thirds ( or augmented seconds ) of 300 & nbsp ; ∓ & nbsp ; 9ε cents in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth the flat minor thirds are only about 2.335 cents sharper than a subminor third of size 7:6 , and the sharp major thirds , of size exactly 32:25 , are about 7.712 cents flatter than the supermajor third of 9:7 in pythagorean tuning , there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a pythagorean comma ) , and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that , which is 23.460 cents ( one pythagorean comma ) flatter than a just fifth a fifth this flat can also be regarded as howling like a wolf whether this interval should be considered dissonant enough to be called a wolf fifth is a controversial matter the impure perfect fourth and perfect fifth are sometimes simply called imperfect fourth and fifth this is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios ( for instance , those tuned using 12-tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament ) with a more extreme meantone temperament , like 19 equal temperament , the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth , and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth

in 12-tone scales , the average value of the twelve fifths must equal the 700 cents of equal temperament if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in other tuning systems ( such as pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone ) , eleven fifths may have a size of 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; ε cents , thus the diminished sixth is 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 11ε cents if 11ε is very large , as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system , the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth three of these diminished fourths form major triads with perfect fifths , but one of them forms a major triad with the diminished sixth if the diminished sixth is a wolf interval , this triad is called the wolf major triad in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth namely , while pythagorean tuning determines only 2 wolf intervals ( a fifth and a fourth ) , the 5-limit symmetric scales produce 12 of them , and the asymmetric scale 14 five-limit tuning determines one diminished sixth of size 1024:675 ( about 722 cents , i.e five-limit tuning also creates two impure perfect fifths of size 40:27 ( about 680 cents ; less pure than the 3:2 pythagorean perfect fifth ) these are not diminished sixths , but relative to the pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant ( about 20 cents flatter ) and hence , they might be considered to be wolf fifths the impure perfect fourth and perfect fifth are sometimes simply called imperfect fourth and fifth a fifth of the size mozart favored , at or near the 55-equal fifth of 698.182 cents , will have a wolf of 720 cents , 18.045 cents sharper than a justly tuned fifth

in 12-tone scales , the average value of the twelve fifths must equal the 700 cents of equal temperament if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in other tuning systems ( such as pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone ) , eleven fifths may have a size of 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; ε cents , thus the diminished sixth is 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 11ε cents if 11ε is very large , as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system , the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth in terms of frequency ratios , the product of the fifths must be 128 , and if f is the size of a fifth , 128 : f 11 , or f 11 :128 , will be the size of the wolf if the diminished sixth is a wolf interval , this triad is called the wolf major triad in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth in pythagorean tuning , there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a pythagorean comma ) , and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that , which is 23.460 cents ( one pythagorean comma ) flatter than a just fifth 5-limit tuning yields a much larger number of wolf intervals with respect to pythagorean tuning , which can be considered a 3-limit just intonation tuning five-limit tuning also creates two impure perfect fifths of size 40:27 ( about 680 cents ; less pure than the 3:2 pythagorean perfect fifth ) this is also true for any perfect fourth or perfect fifth which slightly deviates from the perfectly consonant 4:3 or 3:2 ratios ( for instance , those tuned using 12-tone equal or quarter-comma meantone temperament ) a fifth of the size mozart favored , at or near the 55-equal fifth of 698.182 cents , will have a wolf of 720 cents , 18.045 cents sharper than a justly tuned fifth with a more extreme meantone temperament , like 19 equal temperament , the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth , and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth

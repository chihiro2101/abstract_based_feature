in 12-tone scales , the average value of the twelve fifths must equal the 700 cents of equal temperament if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in other tuning systems ( such as pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone ) , eleven fifths may have a size of 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; ε cents , thus the diminished sixth is 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 11ε cents major thirds must average 400 cents , and to each pair of thirds of size 400 & nbsp ; ∓ & nbsp ; 4ε cents we have a third ( or diminished fourth ) of 400 & nbsp ; ± & nbsp ; 8ε cents , leading to eight thirds 4ε cents narrower or wider , and four diminished fourths 8ε cents wider or narrower than average similarly , we obtain nine minor thirds of 300 & nbsp ; ± & nbsp ; 3ε cents and three minor thirds ( or augmented seconds ) of 300 & nbsp ; ∓ & nbsp ; 9ε cents in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth the flat minor thirds are only about 2.335 cents sharper than a subminor third of size 7:6 , and the sharp major thirds , of size exactly 32:25 , are about 7.712 cents flatter than the supermajor third of 9:7 in pythagorean tuning , there are eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a pythagorean comma ) , and hence one fifth will be flatter by twelve times that , which is 23.460 cents ( one pythagorean comma ) flatter than a just fifth five-limit tuning also creates two impure perfect fifths of size 40:27 ( about 680 cents ; less pure than the 3:2 pythagorean perfect fifth ) these are not diminished sixths , but relative to the pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant ( about 20 cents flatter ) and hence , they might be considered to be wolf fifths a fifth of the size mozart favored , at or near the 55-equal fifth of 698.182 cents , will have a wolf of 720 cents , 18.045 cents sharper than a justly tuned fifth with a more extreme meantone temperament , like 19 equal temperament , the wolf is large enough that it is closer in size to a sixth than a fifth , and sounds like a different interval altogether rather than a mistuned fifth for example , the wicki keyboard shown in figure 1 is generated by the same musical intervals as the syntonic temperament — that is , by the octave and tempered perfect fifth — so they are isomorphic

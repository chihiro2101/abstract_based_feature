in 12-tone scales , the average value of the twelve fifths must equal the 700 cents of equal temperament if eleven of them have a value of 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; ε cents , as in quarter-comma meantone and most other meantone temperament tuning systems , the other fifth ( more properly called a diminished sixth ) will equal 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; 11ε cents in other tuning systems ( such as pythagorean tuning and twelfth-comma meantone ) , eleven fifths may have a size of 700 & nbsp ; + & nbsp ; ε cents , thus the diminished sixth is 700 & nbsp ; − & nbsp ; 11ε cents if 11ε is very large , as in the quarter-comma meantone tuning system , the diminished sixth is regarded as a wolf fifth three of these diminished fourths form major triads with perfect fifths , but one of them forms a major triad with the diminished sixth if the diminished sixth is a wolf interval , this triad is called the wolf major triad in quarter-comma meantone , the fifth is of size , about 3.42157 cents ( or exactly one twelfth of a diesis ) flatter than 700 cents , and so the wolf is about 737.637 cents , or 35.682 cents sharper than a perfect fifth of size exactly 3:2 , and this is the original howling wolf fifth the flat minor thirds are only about 2.335 cents sharper than a subminor third of size 7:6 , and the sharp major thirds , of size exactly 32:25 , are about 7.712 cents flatter than the supermajor third of 9:7 namely , while pythagorean tuning determines only 2 wolf intervals ( a fifth and a fourth ) , the 5-limit symmetric scales produce 12 of them , and the asymmetric scale 14 these are not diminished sixths , but relative to the pythagorean perfect fifth they are less consonant ( about 20 cents flatter ) and hence , they might be considered to be wolf fifths a fifth of the size mozart favored , at or near the 55-equal fifth of 698.182 cents , will have a wolf of 720 cents , 18.045 cents sharper than a justly tuned fifth for example , the wicki keyboard shown in figure 1 is generated by the same musical intervals as the syntonic temperament — that is , by the octave and tempered perfect fifth — so they are isomorphic a keyboard that is isomorphic with the syntonic temperament , such as wicki 's keyboard above , retains its isomorphism in any tuning within the tuning continuum of the syntonic temperament , even when changing tuning dynamically among such tunings

in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size a slightly different form of bottleneck can occur if a small group becomes reproductively ( e.g alternatively , invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago in 2000 , a molecular biology and evolution paper suggested a transplanting model or a 'long bottleneck ' to account for the limited genetic variation , rather than a catastrophic environmental change this would be consistent with suggestions that in sub-saharan africa numbers could have dropped at times as low as 2,000 , for perhaps as long as 100,000 years , before numbers began to expand again in the late stone age with so much of a colony 's offspring descended from just one dominant male , genetic diversity is limited , making the species more vulnerable to diseases and genetic mutations there is also evidence of at least one primate species , the golden snub-nosed monkey , that also suffered from a bottleneck around this time the bottlenecks likely caused the low genetic diversity observed in both species the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck the low amount of polymorphic loci in the outplanted individuals led to the population bottleneck , causing the loss of the marker allele at eight of the loci baby boom founder effect population boom small population size

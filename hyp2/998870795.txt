minimum viable population size in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size alternatively , invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago the animals living today are all descended from 12 individuals and they have extremely low genetic variation , which may be beginning to affect the reproductive ability of bulls left a classic example of a population bottleneck is that of the northern elephant seal , whose population fell to about 30 in the 1890s although it now numbers in the hundreds of thousands , the potential for bottlenecks within colonies remains an extreme example of a population bottleneck is the new zealand black robin , of which every specimen today is a descendant of a single female , called old blue the genome of the giant panda shows evidence of a severe bottleneck about 43,000 years ago the disappearance of a central population poses a major threat of population bottleneck the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck baby boom founder effect population boom small population size

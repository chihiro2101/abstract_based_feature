minimum viable population size in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago it is believed that additional bottlenecks must have occurred since homo erectus started walking the earth , but current archaeological , paleontological , and genetic data are inadequate to give much reliable information about such conjectured bottlenecks in 2000 , a molecular biology and evolution paper suggested a transplanting model or a 'long bottleneck ' to account for the limited genetic variation , rather than a catastrophic environmental change the population of american bison ( bison bison ) fell due to overhunting , nearly leading to extinction around the year 1890 , though it has since begun to recover ( see table ) left a classic example of a population bottleneck is that of the northern elephant seal , whose population fell to about 30 in the 1890s with so much of a colony 's offspring descended from just one dominant male , genetic diversity is limited , making the species more vulnerable to diseases and genetic mutations the bottlenecks likely caused the low genetic diversity observed in both species these declines in population were the result of hunting and habitat destruction , but the random consequences have also caused a great loss in species diversity the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck the low amount of polymorphic loci in the outplanted individuals led to the population bottleneck , causing the loss of the marker allele at eight of the loci

minimum viable population size in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size alternatively , invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago recent research shows the extent of climate change was much smaller than believed by proponents of the theory the population of american bison ( bison bison ) fell due to overhunting , nearly leading to extinction around the year 1890 , though it has since begun to recover ( see table ) an extreme example of a population bottleneck is the new zealand black robin , of which every specimen today is a descendant of a single female , called old blue the black robin population is still recovering from its low point of only five individuals in 1980 these declines in population were the result of hunting and habitat destruction , but the random consequences have also caused a great loss in species diversity selective breeding to produce high-yielding crops has caused genetic bottlenecks in these crops and has led to genetic homogeneity the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck the low amount of polymorphic loci in the outplanted individuals led to the population bottleneck , causing the loss of the marker allele at eight of the loci

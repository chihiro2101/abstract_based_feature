minimum viable population size in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size a slightly different form of bottleneck can occur if a small group becomes reproductively ( e.g geographically ) separated from the main population , such as through a founder event , e.g if a few members of a species successfully colonize a new isolated island , or from small captive breeding programs such as animals at a zoo alternatively , invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago this would be consistent with suggestions that in sub-saharan africa numbers could have dropped at times as low as 2,000 , for perhaps as long as 100,000 years , before numbers began to expand again in the late stone age left a classic example of a population bottleneck is that of the northern elephant seal , whose population fell to about 30 in the 1890s the black robin population is still recovering from its low point of only five individuals in 1980 the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck baby boom founder effect population boom small population size

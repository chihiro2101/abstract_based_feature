minimum viable population size in conservation biology , minimum viable population ( mvp ) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction the effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size a slightly different form of bottleneck can occur if a small group becomes reproductively ( e.g according to a 1999 model , a severe population bottleneck , or more specifically a full-fledged speciation , occurred among a group of australopithecine as they transitioned into the species known as homo erectus two million years ago recent research shows the extent of climate change was much smaller than believed by proponents of the theory in 2000 , a molecular biology and evolution paper suggested a transplanting model or a 'long bottleneck ' to account for the limited genetic variation , rather than a catastrophic environmental change left a classic example of a population bottleneck is that of the northern elephant seal , whose population fell to about 30 in the 1890s with so much of a colony 's offspring descended from just one dominant male , genetic diversity is limited , making the species more vulnerable to diseases and genetic mutations , dogs and cats : pugs , persian ) because breeders limit their gene pools by a few ( show-winning ) individuals for their looks and behaviors this reduced genetic diversity in many crops could lead to broader susceptibility to new diseases or pests , which threatens global food security the low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck baby boom founder effect population boom small population size

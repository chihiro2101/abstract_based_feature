image registration or image alignment algorithms can be classified into intensity-based and feature-based ardeshir goshtasby : 2-d and 3-d image registration for medical , remote sensing , and industrial applications , wiley press , 2005 one of the images is referred to as the moving or source and the others are referred to as the target , fixed or sensed images image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image the reference frame in the target image is stationary , while the other datasets are transformed to match to the target intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics , while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points , lines , and contours feature-based methods establish a correspondence between a number of especially distinct points in images knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images , a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images , thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space the first broad category of transformation models includes linear transformations , which include rotation , scaling , translation , and other affine transforms these transformations are capable of locally warping the target image to align with the reference image single-modality methods tend to register images in the same modality acquired by the same scanner/sensor type , while multi-modality registration methods tended to register images acquired by different scanner/sensor types multi-modality registration methods are often used in medical imaging as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners nonrigid registration of medical images can also be used to register a patient 's data to an anatomical atlas , such as the talairach atlas for neuroimaging this technique may also be used for images of different sizes , to allow images taken through different telescopes or lenses to be combined for low snr data , the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack

image registration or image alignment algorithms can be classified into intensity-based and feature-based ardeshir goshtasby : 2-d and 3-d image registration for medical , remote sensing , and industrial applications , wiley press , 2005 image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image the reference frame in the target image is stationary , while the other datasets are transformed to match to the target intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics , while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points , lines , and contours knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images , a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images , thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space these transformations are capable of locally warping the target image to align with the reference image alternatively , many advanced methods for spatial normalization are building on structure preserving transformations homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms since they carry smooth submanifolds smoothly during transformation spatial methods operate in the image domain , matching intensity patterns or features in images frequency-domain methods find the transformation parameters for registration of the images while working in the transform domain applying the phase correlation method to a pair of images produces a third image which contains a single peak multi-modality registration methods are often used in medical imaging as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners similarity measures for image registration mutual information and normalized mutual information are the most popular image similarity measures for registration of multimodality images for low snr data , the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack

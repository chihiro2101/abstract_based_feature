image registration or image alignment algorithms can be classified into intensity-based and feature-based ardeshir goshtasby : 2-d and 3-d image registration for medical , remote sensing , and industrial applications , wiley press , 2005 image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics , while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points , lines , and contours knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images , a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images , thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space linear transformations are global in nature , thus , they can not model local geometric differences between images spatial methods operate in the image domain , matching intensity patterns or features in images some of the feature matching algorithms are outgrowths of traditional techniques for performing manual image registration , in which an operator chooses corresponding control points ( cp ) in images affine ) for registration of the images the method can be extended to determine rotation and scaling differences between two images by first converting the images to log-polar coordinates zokai : robust image registration using log-polar transform â€¢ a paper on using the log polar transform for registration common examples of image similarity measures include cross-correlation , mutual information , sum of squared intensity differences , and ratio image uniformity several notable papers have attempted to quantify uncertainty in image registration in order to compare results due to the vast range of applications to which image registration can be applied , it is impossible to develop a general method that is optimized for all uses for low snr data , the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack

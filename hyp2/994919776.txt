image registration or image alignment algorithms can be classified into intensity-based and feature-based ardeshir goshtasby : 2-d and 3-d image registration for medical , remote sensing , and industrial applications , wiley press , 2005 one of the images is referred to as the moving or source and the others are referred to as the target , fixed or sensed images image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image the reference frame in the target image is stationary , while the other datasets are transformed to match to the target intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics , while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points , lines , and contours image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space these transformations are capable of locally warping the target image to align with the reference image some of the feature matching algorithms are outgrowths of traditional techniques for performing manual image registration , in which an operator chooses corresponding control points ( cp ) in images frequency-domain methods find the transformation parameters for registration of the images while working in the transform domain multi-modality registration methods are often used in medical imaging as images of a subject are frequently obtained from different scanners semi-automatic methods perform more of the registration steps automatically but depend on the user to verify the correctness of a registration cross-correlation , sum of squared intensity differences and ratio image uniformity are commonly used for registration of images in the same modality several notable papers have attempted to quantify uncertainty in image registration in order to compare results image registration has applications in remote sensing ( cartography updating ) , and computer vision for low snr data , the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack

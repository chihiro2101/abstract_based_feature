image registration or image alignment algorithms can be classified into intensity-based and feature-based ardeshir goshtasby : 2-d and 3-d image registration for medical , remote sensing , and industrial applications , wiley press , 2005 one of the images is referred to as the moving or source and the others are referred to as the target , fixed or sensed images image registration involves spatially transforming the source/moving image ( s ) to align with the target image intensity-based methods compare intensity patterns in images via correlation metrics , while feature-based methods find correspondence between image features such as points , lines , and contours if sub-images are registered , centers of corresponding sub images are treated as corresponding feature points knowing the correspondence between a number of points in images , a geometrical transformation is then determined to map the target image to the reference images , thereby establishing point-by-point correspondence between the reference and target images image registration algorithms can also be classified according to the transformation models they use to relate the target image space to the reference image space the first broad category of transformation models includes linear transformations , which include rotation , scaling , translation , and other affine transforms these transformations are capable of locally warping the target image to align with the reference image alternatively , many advanced methods for spatial normalization are building on structure preserving transformations homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms since they carry smooth submanifolds smoothly during transformation spatial methods operate in the image domain , matching intensity patterns or features in images common examples of image similarity measures include cross-correlation , mutual information , sum of squared intensity differences , and ratio image uniformity mutual information and normalized mutual information are the most popular image similarity measures for registration of multimodality images for low snr data , the best image registration is achieved by cross-correlating all permutations of images in an image stack image registration is an essential part of panoramic image creation

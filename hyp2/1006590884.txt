the bmw 132 was widely used , most notably on the junkers ju 52 , which it powered for much of that design 's lifetime in 1935 the rlm funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs , one from bramo , the bramo 329 , and another from bmw , the bmw 139 bmw 's design used many components from the bmw 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders , supplying 1,550 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,529 & nbsp ; hp , 1,140 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project radial engines were rare in european designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good streamlining and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft tank 's solution for the bmw 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized , flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front , blowing air past the engine cylinders , with some of it being drawn through s-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling however this system proved almost impossible to operate properly with the bmw 139 ; early prototypes of the fw 190 demonstrated terrible cooling problems the new design was given the name bmw 801 after bmw was given a new block of '' 109-800 '' engine numbers by the rlm to use after their merger with bramo the 801 retained the 139 's older-style single-valve intake and exhaust , while most in-line engines of the era had moved to either three ( as junkers had done ) or four valves per cylinder , or in british use for their own radials , sleeve valves several minor advances were worked into the design , including the use of sodium-cooled valves and a direct fuel injection system , manufactured by friedrich deckel ag of munich the kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles ' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in völkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to the bmw 801a/b engines delivered 1,560 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,539 & nbsp ; hp , 1,147 & nbsp ; kw ) for takeoff the bmw 801c was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling , including cooling '' gills '' on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots as with the 801b engine design , however , the 801h-2 engine did not leave the prototype stage with mw50 boosting turned on , takeoff power increased to 2,000 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,470 & nbsp ; kw ) , the c3-injection was initially only permitted for low altitude use and increased take-off power to 1870 ps the bmw 801e was a modification of the d-2 using different gear ratios , of 6:1 at low speed and 8.3:1 at high speed , that tuned the supercharger for higher altitudes 801j engine photo at flightglobal ( accessed march 11 , 2016 ) not many of these engines ever entered production due to high costs , and the various high-altitude designs based on them were forced to turn to other engines , typically the junkers jumo 213 the design of the bmw 801 's cowling was key to its proper cooling , which bmw designed and built themselves and supplied with the engine ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war technical drawing of a bmw 801a in high resolution technical drawing of a bmw 801d in high resolution first known post-restoration engine run of a bmw 801 in the 21st century

the bmw 132 was widely used , most notably on the junkers ju 52 , which it powered for much of that design 's lifetime in 1935 the rlm funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs , one from bramo , the bramo 329 , and another from bmw , the bmw 139 bmw 's design used many components from the bmw 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders , supplying 1,550 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,529 & nbsp ; hp , 1,140 & nbsp ; kw ) after bmw bought bramo in 1939 both projects were merged into the bmw 801 , learning from the problems encountered in both projects the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project radial engines were rare in european designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good streamlining and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft efforts to improve these designs led to new cowling designs that reduced the concerns about drag tank felt that attention to detail could result in a streamlined radial that would not suffer undue drag , and would be competitive with inlines tank 's solution for the bmw 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized , flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front , blowing air past the engine cylinders , with some of it being drawn through s-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling however this system proved almost impossible to operate properly with the bmw 139 ; early prototypes of the fw 190 demonstrated terrible cooling problems the new design was given the name bmw 801 after bmw was given a new block of '' 109-800 '' engine numbers by the rlm to use after their merger with bramo the kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles ' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in völkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to the bmw 801a/b engines delivered 1,560 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,539 & nbsp ; hp , 1,147 & nbsp ; kw ) for takeoff the bmw 801c was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling , including cooling '' gills '' on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots the 801c was replaced with the bmw 801 d-2 series engines in early 1942 , which ran on c2/c3 100 octane fuel instead of the a/b/c/l 's b4 87 octane , boosting takeoff power to 1,700 ps ( 1,677 & nbsp ; hp , 1,250 & nbsp ; kw ) with mw50 boosting turned on , takeoff power increased to 2,000 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,470 & nbsp ; kw ) , the c3-injection was initially only permitted for low altitude use and increased take-off power to 1870 ps the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match the design of the bmw 801 's cowling was key to its proper cooling , which bmw designed and built themselves and supplied with the engine ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war technical drawing of a bmw 801a in high resolution technical drawing of a bmw 801d in high resolution first known post-restoration engine run of a bmw 801 in the 21st century

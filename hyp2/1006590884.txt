in 1935 the rlm funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs , one from bramo , the bramo 329 , and another from bmw , the bmw 139 bmw 's design used many components from the bmw 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders , supplying 1,550 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,529 & nbsp ; hp , 1,140 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project radial engines were rare in european designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good streamlining and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft tank felt that attention to detail could result in a streamlined radial that would not suffer undue drag , and would be competitive with inlines tank 's solution for the bmw 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized , flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front , blowing air past the engine cylinders , with some of it being drawn through s-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling the new design was given the name bmw 801 after bmw was given a new block of '' 109-800 '' engine numbers by the rlm to use after their merger with bramo the supercharger was rather basic in the early models , using a single-stage two-speed design directly geared to the engine ( unlike the db 601 's hydraulically clutched version ) which led to rather limited altitude performance , in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage the kommandoger√§t could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles ' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries 29 the 801b was to be identical to the 801a except turning a '' left-handed '' airscrew , rotating in the opposite direction ( counterclockwise , as seen from behind the engine ) using a different gearbox the a and b models were intended to be used in pairs on twin-engine designs , cancelling out net torque and making the plane easier to handle the bmw 801a/b engines delivered 1,560 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,539 & nbsp ; hp , 1,147 & nbsp ; kw ) for takeoff the bmw 801g-2 and h-2 models were d-2 engines modified for use in bomber roles with lower gear ratios for driving larger propellers , clockwise and counterclockwise respectively as with the 801b engine design , however , the 801h-2 engine did not leave the prototype stage with mw50 boosting turned on , takeoff power increased to 2,000 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,470 & nbsp ; kw ) , the c3-injection was initially only permitted for low altitude use and increased take-off power to 1870 ps later c3-injection systems were permitted for low-to-medium altitude use and raised take-off power to more than 1900 ps a sizable number of bmw 801s exist in museums , some on display by themselves , with some 20 of them associated with list of surviving focke-wulf fw 190s that they powered in world war ii the design of the bmw 801 's cowling was key to its proper cooling , which bmw designed and built themselves and supplied with the engine this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft the m and t unitized engine formats added secondary designator suffixes , which especially for the 801 radial ( and perhaps others ) , did not always match the letter suffix that designated the bare radial engine used for a particular unitized installation , confusing the naming of the 801 engine series ' subtypes considerably ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war

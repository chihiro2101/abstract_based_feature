the bmw 132 was widely used , most notably on the junkers ju 52 , which it powered for much of that design 's lifetime in 1935 the rlm funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs , one from bramo , the bramo 329 , and another from bmw , the bmw 139 bmw 's design used many components from the bmw 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders , supplying 1,550 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,529 & nbsp ; hp , 1,140 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project tank felt that attention to detail could result in a streamlined radial that would not suffer undue drag , and would be competitive with inlines tank 's solution for the bmw 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized , flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front , blowing air past the engine cylinders , with some of it being drawn through s-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling although the problems appeared to be fixable , since the engine was already fairly dated in terms of design , in 1938 bmw proposed an entirely new engine designed specifically for fan-cooling that could be brought to production quickly the new design was given the name bmw 801 after bmw was given a new block of '' 109-800 '' engine numbers by the rlm to use after their merger with bramo there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in v√∂lkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to it also maximized the use of positive air pressure to aid cooling of cylinders , heads , and other internal parts 29 the 801b was to be identical to the 801a except turning a '' left-handed '' airscrew , rotating in the opposite direction ( counterclockwise , as seen from behind the engine ) using a different gearbox the bmw 801a/b engines delivered 1,560 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,539 & nbsp ; hp , 1,147 & nbsp ; kw ) for takeoff the bmw 801c was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling , including cooling '' gills '' on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots the bmw 801l was an a model with the hydraulic prop control mechanism introduced with the 801c engine the 801c was replaced with the bmw 801 d-2 series engines in early 1942 , which ran on c2/c3 100 octane fuel instead of the a/b/c/l 's b4 87 octane , boosting takeoff power to 1,700 ps ( 1,677 & nbsp ; hp , 1,250 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 801g-2 and h-2 models were d-2 engines modified for use in bomber roles with lower gear ratios for driving larger propellers , clockwise and counterclockwise respectively bruno bruckmann , head of bmw 's piston and jet engine development departments , and learned that the priorities for the trio of aforementioned bmw radial engines was : firstly , the 801 was to be developed '' up to its limits '' , with the 802 's design completion and prototype construction as a secondary issue , with the complex 803 four-row radial only receiving attention to its design-development the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war technical drawing of a bmw 801a in high resolution technical drawing of a bmw 801d in high resolution first known post-restoration engine run of a bmw 801 in the 21st century

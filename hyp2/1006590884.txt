the bmw 132 was widely used , most notably on the junkers ju 52 , which it powered for much of that design 's lifetime in 1935 the rlm funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs , one from bramo , the bramo 329 , and another from bmw , the bmw 139 bmw 's design used many components from the bmw 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders , supplying 1,550 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,529 & nbsp ; hp , 1,140 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project radial engines were rare in european designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good streamlining and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft tank 's solution for the bmw 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized , flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front , blowing air past the engine cylinders , with some of it being drawn through s-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling although the problems appeared to be fixable , since the engine was already fairly dated in terms of design , in 1938 bmw proposed an entirely new engine designed specifically for fan-cooling that could be brought to production quickly the new design was given the name bmw 801 after bmw was given a new block of '' 109-800 '' engine numbers by the rlm to use after their merger with bramo the supercharger was rather basic in the early models , using a single-stage two-speed design directly geared to the engine ( unlike the db 601 's hydraulically clutched version ) which led to rather limited altitude performance , in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage one key advancement for the 801 was the aforementioned kommandogerät ( command-device ) , a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow , propeller pitch , supercharger setting , mixture and ignition timing in response to a single throttle lever , dramatically simplifying engine control there was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and bmw-designed forward cowling ( incorporating the engine 's oil cooler ) at the luftfahrtforschungsanstalt ( lfa ) facility in völkenrode , leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to the a and b models were intended to be used in pairs on twin-engine designs , cancelling out net torque and making the plane easier to handle the bmw 801a/b engines delivered 1,560 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,539 & nbsp ; hp , 1,147 & nbsp ; kw ) for takeoff the bmw 801c was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling , including cooling '' gills '' on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots the bmw 801l was an a model with the hydraulic prop control mechanism introduced with the 801c engine as with the 801b engine design , however , the 801h-2 engine did not leave the prototype stage the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match the turbocharger was fitted behind the engine at a 30° forward tilt off a vertical axis , possessed hollow turbine blades in the exhaust section , and in a photo from flight magazine , appears to have intercooler units fitted around the inner circumference of the rear cowl , just behind the rear row of cylinders sheffield p.169 air from the fan was blown into the center of the engine in front of the propeller gearing housing , and the shape of the housing and the engine itself carried the air to the outside of the cowling and across the cylinders this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft the m and t unitized engine formats added secondary designator suffixes , which especially for the 801 radial ( and perhaps others ) , did not always match the letter suffix that designated the bare radial engine used for a particular unitized installation , confusing the naming of the 801 engine series ' subtypes considerably

in the 1930s , bmw took out a license to build the pratt & whitney hornet engines the bmw 132 was widely used , most notably on the junkers ju 52 , which it powered for much of that design 's lifetime in 1935 the rlm funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs , one from bramo , the bramo 329 , and another from bmw , the bmw 139 bmw 's design used many components from the bmw 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders , supplying 1,550 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,529 & nbsp ; hp , 1,140 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other german radials , namely bombers and transport aircraft , but midway through the program the focke-wulf firm 's chief designer , kurt tank suggested it for use in the focke-wulf fw 190 fighter project radial engines were rare in european designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good streamlining and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft the main concern was providing cooling air over the cylinder heads , which generally required a very large opening at the front of the aircraft tank 's solution for the bmw 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized , flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front , blowing air past the engine cylinders , with some of it being drawn through s-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling although the problems appeared to be fixable , since the engine was already fairly dated in terms of design , in 1938 bmw proposed an entirely new engine designed specifically for fan-cooling that could be brought to production quickly the new design was given the name bmw 801 after bmw was given a new block of '' 109-800 '' engine numbers by the rlm to use after their merger with bramo one key advancement for the 801 was the aforementioned kommandogerät ( command-device ) , a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow , propeller pitch , supercharger setting , mixture and ignition timing in response to a single throttle lever , dramatically simplifying engine control the kommandogerät could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles ' internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries 29 the 801b was to be identical to the 801a except turning a '' left-handed '' airscrew , rotating in the opposite direction ( counterclockwise , as seen from behind the engine ) using a different gearbox the bmw 801a/b engines delivered 1,560 & nbsp ; ps ( 1,539 & nbsp ; hp , 1,147 & nbsp ; kw ) for takeoff the bmw 801l was an a model with the hydraulic prop control mechanism introduced with the 801c engine although takeoff power was unaffected , cruise power increased over 100 & nbsp ; hp ( 75 & nbsp ; kw ) and '' high power '' modes for climb at nearly 1,500 to 1,650 ps ; and combat were likewise improved by up to 150 & nbsp ; hp ( 110 & nbsp ; kw ) the bmw 801e was likewise modified to create the bmw 801q , delivering a superb 1,715 & nbsp ; hp ( 1,261 & nbsp ; kw ) at , power ratings no existing allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match likewise , the ju 88r-1 night fighter at the royal air force museum london ( see photo above ) also has unitized bmw 801 radials installed one was to eliminate any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding oil cooler would produce , in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine 's forward cowling this factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely '' unitizing '' a bmw 801 radial engine , with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself , as opposed to opening or removing a '' separate '' cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft ; bmw 801 a , c , l ( b ) :1,560 ps ( 1,539 hp , 1,147 kw ) ; bmw 801 d-2 , q-2 , g-2 , ( h-2 ) :1,700 ps ( 1,677 hp , 1,250 kw ) ; bmw 801 e , s :2,000 ps ( 1,973 hp , 1,471 kw ) ; bmw 801 f :2,400 ps ( 2,367 hp , 1,765 kw ) , development halted by the end of the war

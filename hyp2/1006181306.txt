the magellanic clouds have been known since ancient times by indigenous people from south america and africa , and from the first millennium in western asia the first preserved mention of the large magellanic clouds is believed to be in petroglyphs and rock drawings found in chile in sri lanka , from ancient times , these clouds have been referred to as the maha mera paruwathaya meaning '' the great mountain '' , as they look like the peaks of a distant mountain range in europe , the clouds were first reported by 16th century italian authors peter martyr d'anghiera and andrea corsali , both based on portuguese voyages '' ( the portuguese reached beyond the 55th degree of the other pole , where one may observe certain nebulae revolving around the point i.e that is , nebulae appear in or beside the milky way throughout its entire length in the southern sky the relevant part of corsali 's letter ( translated by eden ) appears in : richard eden , with edward arber , ed , the first three english books on america … ( birmingham , england : 1885 ) , '' of the pole antarike and the starres abowt the same … '' , p the large magellanic cloud and its neighbour and relative , the small magellanic cloud , are conspicuous objects in the southern hemisphere , looking like separated pieces of the milky way to the naked eye until the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy in 1994 , they were the closest known galaxies to our own ( since 2003 , the canis major dwarf galaxy was discovered to be closer still , and is now considered the actual nearest neighbor ) only a fraction of their gas seems to have coalesced into stars and they probably both have large dark matter halos astronomers have long assumed that the magellanic clouds have orbited the milky way at approximately their current distances , but evidence suggests that it is rare for them to come as close to the milky way as they are now observation and theoretical evidence suggest that the magellanic clouds have both been greatly distorted by tidal interaction with the milky way as they travel close to it the star cluster has a low metallicity and belongs to the leading arm of the magellanic clouds the existence of this star cluster suggests that the leading arm of the magellanic clouds is 90,000 light-years away from the milky way—closer than previously thought visvanathan proposed that the smc may in fact be split in two , with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the smc ( as seen from earth 's perspective ) , and separated by about 30,000 light years

the magellanic clouds have been known since ancient times by indigenous people from south america and africa , and from the first millennium in western asia the first preserved mention of the large magellanic clouds is believed to be in petroglyphs and rock drawings found in chile in europe , the clouds were first reported by 16th century italian authors peter martyr d'anghiera and andrea corsali , both based on portuguese voyages '' ( the portuguese reached beyond the 55th degree of the other pole , where one may observe certain nebulae revolving around the point i.e , the southern celestial pole , scattered in the milky way like luminous patches throughout the whole sphere of the sky , within the breadth of its extent that is , nebulae appear in or beside the milky way throughout its entire length in the southern sky for further details of – and other editions of – peter martyr d'anghiera 's book de orbe novo , see wikipedia 's article : decades of the new world from 1515 to 1517 , andrea corsali sailed to the east indies and china in a portuguese ship in 1516 , andrea corsali sent a letter to giuliano de ' medici , duke of nemours , mentioning the magellanic clouds the relevant part of corsali 's letter ( translated by eden ) appears in : richard eden , with edward arber , ed ( new york , new york : springer science + business media , 2012 ) , § 4.3.2.2 andreas corsali , p 66 : '' the antarctic pole is not so covered with stars as the arctic , for there are to be seen there many small stars congregated together , which are like to two clouds a little separated from one another , and a little dimmed , the large magellanic cloud and its neighbour and relative , the small magellanic cloud , are conspicuous objects in the southern hemisphere , looking like separated pieces of the milky way to the naked eye astronomers have long assumed that the magellanic clouds have orbited the milky way at approximately their current distances , but evidence suggests that it is rare for them to come as close to the milky way as they are now home.insightbb.com retrieved on 2007-05-31 they are also more metal-poor than the milky way ; the youngest stars in the lmc and smc have a metallicity of 0.5 and 0.25 times solar , respectively measurements with the hubble space telescope , announced in 2006 , suggest the magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be long term companions of the milky way they are possibly on a first approach and we are witnessing the start of a galactic merger that may overlap with the milky way 's expected merger with the andromeda galaxy ( and perhaps the triangulum galaxy ) in the future

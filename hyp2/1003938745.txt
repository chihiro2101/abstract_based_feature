in his introduction to the science of hadith , ibn al-salah , a renowned hadith specialist , explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators introducing the chapter entitled , 'recognizing the trustworthy , reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable , ' ibn al-salah said , '' this is from the most distinguished and noble types ( of hadith study ) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness he then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the '' maintenance of the shariah , purging it of any mistakes or misinformation '' stressing the importance of biographical evaluation , ali ibn al-madini , an early authority on the subject , said , '' knowing the narrators is half of knowledge while many sahaba narrated hadith , according to ahmad ibn hanbal there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them , who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent they were : abu huraira , abdullah ibn umar , aisha , jabir ibn abdullah , ibn abbas and anas ibn malik with abu huraira being the most prolific of them muqadimah ibn al-salah , by ibn al-salah , edited by 'aishah bint 'abd al-rahman , p according to ibn al-salah the most prolific narrators from the sahaba was abu huraira followed by ibn abbas in spite of the companions ' efforts in narrating their hadith , there was no need for them to evaluate each other 's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness this is because , as al-khatib al-baghdadi said , that allah and his prophet declared the sahaba to be upright and trustworthy , and , therefore , there is no need to investigate their reliability , however , one must investigate the condition of those after them al-bulqini added some names to the aforementioned : ali ibn al-madini and 'amr ibn 'ali al-fallas , and then mentioned malik ibn anas and hisham ibn urwah as having preceded them in evaluating narrators the first relates to the continuity of the hadith 's chain of narration ; if there is discontinuity between two or more narrators , that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the hadith terminology article the second relates to criticism of a narrator , or more , in the chain of narration of a particular hadith 108 , dar ibn al-jawzi , dammam , saudi arabia , sixth edition , 2001 hadith narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith contradiction of that narrator 's hadith of another established narrator so , perhaps , the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates , for example , claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability , comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator , in particular , while contradicting the others this is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process a system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator , with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators trustworthy and worthy of trust are both examples of the next category to ibn abi hatim and ibn al-salah while al-'iraqi and al-dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level the least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is soft in hadith ( layyin al-ḥadīth ) and , according to al-'iraqi , they have spoken about him ( takallamū fīhi ) ibn hajar al-asqalani works by ibn ḥajr al-kamal fi asma ' al-rijal , by abd al-ghani al-maqdisi , is a collection of the biographies of the narrators of the hadith contained in the six major hadith collections

felt from wool is considered to be the oldest known textile sumerian legend claims that the secret of feltmaking was discovered by urnamman of lagash the story of saint clement and saint christopher relates that the men packed their sandals with wool to prevent blisters while fleeing from persecution siberian tombs ( 7th to 2nd century bc ) show the broad uses of felt in that culture , including clothing , jewelry , wall hangings , and elaborate horse blankets sheep and camel herds were central to the wealth and lifestyle of these tribes , both of which were critical to producing the fibers needed for felting as nomads travelling frequently and living on fairly treeless plains , felt provided housing ( yurts , tents , etc in nomadic peoples , an area where feltmaking was particularly visible was in trappings for their animals and for travel feltmaking is still practised by nomadic peoples ( such as mongols and turkic people ) in central asia , where rugs , tents and clothing are regularly made in the western world , felt is widely used as a medium for expression in both textile art and contemporary art and design , where it has significance as an ecologically responsible textile and building material thumb in the wet felting process , hot water is applied to layers of animal hairs , while repeated agitation and compression causes the fibers to hook together or weave together into a single piece of fabric there is an alternative theory that the fibers wind around each other during felting plant fibers and synthetic fibers will not wet felt in order to strengthen the joints of a mosaic style felt , feltmakers often add a backing layer of fleece that is felted along with the other components in central asia , it is common to conduct the rolling/friction process with the aid of a horse , donkey , or camel , which will pull the rolled felt until the process is complete alternately , a group of people in a line might roll the felt along , kicking it regularly with their feet amateur or community felting obviously continued in many communities at the same time that felting specialists and felting centers began to develop however , the importance of felting to community life can be seen in the fact that , in many central asian communities , felt production , is directed by a leader who oversees the process as a ritual that includes prayersâ€”words and actions to bring good luck to the process the special needles used to make 3d sculpture , jewelry , adornments and 2d art have notches along the shaft of the needle that catch fibers and tangle them with other fibers to produce felt similar to a sewing machine , these tools have several needles that punch fibers together as the user pushes fibers through in a manner very similar to feeding a sewing machine felt is frequently used in industry as a sound or vibration damper , as a non-woven fabric for air filtration , and in machinery for cushioning and padding moving parts felt is used extensively in pianos ; for example , piano hammers are made of wool felt around a wooden core modern day felters with access to a broad range of sheep and other animal fibers have exploited knowledge of these different breeds to produce special effects in their felt exploitation of these characteristics of the fleece in tandem with the use of other techniques , such as stitching and incorporation of other fibers , provides felters with a broad range of possibilities

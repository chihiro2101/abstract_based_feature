greek and latin intellectuals as well as the modistae have contributed to the different perspectives of interjections in language throughout history the greeks held that interjections fell into the grammatical category of adverbs they thought interjections modified the verb much in the same way as adverbs do , thus interjections were closely connected to verbs unlike their greek counterparts , many latin scholars took the position that interjections did not rely on verbs and were used to communicate emotions and abstract ideas some , such as thomas of erfurt , agreed with the former greeks that the interjection was closely tied to the verb while others like siger of courtrai held that the interjection was its own part of speech syntactically , much like the latin scholars in contrast to typical words and sentences , the function of most interjections is related to an expression of feeling , rather than representing some idea or concept emotion review , 6 ( 1 ) , 53-63 generally , interjections can be classified into three types of meaning : volitive , emotive , or cognitive cognitive interjections express feelings which are more related to cognition , or information known to the speaker of the utterance ( e.g while there exists some apparent overlap between emotive and cognitive interjections , as both express a feeling , cognitive interjections can be seen as more related to knowledge of something ( i.e , ouch ! , huh ? ) , while secondary interjections are words from other categories that come to be used as interjections in virtue of their meaning ( examples : damn ! , hell ! ) primary interjections are generally considered to be single words ( oh ! , wow ! ) although secondary interjections tend to interact more with the words around them , a characteristic of all interjections—whether primary or secondary—is that they can stand alone exclamations and curses are primarily about giving expression to private feelings or emotions , while response particles and hesitation markers are primarily directed at managing the flow of social interaction similarly , the interjection '' ouch ! '' generally expresses pain , but also requires contextual information for the listener to determine the referent of the expression ( i.e for instance , interjections like ' brr ' and ' shh ! ' are made entirely of consonants , where in virtually all languages , words have to feature at least one vowel-like element aizuchi discourse marker filler ( linguistics ) list of interjections by language at wiktionary english interjections at wiktionary : category : interjections words without vowels

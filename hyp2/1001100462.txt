greek and latin intellectuals as well as the modistae have contributed to the different perspectives of interjections in language throughout history the greeks held that interjections fell into the grammatical category of adverbs they thought interjections modified the verb much in the same way as adverbs do , thus interjections were closely connected to verbs unlike their greek counterparts , many latin scholars took the position that interjections did not rely on verbs and were used to communicate emotions and abstract ideas further , the latin grammarians classified any small non-word utterances as interjections several hundred years later , the 13th- and 14th-century modistae took inconsistent approaches to interjections some , such as thomas of erfurt , agreed with the former greeks that the interjection was closely tied to the verb while others like siger of courtrai held that the interjection was its own part of speech syntactically , much like the latin scholars in contrast to typical words and sentences , the function of most interjections is related to an expression of feeling , rather than representing some idea or concept while there exists some apparent overlap between emotive and cognitive interjections , as both express a feeling , cognitive interjections can be seen as more related to knowledge of something ( i.e , ouch ! , huh ? ) , while secondary interjections are words from other categories that come to be used as interjections in virtue of their meaning ( examples : damn ! , hell ! ) primary interjections are generally considered to be single words ( oh ! , wow ! ) exclamations and curses are primarily about giving expression to private feelings or emotions , while response particles and hesitation markers are primarily directed at managing the flow of social interaction a key difference between interjections and onomatopoeia is that interjections are typically responses to events , while onomatopoeia can be seen as imitations of events under a different use of the term 'particle ' , particles and interjections can be distinctions in that particles can not be independent utterances and are fully a part of the syntax of the utterance similar observations have been made for the interjections oh ! ' ( meaning , roughly , '' now i see '' ) and ' mm/m-hm ' ( with the meaning '' keep talking , i 'm with you '' ) aizuchi discourse marker filler ( linguistics ) list of interjections by language at wiktionary english interjections at wiktionary : category : interjections words without vowels

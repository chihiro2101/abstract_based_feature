'' you know , the christian religion has this symbol , it has a bunch of beliefs when it first came out , we all liked it , you know ? we were little kids and we thought 'yeah , this is a great idea , it 'll piss people off ' you know , when you 're fifteen years-old , the first thing you think about is 'how can i piss people off ? ' , you know ? and it 's very good to it 's very easy to piss people off when you 're fifteen , especially it 's easy to piss off your parents and adults , in general it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it 's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and , so , it became , maybe , bigger than what it really was in the beginning

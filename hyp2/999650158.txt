kerry packer and the australian television industry since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions agitation for more australian-made programming gained impetus from the '' tv : make it australian '' campaign in 1970 the advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and , importantly , australian sport counted as local content the correlation between sports , corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to australian sports administrators at the time with nine 's ratings languishing , packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament packer was a fan of cricket , which was undergoing a resurgence in popularity during the mid-1970s the acb felt loyal to the abc , which had broadcast the game for twenty years when the commercial networks showed little interest in the game the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world for the first time , the game 's officialdom had a demonstration of packer 's wherewithal : he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract in early 1977 , he began contracting a list of australian players provided by recently retired australian test captain ian chappell a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer news of the wsc plans were inadvertently leaked to australian journalists , who broke the story on 9 may it seemed certain that all packer players would be banned from test and first class cricket in light of the controversies the sydney gazette article clearly showed west indian captain clive lloyd interviewed after leaving the caribbean team to join packer , lloyd stated it was nothing personal it was clearly earning a more comfortable source of income he appeared on david frost 's the frost programme to debate his concept with commentators jim laker and robin marlar the show significantly raised packer 's profile and converted some to his way of thinking benaud 's standing in the game and his journalistic background helped steer packer through the politics of the game cricket 's world governing body , the international cricket conference ( icc ) , now entered a controversy initially perceived as an australian domestic problem after ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground , packer demanded that the icc award him the exclusive australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended and packer stormed from the meeting to deliver the following unadulterated declaration of war : haigh ( 1993 ) , p 76 had i got those tv rights i was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board it 's every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost this outburst undid any goodwill that packer had created during his earlier television appearance , and alarmed his contracted players , who had viewed his scheme as being as much philanthropic as commercial packer 's lawyers stated that the icc had tried to force the packer players to break their contracts and to prevent others from joining them are the contracts between wsc and its players void ? has wsc established that , as at 3 august , and subject to any statutory immunity conferred by the 1974 act , the trade union and labour relations act 1974 , repealed and replaced by the trade union and labour relations ( consolidation ) act 1992 players could not be criticized for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by wsc left official cricket won a series of minor victories – packer was unable to use the terms '' test match '' or call their team of australians '' australia '' , or use the official rules of cricket , which are the copyright of the marylebone cricket club by common consensus , it was considered impossible to create the pitches in such a short time after wsc concluded , maley was the curator of the waca ground in perth from 1980–88 another unexpected element of the series was the emergence of a west indian side the concept was originally envisaged as australia versus the rest of the world however , wsc used the west indian players in the world team as well the official test match played in brisbane at the same time , featuring the weakened australian team and india , attracted far more spectators to counteract the continual rotation of pace bowlers on pitches of unproven quality , wsc batsmen felt the need to increase their bodily protection in the sydney supertest on 16 december , australian david hookes was hit a sickening blow from a bouncer bowled by west indian andy roberts paradoxically , the effect of hookes ' broken jaw , captured graphically by nine 's cameras , served to '' legitimise '' the wsc matches : many took a lead from the hostile press , and official cricket benefited from a dramatic test series played between australia and a touring indian team the acb 's masterstroke was the appointment of the 41-year-old bobby simpson as australian captain , after a ten-year retirement from first-class cricket by contrast , packer was seen disconsolately counting cars as they arrived in the car park at some of his matches for the 1979–80 season , greg chappell was restored as australian captain and the team contained an even mixture of wsc and non-wsc players foreword by richie benaud golden press ( 1979 ) : '' cricket alight ! world series cricket , in australia , new zealand and the west indies '' , macarthur press

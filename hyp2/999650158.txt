kerry packer and the australian television industry since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions agitation for more australian-made programming gained impetus from the '' tv : make it australian '' campaign in 1970 the advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and , importantly , australian sport counted as local content with nine 's ratings languishing , packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire packer believed that there was an '' old-boy network '' element to the decision , mcfarline ( 1977 ) , p 157 the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world his mistrust of cricket 's administrators deepened when the acb recommended the tccb accept an offer for their broadcasts rights from the abc , even though abc 's 210,000 offer was only 14 % of the offer from packer for the first time , the game 's officialdom had a demonstration of packer 's wherewithal : he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world by the time the season climaxed with the centenary test match between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground in march 1977 , about two dozen players had committed to packer 's enterprise , which as yet had no grounds to play on , no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert immediately , all hell broke loose in the hitherto conservative world of cricket greig retained his position in the team , but was stripped of the captaincy and ostracised by everyone in the cricket establishment , most of whom had been singing his praises just weeks before it seemed certain that all packer players would be banned from test and first class cricket the australian players were a divided group and the management made their displeasure clear to the packer signees in light of the controversies the sydney gazette article clearly showed west indian captain clive lloyd interviewed after leaving the caribbean team to join packer , lloyd stated it was nothing personal it was clearly earning a more comfortable source of income that interview created waves across the caribbean and even in world cricket a largely unknown kerry packer arrived in london in late may 1977 cricket 's world governing body , the international cricket conference ( icc ) , now entered a controversy initially perceived as an australian domestic problem they met with packer , benaud and two assistants at lord 's on 23 june to discuss the wsc plans after ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground , packer demanded that the icc award him the exclusive australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended packer moved quickly to shore up support , meeting with the players and taking legal action to prevent third parties from inducing players to break their contracts to clarify the legal implications ( including the proposed bans ) , packer backed a challenge to the tccb in the high court by three of his players : tony greig , mike procter and john snow players could not be criticized for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by wsc the decision was a blow to the cricket authorities and , adding insult to injury , they had to pay court costs english county cricket teams were pleased as their players who had signed to play for packer were still eligible to play for them '' supertests '' , the west indies and drop-in pitches so the five-day matches became '' supertests '' , played by the '' wsc australian xi '' and richie benaud set to work writing rules and playing conditions for the series after wsc concluded , maley was the curator of the waca ground in perth from 1980–88 however , wsc used the west indian players in the world team as well the first wsc game , a supertest '' between the australians and the west indians began at vfl park on 2 december 1977 the official test match played in brisbane at the same time , featuring the weakened australian team and india , attracted far more spectators to counteract the continual rotation of pace bowlers on pitches of unproven quality , wsc batsmen felt the need to increase their bodily protection in the sydney supertest on 16 december , australian david hookes was hit a sickening blow from a bouncer bowled by west indian andy roberts paradoxically , the effect of hookes ' broken jaw , captured graphically by nine 's cameras , served to '' legitimise '' the wsc matches : protective cricket equipment developed rapidly , and by the end of wsc , australia innovates project the non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of clive lloyd as captain , and all of the wsc contracted west indian players to declare themselves unavailable for the rest of the series these matches brought cricket to venues that rarely saw big games wsc then headed to the caribbean for a tense , hard fought series that players from both australia and west indies declared the best they ever played in not only had nine network won the exclusive rights to telecast australian cricket , it was granted a ten-year contract to promote and market the game through a new company , pbl marketing all of these techniques pioneered by world series cricket have become a staple of the way the game is now marketed in australia foreword by richie benaud golden press ( 1979 ) : '' cricket alight ! world series cricket , in australia , new zealand and the west indies '' , macarthur press

kerry packer and the australian television industry in the mid-1970s , the australian television industry was at a crossroads since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions agitation for more australian-made programming gained impetus from the '' tv : make it australian '' campaign in 1970 the advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and , importantly , australian sport counted as local content the correlation between sports , corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to australian sports administrators at the time after the death of his father sir frank in 1974 , kerry packer had assumed control of nine network , one of the many media interests owned by the family 's company consolidated press holdings ( cph ) with nine 's ratings languishing , packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament packer was a fan of cricket , which was undergoing a resurgence in popularity during the mid-1970s in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire the acb felt loyal to the abc , which had broadcast the game for twenty years when the commercial networks showed little interest in the game packer believed that there was an '' old-boy network '' element to the decision , mcfarline ( 1977 ) , p 157 and he was furious at the dismissive way that his bid was handled the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world haigh ( 1993 ) , p 41 for the first time , the game 's officialdom had a demonstration of packer 's wherewithal : he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract in early 1977 , he began contracting a list of australian players provided by recently retired australian test captain ian chappell a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer not unexpectedly , the english were critical of what they quickly dubbed the '' packer circus '' and reserved particular vitriol for the english captain tony greig , for his central role in organising the break-away it seemed certain that all packer players would be banned from test and first class cricket the australian players were a divided group and the management made their displeasure clear to the packer signees that interview created waves across the caribbean and even in world cricket he appeared on david frost 's the frost programme to debate his concept with commentators jim laker and robin marlar marlar 's aggressive , indignant interrogation of packer came unstuck when packer proved to be articulate , witty and confident that his vision was the way of the future cricket 's world governing body , the international cricket conference ( icc ) , now entered a controversy initially perceived as an australian domestic problem mcfarline ( 1977 ) , p56 after ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground , packer demanded that the icc award him the exclusive australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended and packer stormed from the meeting to deliver the following unadulterated declaration of war : haigh ( 1993 ) , p 76 had i got those tv rights i was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board this outburst undid any goodwill that packer had created during his earlier television appearance , and alarmed his contracted players , who had viewed his scheme as being as much philanthropic as commercial the icc was not a defendant in the case as it had no legal personality at the time see : the uk statute law database , ministry of justice the decision was a blow to the cricket authorities and , adding insult to injury , they had to pay court costs english county cricket teams were pleased as their players who had signed to play for packer were still eligible to play for them the obvious problem was preparing grass pitches of suitable standard at these venues , where none had existed previously these pitches were grown in hothouses outside the venue , then dropped into the playing surface with cranes the first wsc game , a supertest '' between the australians and the west indians began at vfl park on 2 december 1977 a near-capacity crowd of 44,377 turned out to watch the limited overs cricket , serving a warning to the acb not only had nine network won the exclusive rights to telecast australian cricket , it was granted a ten-year contract to promote and market the game through a new company , pbl marketing colored dress , protective helmets , field restrictions , cricket under lights , became a standard part of the post-packer game austin robertson when he was promoting his book cricket outlaws stated how much the directors were paid for world series cricket gideon haigh (

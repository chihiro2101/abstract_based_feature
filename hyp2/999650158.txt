kerry packer and the australian television industry since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions the advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and , importantly , australian sport counted as local content the correlation between sports , corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to australian sports administrators at the time with nine 's ratings languishing , packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming firstly , he secured the rights to the australian open ( golf ) he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament packer was a fan of cricket , which was undergoing a resurgence in popularity during the mid-1970s in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire he approached the acb with an offer of a 1.5 million for three years ( eight times the previous contract ) , yet he was rebuffed determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson robertson managed several high-profile australian cricketers such as dennis lillee packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world his mistrust of cricket 's administrators deepened when the acb recommended the tccb accept an offer for their broadcasts rights from the abc , even though abc 's 210,000 offer was only 14 % of the offer from packer for the first time , the game 's officialdom had a demonstration of packer 's wherewithal : he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract in early 1977 , he began contracting a list of australian players provided by recently retired australian test captain ian chappell it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer news of the wsc plans were inadvertently leaked to australian journalists , who broke the story on 9 may immediately , all hell broke loose in the hitherto conservative world of cricket not unexpectedly , the english were critical of what they quickly dubbed the '' packer circus '' and reserved particular vitriol for the english captain tony greig , for his central role in organising the break-away it seemed certain that all packer players would be banned from test and first class cricket marlar 's aggressive , indignant interrogation of packer came unstuck when packer proved to be articulate , witty and confident that his vision was the way of the future they met with packer , benaud and two assistants at lord 's on 23 june to discuss the wsc plans had i got those tv rights i was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board the cricket authority 's counsel said that if the top players deserted traditional cricket then gate receipts would decline players could not be criticized for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by wsc so the five-day matches became '' supertests '' , played by the '' wsc australian xi '' and richie benaud set to work writing rules and playing conditions for the series after wsc concluded , maley was the curator of the waca ground in perth from 1980–88 the concept was originally envisaged as australia versus the rest of the world however , wsc used the west indian players in the world team as well the first wsc game , a supertest '' between the australians and the west indians began at vfl park on 2 december 1977 the official test match played in brisbane at the same time , featuring the weakened australian team and india , attracted far more spectators first season : 1977–78 to counteract the continual rotation of pace bowlers on pitches of unproven quality , wsc batsmen felt the need to increase their bodily protection until that moment , wsc had looked suspiciously like a thrown-together entertainment package ; hookes ' injury impressed the contest 's intensity on all observers virtually all batsmen in wsc and official test matches were sporting some form of protective headwear a one-day series , the '' international cup '' featuring the australian , west indian and world teams , was played alongside six supertests in sydney , melbourne , adelaide and perth he led a team of relatively unknown youngsters ( with the exception of fast bowler jeff thomson , who did not sign up for the wsc ) to a 3–2 series victory which was not decided until the final test in adelaide the best attended matches had been the day-night fixtures , and this format would become the backbone of the programming for the second season now he had no objection to wsc making a brief tour of his country in november , nor was he going to stop the kiwis ' best player , his son richard , from appearing with wsc some were prepared to acclaim south africa as the best side of the world on the basis of the performances of some of their players in wsc the supertest final at the scg between australian and the world teams , played under lights , drew almost 40,000 spectators over three days not only had nine network won the exclusive rights to telecast australian cricket , it was granted a ten-year contract to promote and market the game through a new company , pbl marketing now , when it suited australia , they had brushed their friends aside to meet their own ends kerry packer described his involvement in world series cricket as '' half-philanthropic '' foreword by richie benaud golden press ( 1979 ) : '' cricket alight ! world series cricket , in australia , new zealand and the west indies '' , macarthur press

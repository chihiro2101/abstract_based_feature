kerry packer and the australian television industry since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions the correlation between sports , corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to australian sports administrators at the time with nine 's ratings languishing , packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire he approached the acb with an offer of a 1.5 million for three years ( eight times the previous contract ) , yet he was rebuffed the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 robertson managed several high-profile australian cricketers such as dennis lillee packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world for the first time , the game 's officialdom had a demonstration of packer 's wherewithal : he immediately doubled his original offer and won the contract by the time the season climaxed with the centenary test match between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground in march 1977 , about two dozen players had committed to packer 's enterprise , which as yet had no grounds to play on , no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer news of the wsc plans were inadvertently leaked to australian journalists , who broke the story on 9 may immediately , all hell broke loose in the hitherto conservative world of cricket not unexpectedly , the english were critical of what they quickly dubbed the '' packer circus '' and reserved particular vitriol for the english captain tony greig , for his central role in organising the break-away it seemed certain that all packer players would be banned from test and first class cricket the australian players were a divided group and the management made their displeasure clear to the packer signees accessed 28 july 2007 dispirited by this turn of events and hampered by poor form and indifferent weather , australia crashed to a 3–0 defeat , surrendering the ashes won two years before that interview created waves across the caribbean and even in world cricket he appeared on david frost 's the frost programme to debate his concept with commentators jim laker and robin marlar the show significantly raised packer 's profile and converted some to his way of thinking the main goal of his trip was to meet the game 's authorities and reach some type of compromise benaud 's standing in the game and his journalistic background helped steer packer through the politics of the game after ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground , packer demanded that the icc award him the exclusive australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended had i got those tv rights i was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board this outburst undid any goodwill that packer had created during his earlier television appearance , and alarmed his contracted players , who had viewed his scheme as being as much philanthropic as commercial packer moved quickly to shore up support , meeting with the players and taking legal action to prevent third parties from inducing players to break their contracts the cricket authority 's counsel said that if the top players deserted traditional cricket then gate receipts would decline players could not be criticized for entering the contracts in secrecy as the main authorities would deny the players the opportunity to enjoy the advantages offered by wsc english county cricket teams were pleased as their players who had signed to play for packer were still eligible to play for them left official cricket won a series of minor victories – packer was unable to use the terms '' test match '' or call their team of australians '' australia '' , or use the official rules of cricket , which are the copyright of the marylebone cricket club so the five-day matches became '' supertests '' , played by the '' wsc australian xi '' and richie benaud set to work writing rules and playing conditions for the series however , packer hired the brilliant curator john maley away from the gabba ground in brisbane , and he pioneered the concept of drop-in pitch however , wsc used the west indian players in the world team as well the first wsc game , a supertest '' between the australians and the west indians began at vfl park on 2 december 1977 to counteract the continual rotation of pace bowlers on pitches of unproven quality , wsc batsmen felt the need to increase their bodily protection until that moment , wsc had looked suspiciously like a thrown-together entertainment package ; hookes ' injury impressed the contest 's intensity on all observers virtually all batsmen in wsc and official test matches were sporting some form of protective headwear many took a lead from the hostile press , and official cricket benefited from a dramatic test series played between australia and a touring indian team but a series of misfortunes and poor decisions came to plague the acb in their battle to stay ahead of packer the official australian team toured the caribbean under bobby simpson in march 1978 ostensibly , india were not involved as yet , but rumours abounded that their captain bishan bedi and star batsman sunil gavaskar had signed wsc options

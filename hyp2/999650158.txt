kerry packer and the australian television industry in the mid-1970s , the australian television industry was at a crossroads since its inception in 1956 , commercial television in australia had developed a reliance on imported programmes , particularly from the united states , as buying them was cheaper than commissioning australian productions agitation for more australian-made programming gained impetus from the '' tv : make it australian '' campaign in 1970 the advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and , importantly , australian sport counted as local content the correlation between sports , corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to australian sports administrators at the time with nine 's ratings languishing , packer sought to turn the network around via an aggressive strategy that included more sports programming he spent millions of dollars revamping the australian golf club in sydney as a permanent home for the tournament packer was a fan of cricket , which was undergoing a resurgence in popularity during the mid-1970s in 1976 , packer sought the rights to televise australia 's home test matches , the contract for which was about to expire he approached the acb with an offer of a 1.5 million for three years ( eight times the previous contract ) , yet he was rebuffed the acb felt loyal to the abc , which had broadcast the game for twenty years when the commercial networks showed little interest in the game packer believed that there was an '' old-boy network '' element to the decision , mcfarline ( 1977 ) , p 157 and he was furious at the dismissive way that his bid was handled the government-funded abc could not hope to match a commercial network 's bid , but they were awarded another three-year contract worth only 210,000 , commencing with the 1976–77 season determined to get some cricket on channel nine , packer put an offer to the test and county cricket board ( tccb ) to telecast the australian cricket team in england in 1977 his interest was further stimulated by a proposal to play some televised exhibition matches , an idea presented to him by west australian businessmen john cornell and austin robertson packer took this idea , then fleshed it out into a full series between the best australian players and a team from the rest of the world in early 1977 , he began contracting a list of australian players provided by recently retired australian test captain ian chappell a bigger coup was achieved when packer convinced the england captain tony greig to not only sign on , but to act as an agent in signing many players around the world by the time the season climaxed with the centenary test match between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground in march 1977 , about two dozen players had committed to packer 's enterprise , which as yet had no grounds to play on , no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world it was a measure of the players ' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet keep everything covert by the time the australian team arrived to tour england in may 1977 , thirteen of the seventeen members of the squad had committed to packer news of the wsc plans were inadvertently leaked to australian journalists , who broke the story on 9 may the australian players were a divided group and the management made their displeasure clear to the packer signees accessed 28 july 2007 dispirited by this turn of events and hampered by poor form and indifferent weather , australia crashed to a 3–0 defeat , surrendering the ashes won two years before he appeared on david frost 's the frost programme to debate his concept with commentators jim laker and robin marlar the main goal of his trip was to meet the game 's authorities and reach some type of compromise after ninety minutes of compromise from both sides had almost created common ground , packer demanded that the icc award him the exclusive australian television rights after the 1978–79 season ended had i got those tv rights i was prepared to withdraw from the scene and leave the running of cricket to the board the icc decided to treat packer 's scheme with contempt when a month later they decided packer 's matches would not be given first-class status and the players involved would be banned from test match and first class cricket packer 's lawyers stated that the icc had tried to force the packer players to break their contracts and to prevent others from joining them english county cricket teams were pleased as their players who had signed to play for packer were still eligible to play for them left official cricket won a series of minor victories – packer was unable to use the terms '' test match '' or call their team of australians '' australia '' , or use the official rules of cricket , which are the copyright of the marylebone cricket club the obvious problem was preparing grass pitches of suitable standard at these venues , where none had existed previously after wsc concluded , maley was the curator of the waca ground in perth from 1980–88 these pitches were grown in hothouses outside the venue , then dropped into the playing surface with cranes another unexpected element of the series was the emergence of a west indian side the first wsc game , a supertest '' between the australians and the west indians began at vfl park on 2 december 1977 the standard of the cricket was excellent , but the crowds were poor , which was emphasised by the stadium 's capacity of 79,000 between the two wsc seasons , the united front presented by the icc countries began to erode the west indies were the most financially vulnerable nation , and only voted for the original icc in the interests of unity meanwhile , wsc continued to up the stakes for the embattled acb , optioning a number of young australians and signing more overseas players : they now had well over 50 cricketers under contract after organising the tours of new zealand and the west indies , wsc began making noises about a tour to england and signing enough players for stand-alone england and pakistan teams a few days later , the official australian team was humbled in the first test against england at brisbane , a precursor to a 5–1 thrashing for a side now captained by the unprepared graham yallop crucially , packer drove home the lesson that cricket was a marketable game , which could generate huge revenues wsc 's advertising jingle '' c'mon aussie c'mon '' was released as a single and was number one on the australian charts in february 1979 foreword by richie benaud golden press ( 1979 ) : '' cricket alight ! world series cricket , in australia , new zealand and the west indies '' , macarthur press

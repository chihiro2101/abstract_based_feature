the ford taunus g93a was a development of the ford eifel , and used the same 1172-cc four cylinder engine , but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body due to the war , production was interrupted from 1942 to 1948 ; 7,128 were made , including estate cars and light vans from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine with the introduction of the new 12m line ( internal code p4 ) for 1962 came the v4 engine , which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17m/20m became the base engine for the taunus m-series the 20m and 26m models had the ford cologne v6 engine , which is basically the same engine design with two extra cylinders added numbers refer to the engine displacement ; 1200 , 1500 , 1700 & nbsp ; cc , etc however , a few exceptions from that rule were made , such as 17m 1800 , which was powered by the v6 in its smallest displacement of 90.777 l and the 20m 2300s ( in the later p7 series ) , which used a 2.3-l version of the same engine the ford taunus p1 was the first new german ford after world war ii something else the new ford taunus 12m had in common with british fords was the retention of an old side-valve engine at a time when competitors were increasingly moving over to overhead-valve units the car with the bigger engine was called taunus 12m 1.5-litre the new ford taunus p4 was similar in size , but a completely new car based on the ford cardinal project : new body , new v4 engine , front-wheel drive it was the first ford car with front-wheel drive ( second is ford corcel , third is ford fiesta ) the ford taunus p2 was as long as ( though significantly narrower than ) the british consul mk2 , but a different car the transatlantic flamboyance of the car 's styling gained it the sobriquet '' baroque taunus '' , showing styling influences from the north american mercury monterey of the same time period the p2 used an overhead-valve ( ohv ) engine with 1698 cc and 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) a maximum speed of 128 & nbsp ; km/h ( 80 & nbsp ; mph ) was quoted the ford taunus p3 had a completely new body in a very modern style the 17m now gets a v4 engine : 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) , 140 & nbsp ; km/h ( 88 & nbsp ; mph ) 1.7 litre : 1699 cc , 65 or 70 & nbsp ; hp ( 48 or 51 & nbsp ; kw ) , 145 or 150 & nbsp ; km/h ( 91 or 94 & nbsp ; mph ) new 20m gets a v6 engine with 1.8 litres and 82 & nbsp ; hp , or 2.0 litres ( 1998 cc ) and 85 or 90 & nbsp ; hp ( 63 or 66 & nbsp ; kw ) with a top speed of 158 or 161 & nbsp ; km/h ( 99 or 101 & nbsp ; mph ) it was the 20m 2.3 litre : 2293 cc , 108 & nbsp ; hp ( 79 & nbsp ; kw ) , 170 & nbsp ; km/h ( 106 & nbsp ; mph )

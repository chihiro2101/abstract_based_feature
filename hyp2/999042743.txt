the ford taunus g93a was a development of the ford eifel , and used the same 1172-cc four cylinder engine , but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) taunus was also sometimes adopted as the brand name in export markets , particularly where british and north american fords were also available the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine with the introduction of the new 12m line ( internal code p4 ) for 1962 came the v4 engine , which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17m/20m became the base engine for the taunus m-series . first generation 12m ( g13 ) ( 1952–1959 ) , 15m ( 1955–1959 ) the ford taunus p1 was the first new german ford after world war ii something else the new ford taunus 12m had in common with british fords was the retention of an old side-valve engine at a time when competitors were increasingly moving over to overhead-valve units the taunus 15m used a new and more powerful engine : 12m : 1172 cc , 38 & nbsp ; hp ( 28 & nbsp ; kw ) , 112 & nbsp ; km/h ( 70 & nbsp ; mph ) 15m : 1498 cc , 55 & nbsp ; hp ( 40 & nbsp ; kw ) , 128 & nbsp ; km/h ( 80 & nbsp ; mph ) body styles were two-door sedan , two-door station wagon , and sedan delivery the car with the bigger engine was called taunus 12m 1.5-litre the new ford taunus p4 was similar in size , but a completely new car based on the ford cardinal project : new body , new v4 engine , front-wheel drive it was the first ford car with front-wheel drive ( second is ford corcel , third is ford fiesta ) the ford taunus p6 came with new bodies , whilst engines and platform were continued the transatlantic flamboyance of the car 's styling gained it the sobriquet '' baroque taunus '' , showing styling influences from the north american mercury monterey of the same time period the p2 used an overhead-valve ( ohv ) engine with 1698 cc and 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) although the 1.7-litre version was launched with the same 60 ps power output as the outgoing model , the new model was a full 10 & nbsp ; km/h ( 6 & nbsp ; mph ) faster , which was attributed to improved aerodynamics and a lighter body shell the 17m now gets a v4 engine : 1.5 litre : 1498 cc , 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) , 140 & nbsp ; km/h ( 88 & nbsp ; mph ) 1.7 litre : 1699 cc , 65 or 70 & nbsp ; hp ( 48 or 51 & nbsp ; kw ) , 145 or 150 & nbsp ; km/h ( 91 or 94 & nbsp ; mph ) it was the 20m 2.3 litre : 2293 cc , 108 & nbsp ; hp ( 79 & nbsp ; kw ) , 170 & nbsp ; km/h ( 106 & nbsp ; mph ) the taunus tc and cortina mk.iii were both developed under the auspices of ford of europe , and most major components including key parts of the bodyshell were identical the taunus tc along with the cortina mk iii and their successors have been produced in slightly updated forms in europe , argentina and widely across asia by ford or their local co-operators cortinas were also built in small numbers starting with the predecessor cortina mk ii throughout the model series ' european/east asian lifespan under license by korean automaker hyundai

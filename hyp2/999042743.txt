the ford taunus g93a was a development of the ford eifel , and used the same 1172-cc four cylinder engine , but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body it was the first german ford to have hydraulic brakes due to the war , production was interrupted from 1942 to 1948 ; 7,128 were made , including estate cars and light vans from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine with the introduction of the new 12m line ( internal code p4 ) for 1962 came the v4 engine , which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17m/20m became the base engine for the taunus m-series the 20m and 26m models had the ford cologne v6 engine , which is basically the same engine design with two extra cylinders added however , a few exceptions from that rule were made , such as 17m 1800 , which was powered by the v6 in its smallest displacement of 90.777 l and the 20m 2300s ( in the later p7 series ) , which used a 2.3-l version of the same engine the ford taunus p1 was the first new german ford after world war ii it featured ponton styling , similar in style to british ford zephyr it was the first ford car with front-wheel drive ( second is ford corcel , third is ford fiesta ) the ford taunus p6 came with new bodies , whilst engines and platform were continued growing prosperity in postwar germany encouraged ford to offer a line of bigger and more expensive cars the ford taunus p2 was as long as ( though significantly narrower than ) the british consul mk2 , but a different car the transatlantic flamboyance of the car 's styling gained it the sobriquet '' baroque taunus '' , showing styling influences from the north american mercury monterey of the same time period the p2 used an overhead-valve ( ohv ) engine with 1698 cc and 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) however , in germany the concept of streamlining in cars was associated with narrow passenger cabins reminiscent of the 1930s and of the still popular volkswagen type 1 it was the 20m 2.3 litre : 2293 cc , 108 & nbsp ; hp ( 79 & nbsp ; kw ) , 170 & nbsp ; km/h ( 106 & nbsp ; mph ) shrinking sales of the p7 forced ford to offer a restyled car only one year later , and the new car was again called p7 between 1970 and 1975 , for the first taunus tc , a fashionable fast-back coup√© was also included in the taunus range the taunus was produced in argentina from 1974 up until the end of 1984 , when the production assembly was sold to turkey to manufacture the otosan taunus

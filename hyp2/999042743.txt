the ford taunus g93a was a development of the ford eifel , and used the same 1172-cc four cylinder engine , but in a longer chassis and a streamlined body from 1952 to 1968 , all german fords were called the taunus , using the model names 12m , 15m , 17m , 20m , and 26m ( on some scandinavian markets , for a short while the branding 10m was used on a slightly better-equipped export version of the early taunus , which is said to be the precursor of later uses ) taunus was also sometimes adopted as the brand name in export markets , particularly where british and north american fords were also available the 12m , 15m , and 17m models had a stone engine , which in the first 12m was a carryover of the sidevalve ( flathead ) engine from the first taunus series , and beginning with the 15m , it was replaced by an overhead-valve design similar to the british ford consul engine with the introduction of the new 12m line ( internal code p4 ) for 1962 came the v4 engine , which starting in late 1964 with the larger 17m/20m became the base engine for the taunus m-series the 20m and 26m models had the ford cologne v6 engine , which is basically the same engine design with two extra cylinders added numbers refer to the engine displacement ; 1200 , 1500 , 1700 & nbsp ; cc , etc however , a few exceptions from that rule were made , such as 17m 1800 , which was powered by the v6 in its smallest displacement of 90.777 l and the 20m 2300s ( in the later p7 series ) , which used a 2.3-l version of the same engine the ford taunus p1 was the first new german ford after world war ii something else the new ford taunus 12m had in common with british fords was the retention of an old side-valve engine at a time when competitors were increasingly moving over to overhead-valve units the taunus 15m used a new and more powerful engine : 12m : 1172 cc , 38 & nbsp ; hp ( 28 & nbsp ; kw ) , 112 & nbsp ; km/h ( 70 & nbsp ; mph ) 15m : 1498 cc , 55 & nbsp ; hp ( 40 & nbsp ; kw ) , 128 & nbsp ; km/h ( 80 & nbsp ; mph ) body styles were two-door sedan , two-door station wagon , and sedan delivery the second generation 12m was not a new car , but a reworking of the 1952 model the ford taunus p6 came with new bodies , whilst engines and platform were continued growing prosperity in postwar germany encouraged ford to offer a line of bigger and more expensive cars the ford taunus p2 was as long as ( though significantly narrower than ) the british consul mk2 , but a different car the p2 used an overhead-valve ( ohv ) engine with 1698 cc and 60 & nbsp ; hp ( 44 & nbsp ; kw ) the ford taunus p3 had a completely new body in a very modern style the ford taunus p5 came with a new body and new engines the taunus tc and cortina mk.iii were both developed under the auspices of ford of europe , and most major components including key parts of the bodyshell were identical the taunus tc along with the cortina mk iii and their successors have been produced in slightly updated forms in europe , argentina and widely across asia by ford or their local co-operators a couple of different tc2 ford taunus models were driven by barry foster in his portrayal as amsterdam detective van der valk in the original series a 1979 ford taunus is a main feature of the swedish television show byh√•la

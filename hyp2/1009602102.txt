in these species , such as many species of coral reef fishes , sex change is a normal anatomical process in the wrasses ( the family labridae ) , sex change is from female to male , with the largest female of the harem changing into a male and taking over the harem upon the disappearance of the previous dominant male natural sex change , in both directions , has also been reported in mushroom corals although two sex organs are present during the embryonic stages of all birds , once a chicken 's female hormones come into effect , it typically develops only the left ovary the condition could also be caused by mycotoxins that can develop when animal feed is stored , and these have the same effect as synthetic hormones in about 10 percent of cases , if eggs fertilized with male chromosomes are cooled by a few degrees for three days after laying , the relative activity of the sex hormones will favour development of female characteristics several medical conditions can result in an apparent sex change in humans , where the appearance at birth is somewhat , mostly , or completely of one sex , but changes over the course of a lifetime to being somewhat , mostly , or completely of the other sex the term '' sex change '' is sometimes also used for the whole process of changing gender role ( '' living as a woman '' instead of living as a man , or vice versa ) , not limited to medical procedures ) many people regard the term '' sex reassignment surgery '' as preferable to '' sex change ''

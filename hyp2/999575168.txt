when two or more notes are played through a distortion process that nonlinearity transforms the audio signal , additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes ( intermodulation distortion ) '' when a typical chord containing such intervals ( for example , a major or minor chord ) is played through distortion , the number of different frequencies generated , and the complex ratios between them , can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct however , in a power chord , the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3:2 even when played without distortion , the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound , owing to the resultant tone ( combination tone ) effect thumb theorists are divided on whether a power chord can be considered a chord in the traditional sense , with some requiring a 'chord ' to contain a minimum of three degrees of the scale however , the term is accepted as a pop and rock music term , most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock , heavy metal , punk rock , and similar genres the use of the term '' power chord '' has , to some extent , spilled over into the vocabulary of other instrumentalists , such as keyboard and synthesizer players they can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note , which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies , but still retains the character of a power chord this gives the power chord a chameleon-like property ; if played where a major chord might be expected , it can sound like a major chord , but when played where a minor chord might be expected , it sounds minor power chords ' use in rock music can be traced back to commercial recordings in the 1950s : power chords are important in many forms of punk rock music note that the two power chords are a major third apart : if the first chord is the tonic the second is the minor submediant perhaps the most common implementation is 1-5-1 ' , that is , the root note , a note a fifth above the root , and a note an octave above the root d5 e5 g5 a5 d5 a5 d5 g5 e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5 -- -- -- 10 -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -10 -- -- -5 -- -- -- 3 -- -- -- 8 -- -- - g -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- 2 -- -- - ( 2 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- d -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- - ( 7 ) -- -- ( 2 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a -- -- -5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- - ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- e -- -- ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- with the drop d tuning—or any other dropped tuning for that matter—power chords with the bass on the sixth string can be played with one finger , and d power chords can be played on three open strings

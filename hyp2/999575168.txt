when two or more notes are played through a distortion process that nonlinearity transforms the audio signal , additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes ( intermodulation distortion ) '' when a typical chord containing such intervals ( for example , a major or minor chord ) is played through distortion , the number of different frequencies generated , and the complex ratios between them , can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct however , in a power chord , the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3:2 when played through distortion , the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes , producing a more coherent sound the intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions , and with enough distortion , a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion , giving a richer , more bassy and more subjectively 'powerful ' sound than the undistorted signal even when played without distortion , the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound , owing to the resultant tone ( combination tone ) effect power chords also have the advantage of being relatively easy to play ( see '' fingering '' below ) , allowing fast chord changes and easy incorporation into melody and riffs thumb theorists are divided on whether a power chord can be considered a chord in the traditional sense , with some requiring a 'chord ' to contain a minimum of three degrees of the scale however , the term is accepted as a pop and rock music term , most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock , heavy metal , punk rock , and similar genres they can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note , which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies , but still retains the character of a power chord this gives the power chord a chameleon-like property ; if played where a major chord might be expected , it can sound like a major chord , but when played where a minor chord might be expected , it sounds minor note that the two power chords are a major third apart : if the first chord is the tonic the second is the minor submediant when the strings are a fourth apart , especially the lower four strings in guitar tuning , the lowest note is played with some fret on some string and the higher two notes are two frets higher on the next two strings d5 e5 g5 a5 d5 a5 d5 g5 e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -5 -- -- -- 10 -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -10 -- -- -5 -- -- -- 3 -- -- -- 8 -- -- - g -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 7 -- -- -- 2 -- -- - ( 2 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- d -- -- -7 -- -- -- 9 -- -- -- 5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- - ( 7 ) -- -- ( 2 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a -- -- -5 -- -- -- 7 -- -- - ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- e -- -- ( 5 ) -- -- ( 7 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- with the drop d tuning—or any other dropped tuning for that matter—power chords with the bass on the sixth string can be played with one finger , and d power chords can be played on three open strings

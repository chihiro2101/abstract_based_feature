'' when a typical chord containing such intervals ( for example , a major or minor chord ) is played through distortion , the number of different frequencies generated , and the complex ratios between them , can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct however , in a power chord , the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3:2 when played through distortion , the intermodulation leads to the production of partials closely related in frequency to the harmonics of the original two notes , producing a more coherent sound even when played without distortion , the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound , owing to the resultant tone ( combination tone ) effect however , the term is accepted as a pop and rock music term , most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock , heavy metal , punk rock , and similar genres for example , '' c5 '' or '' c ( no 3 ) '' refer to playing the root ( c ) and fifth ( g ) they can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note , which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies , but still retains the character of a power chord this gives the power chord a chameleon-like property ; if played where a major chord might be expected , it can sound like a major chord , but when played where a minor chord might be expected , it sounds minor although classical guitar composer francisco tárrega used it before him , modern musicians use villa-lobo ’ s version to this day power chords ' use in rock music can be traced back to commercial recordings in the 1950s : power chords are important in many forms of punk rock music note that the two power chords are a major third apart : if the first chord is the tonic the second is the minor submediant perhaps the most common implementation is 1-5-1 ' , that is , the root note , a note a fifth above the root , and a note an octave above the root d5 e5 e -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- b -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- g -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- d -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- - a -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- - d -- 0 -- -- -- -2 -- -- - occasionally , open , '' stacked '' power chords with more than three notes are used in drop d

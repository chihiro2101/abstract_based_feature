when two or more notes are played through a distortion process that nonlinearity transforms the audio signal , additional partials are generated at the sums and differences of the frequencies of the harmonics of those notes ( intermodulation distortion ) '' when a typical chord containing such intervals ( for example , a major or minor chord ) is played through distortion , the number of different frequencies generated , and the complex ratios between them , can make the resulting sound messy and indistinct however , in a power chord , the ratio between the frequencies of the root and fifth are very close to the just interval 3:2 the intermodulation makes the spectrum of the sound expand in both directions , and with enough distortion , a new fundamental frequency component appears an octave lower than the root note of the chord played without distortion , giving a richer , more bassy and more subjectively 'powerful ' sound than the undistorted signal even when played without distortion , the simple ratios between the harmonics in the notes of a power chord can give a stark and powerful sound , owing to the resultant tone ( combination tone ) effect power chords also have the advantage of being relatively easy to play ( see '' fingering '' below ) , allowing fast chord changes and easy incorporation into melody and riffs thumb theorists are divided on whether a power chord can be considered a chord in the traditional sense , with some requiring a 'chord ' to contain a minimum of three degrees of the scale they can also be played with octave doublings of the root or fifth note , which makes a sound that is subjectively higher pitched with less power in the low frequencies , but still retains the character of a power chord this refers to the fact that a power chord is neither major nor minor , as there is no third present this gives the power chord a chameleon-like property ; if played where a major chord might be expected , it can sound like a major chord , but when played where a minor chord might be expected , it sounds minor the first written instance of a power chord for guitar in the twentieth century is to be found in the '' preludes '' of heitor villa-lobos , brazilian composer of the early twentieth century note that the two power chords are a major third apart : if the first chord is the tonic the second is the minor submediant when the strings are a fourth apart , especially the lower four strings in guitar tuning , the lowest note is played with some fret on some string and the higher two notes are two frets higher on the next two strings ) when the strings are a fourth apart , the lower two notes are played with some fret on some two strings and the highest note is two frets higher on the next string

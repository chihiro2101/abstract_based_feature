technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible : making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display , it is possible to create a see-through effect though stealth technology is declared to be invisible to radar , all officially disclosed applications of the technology can only reduce the size and/or clarity of the signature detected by radar 2006 : a team effort of researchers from britain and the us announced the development of a real cloak of invisibility , though it is only in its first stages engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility ( cloaks ) for objects the theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock unlike traditional camouflage materials , which are limited to specific conditions such as forests or deserts , according to cramer this '' invisibility cloak '' works in any environment or season , at any time of day in 2020 , a physical phenomenon ( related to the electronic resonance of laser processed materials ) that allows the direct fabrication of invisible structures was discovered in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off ) where magical invisibility is concerned , the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible

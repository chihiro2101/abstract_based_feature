technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible : making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display , it is possible to create a see-through effect in filmmaking , people , objects , or backgrounds can be made to look invisible on camera through a process known as chroma keying engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility ( cloaks ) for objects the technique is predicted to be applied to radio waves within five years , and the distortion of visible light is an eventual possibility comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow they demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional ( 3-d ) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar , light or other waves around an object xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it , making it seem to disappear '' in turkey in 2009 , bilkent university search center of nanotechnology researches explained and published in new journal of physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off ) where magical invisibility is concerned , the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible

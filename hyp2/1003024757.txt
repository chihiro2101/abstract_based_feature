technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible : making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display , it is possible to create a see-through effect 2006 : a team effort of researchers from britain and the us announced the development of a real cloak of invisibility , though it is only in its first stages in filmmaking , people , objects , or backgrounds can be made to look invisible on camera through a process known as chroma keying engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility ( cloaks ) for objects the technique is predicted to be applied to radio waves within five years , and the distortion of visible light is an eventual possibility comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it , making it seem to disappear they discovered that the structure of a material can be modified to be usable for frequencies operating photonic devices and sensors , for example , while the structural modification becomes invisible for frequencies detectable by the eye in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off ) where magical invisibility is concerned , the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible

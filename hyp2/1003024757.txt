2006 : a team effort of researchers from britain and the us announced the development of a real cloak of invisibility , though it is only in its first stages engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility ( cloaks ) for objects comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow they demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional ( 3-d ) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar , light or other waves around an object xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it , making it seem to disappear '' uc berkeley researcher jason valentine 's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum , in a region used in fibre optics : 'instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water , it would actually appear to be above the water 's surface '' in turkey in 2009 , bilkent university search center of nanotechnology researches explained and published in new journal of physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc in 2019 , hyperstealth biotechnology has patented the technology behind a material that bends light to make people and objects near invisible to the naked eye in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off ) where magical invisibility is concerned , the issue may arise of whether the clothing worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible

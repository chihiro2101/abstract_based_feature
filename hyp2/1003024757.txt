though stealth technology is declared to be invisible to radar , all officially disclosed applications of the technology can only reduce the size and/or clarity of the signature detected by radar 2006 : a team effort of researchers from britain and the us announced the development of a real cloak of invisibility , though it is only in its first stages the technique is predicted to be applied to radio waves within five years , and the distortion of visible light is an eventual possibility the theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists comparing light waves to the water , and whatever object that is being '' cloaked '' to the stone , the goal is to have light waves pass around that object , leaving no visible aspects of it , possibly not even a shadow they demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional ( 3-d ) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar , light or other waves around an object xiang zhang , of the university of california , berkeley said : '' in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock '' in turkey in 2009 , bilkent university search center of nanotechnology researches explained and published in new journal of physics that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc in 2019 , hyperstealth biotechnology has patented the technology behind a material that bends light to make people and objects near invisible to the naked eye in fiction , people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means : magical objects such as rings , cloaks and amulets can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility ( or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off ) in general they are also regarded as being invisible , but in some instances clothing remains visible and must be removed for the full invisibility effect .

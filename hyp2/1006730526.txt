the production of a rna copy from a dna strand is called transcription , and is performed by rna polymerases , which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing rna strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases this rna is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ dna strand , with the exception that thymines ( t ) are replaced with uracils ( u ) in the rna in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding rnas ( e.g rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna the pre-mrna is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines ( a ) are added to form poly ( a ) tail , which protects the rna from degradation the poly ( a ) tail is bound by multiple poly ( a ) -binding protein necessary for mrna export and translation re-initiation in the inverse process of deadenylation , poly ( a ) tails are shortened by the ccr4-not 3′-5′ exonuclease , which often leads to full transcript decay because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome in prokaryotes , transcription and translation happen together , whilst in eukaryotes , the nuclear membrane separates the two processes , giving time for rna processing to occur in the case of ribosomal rnas ( rrna ) , they are often transcribed as a pre-rrna that contains one or more rrnas while snorna part basepair with the target rna and thus position the modification at a precise site , the protein part performs the catalytical reaction export of rnas requires association with specific proteins known as exportins for some rna ( non-coding rna ) the mature rna is the final gene product in the case of messenger rna ( mrna ) the rna is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins mrna carrying a single protein sequence ( common in eukaryotes ) is monocistronic whilst mrna carrying multiple protein sequences ( common in prokaryotes ) is known as polycistronic transfer rnas with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created in eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be this is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a signal peptide on the growing ( nascent ) amino acid chain this polypeptide lacks any developed three-dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the neighboring figure ) amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) known as the native state similarly , rna chaperones help rnas attain their functional shapes assisting protein folding is one of the main roles of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes . regulation of gene expression regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene control of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them ; in turn , this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment , external signals , damage to the cell , and other stimuli a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism any step of gene expression may be modulated , from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein the stability of the final gene product , whether it is rna or protein , also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level x-inactivation in female mammals to prevent an '' overdose '' of the genes it contains direct interaction with dna is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein changes transcription levels genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription the mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied , from blocking key binding sites on the dna for rna polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting rna polymerase binding the activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including phosphorylated , acetylated , or glycosylated the nuclear membrane in eukaryotes allows further regulation of transcription factors by the duration of their presence in the nucleus , which is regulated by reversible changes in their structure and by binding of other proteins environmental stimuli or endocrine signals may cause modification of regulatory proteins eliciting cascades of intracellular signals , which result in regulation of gene expression these effects are referred to as epigenetic and involve the higher order structure of dna , non-sequence specific dna binding proteins and chemical modification of dna dna methylation is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation methylation of cytosine primarily occurs in dinucleotide sequences where a cytosine is followed by a guanine , a cpg site methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression methylation of cpgs in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription while methylation of cpgs in the body of a gene increases expression demethylation of cpgs in a gene promoter by tet enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene inhibition of protein translation is a major target for toxins and antibiotics , so they can kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control for genes encoding proteins , the expression level can be directly assessed by a number of methods with some clear analogies to the techniques for mrna quantification it is very difficult to clone a gfp-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often can not be used to measure endogenous gene expression gene expression omnibus ( geo ) at ncbi expression atlas at the ebi mouse gene expression database at the jackson laboratory collectf : a database of experimentally validated transcription factor-binding sites in bacteria

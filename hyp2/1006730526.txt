the production of a rna copy from a dna strand is called transcription , and is performed by rna polymerases , which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing rna strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases this rna is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ dna strand , with the exception that thymines ( t ) are replaced with uracils ( u ) in the rna in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna types and steps involved in the maturation processes vary between coding and non-coding prernas ; i.e even though prerna molecules for both mrna and trna undergo splicing , the steps and machinery involved are different in certain cases , some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in mature mrna this so-called alternative splicing creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome extensive rna processing may be an evolution made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes in most organisms ncrna are transcribed as precursors that undergo further processing the pre-rrna is cleaved and modified ( 2′-o-methylation and pseudouridine formation ) at specific sites by approximately 150 different small nucleolus-restricted rna species , called snornas while snorna part basepair with the target rna and thus position the modification at a precise site , the protein part performs the catalytical reaction even snrnas and snornas themselves undergo series of modification before they become part of functional rnp complex specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given rna type in some cases rnas are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm , such as a synapse ; they are then towed by motor proteins that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences ( called '' zipcodes '' ) on the rna for some rna ( non-coding rna ) the mature rna is the final gene product mrna carrying a single protein sequence ( common in eukaryotes ) is monocistronic whilst mrna carrying multiple protein sequences ( common in prokaryotes ) is known as polycistronic the correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function , although some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins , for the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures enzymes called chaperones assist the newly formed protein to attain ( fold into ) the 3-dimensional structure it needs to function the efficiency of protein secretion in eukaryotes is very dependent on the signal peptide which has been used in prokaryotes this is normally a simple process due to limited compartmentalisation of the cell in eukaryotes the export pathway is well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these proteins is translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , followed by transport via the golgi apparatus more generally , gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function , and is the basis for cellular differentiation , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated ; these include : a constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene , which is only transcribed when needed a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism some housekeeping genes are transcribed at a relatively constant rate and these genes can be used as a reference point in experiments to measure the expression rates of other genes a facultative gene is a gene only transcribed when needed as opposed to a constitutive gene an inducible gene is a gene whose expression is either responsive to environmental change or dependent on the position in the cell cycle in general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of dna and translation of rna some simple examples of where gene expression is important are : control of insulin expression so it gives a signal for blood glucose regulation cyclin expression levels control progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle the mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied , from blocking key binding sites on the dna for rna polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting rna polymerase binding these changes influence a transcription factor 's ability to bind , directly or indirectly , to promoter dna , to recruit rna polymerase , or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized rna molecule in eukaryotes the structure of chromatin , controlled by the histone code , regulates access to dna with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and heterochromatin areas dna methylation is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation methylation of cytosine primarily occurs in dinucleotide sequences where a cytosine is followed by a guanine , a cpg site methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression demethylation of cpgs in a gene promoter by tet enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene in a rat , contextual fear conditioning ( cfc ) is a painful learning experience three prime untranslated regions ( 3′utrs ) of messenger rnas ( mrnas ) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression proteolysis , other than being involved in breaking down proteins , is also important in activating and deactivating them , and in regulating biological processes such as dna transcription and cell death regulation on each step of gene expression can impact the correlation , as shown for regulation of translation or protein stability it is , however , widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell , for example via an expression vector genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network , with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors , and outputs being the level of gene expression gene expression omnibus ( geo ) at ncbi expression atlas at the ebi mouse gene expression database at the jackson laboratory collectf : a database of experimentally validated transcription factor-binding sites in bacteria

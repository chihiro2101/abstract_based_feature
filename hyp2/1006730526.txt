the production of a rna copy from a dna strand is called transcription , and is performed by rna polymerases , which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing rna strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases this rna is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ dna strand , with the exception that thymines ( t ) are replaced with uracils ( u ) in the rna in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna the pre-mrna is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines ( a ) are added to form poly ( a ) tail , which protects the rna from degradation right a very important modification of eukaryotic pre-mrna is rna splicing because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome extensive rna processing may be an evolution made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes in prokaryotes , transcription and translation happen together , whilst in eukaryotes , the nuclear membrane separates the two processes , giving time for rna processing to occur in the case of ribosomal rnas ( rrna ) , they are often transcribed as a pre-rrna that contains one or more rrnas while snorna part basepair with the target rna and thus position the modification at a precise site , the protein part performs the catalytical reaction the rrna and rna processing factors form large aggregates called the nucleolus after being exported , it is then processed to mature mirnas in the cytoplasm by interaction with the endonuclease dicer , which also initiates the formation of the rna-induced silencing complex , composed of the argonaute protein their bases are methylated or pseudouridinilated by a group of small cajal body-specific rna , which are structurally similar to snornas for some rna ( non-coding rna ) the mature rna is the final gene product in the case of messenger rna ( mrna ) the rna is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins the coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer rna in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane this is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a signal peptide on the growing ( nascent ) amino acid chain amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) known as the native state the resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence ( anfinsen 's dogma ) the correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function , although some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins , for the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures newly synthesized proteins are directed to the eukaryotic sec61 or prokaryotic secyeg translocation channel by signal peptides many proteins are destined for other parts of the cell than the cytosol and a wide range of signalling sequences or signal peptide are used to direct proteins to where they are supposed to be in prokaryotes this is normally a simple process due to limited compartmentalisation of the cell not all proteins remain within the cell and many are exported , for example , digestive enzymes , hormones and extracellular matrix proteins regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene more generally , gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function , and is the basis for cellular differentiation , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated ; these include : a constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene , which is only transcribed when needed a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism examples include actin , gapdh and ubiquitin a facultative gene is a gene only transcribed when needed as opposed to a constitutive gene any step of gene expression may be modulated , from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein the stability of the final gene product , whether it is rna or protein , also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression the majority of gene promoters contain a cpg island with numerous cpg sites intentional degradation of mrna is used not just as a defence mechanism from foreign rna ( normally from viruses ) but also as a route of mrna destabilisation three prime untranslated regions ( 3′utrs ) of messenger rnas ( mrnas ) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression by binding to specific sites within the 3′-utr , mirnas can decrease gene expression of various mrnas by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript the effects of mirna dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depression , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease and autism spectrum disorders inhibition of protein translation is a major target for toxins and antibiotics , so they can kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control protein synthesis inhibitors include the antibiotic neomycin and the toxin ricin genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network , with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors , and outputs being the level of gene expression gene expression omnibus ( geo ) at ncbi expression atlas at the ebi mouse gene expression database at the jackson laboratory collectf : a

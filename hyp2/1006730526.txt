in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna the processing of non-coding rna is described below ( non-coring rna maturation ) they occur if polyadenylation signal sequence ( 5′- aauaaa-3′ ) is present in pre-mrna , which is usually between protein-coding sequence and terminator the pre-mrna is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines ( a ) are added to form poly ( a ) tail , which protects the rna from degradation the poly ( a ) tail is bound by multiple poly ( a ) -binding protein necessary for mrna export and translation re-initiation in the inverse process of deadenylation , poly ( a ) tails are shortened by the ccr4-not 3′-5′ exonuclease , which often leads to full transcript decay because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome extensive rna processing may be an evolution made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes in prokaryotes , transcription and translation happen together , whilst in eukaryotes , the nuclear membrane separates the two processes , giving time for rna processing to occur while snorna part basepair with the target rna and thus position the modification at a precise site , the protein part performs the catalytical reaction this is done either in the nucleoplasm or in the specialized compartments called cajal body export of rnas requires association with specific proteins known as exportins specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given rna type in the case of messenger rna ( mrna ) the rna is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins mrna carrying a single protein sequence ( common in eukaryotes ) is monocistronic whilst mrna carrying multiple protein sequences ( common in prokaryotes ) is known as polycistronic each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer rna in eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane proteins that are supposed to be expressed at the endoplasmic reticulum are recognised part-way through the translation process this is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum when it finds a signal peptide on the growing ( nascent ) amino acid chain amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) known as the native state the correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function , although some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded enzymes called chaperones assist the newly formed protein to attain ( fold into ) the 3-dimensional structure it needs to function similarly , rna chaperones help rnas attain their functional shapes regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene more generally , gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function , and is the basis for cellular differentiation , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated ; these include : a constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene , which is only transcribed when needed a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism any step of gene expression may be modulated , from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein some simple examples of where gene expression is important are : control of insulin expression so it gives a signal for blood glucose regulation cyclin expression levels control progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle direct interaction with dna is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein changes transcription levels genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription the mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied , from blocking key binding sites on the dna for rna polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting rna polymerase binding the activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including phosphorylated , acetylated , or glycosylated environmental stimuli or endocrine signals may cause modification of regulatory proteins eliciting cascades of intracellular signals , which result in regulation of gene expression these effects are referred to as epigenetic and involve the higher order structure of dna , non-sequence specific dna binding proteins and chemical modification of dna in eukaryotes the structure of chromatin , controlled by the histone code , regulates access to dna with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and heterochromatin areas dna methylation and demethylation in transcriptional regulation dna methylation is a widespread mechanism for epigenetic influence on gene expression and is seen in bacteria and eukaryotes and has roles in heritable transcription silencing and transcription regulation methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression methylation of cpgs in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription while methylation of cpgs in the body of a gene increases expression if an mrna molecule has a complementary sequence to a small interfering rna then it is targeted for destruction via the rna interference pathway it is very difficult to clone a gfp-fused protein into its native location in the genome without affecting expression levels so this method often can not be used to measure endogenous gene expression an expression system consists of a gene , normally encoded by dna , and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the dna into mrna and translate the mrna into protein using the reagents provided the following experimental techniques are used to measure gene expression and are listed in roughly chronological order , starting with the older , more established technologies

the production of a rna copy from a dna strand is called transcription , and is performed by rna polymerases , which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing rna strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases this rna is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ dna strand , with the exception that thymines ( t ) are replaced with uracils ( u ) in the rna rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding rnas ( e.g rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the terminator even though prerna molecules for both mrna and trna undergo splicing , the steps and machinery involved are different the processing of non-coding rna is described below ( non-coring rna maturation ) the processing of premrna include 5′ capping , which is set of enzymatic reactions that add 7-methylguanosine ( m 7 g ) to the 5′ end of pre-mrna and thus protect the rna from degradation by exonucleases they occur if polyadenylation signal sequence ( 5′- aauaaa-3′ ) is present in pre-mrna , which is usually between protein-coding sequence and terminator the pre-mrna is first cleaved and then a series of ~200 adenines ( a ) are added to form poly ( a ) tail , which protects the rna from degradation during the process of splicing , an rna-protein catalytical complex known as spliceosome catalyzes two transesterification reactions , which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure , and then splice neighbouring exons together because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome in prokaryotes , transcription and translation happen together , whilst in eukaryotes , the nuclear membrane separates the two processes , giving time for rna processing to occur the pre-rrna is cleaved and modified ( 2′-o-methylation and pseudouridine formation ) at specific sites by approximately 150 different small nucleolus-restricted rna species , called snornas while snorna part basepair with the target rna and thus position the modification at a precise site , the protein part performs the catalytical reaction in the case of mirna , mirnas are first transcribed as primary transcripts or pri-mirna with a cap and poly-a tail and processed to short , 70-nucleotide stem-loop structures known as pre-mirna in the cell nucleus by the enzymes drosha and pasha specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given rna type for some rna ( non-coding rna ) the mature rna is the final gene product in the case of messenger rna ( mrna ) the rna is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according to the order of triplets in the coding region the ribosome helps transfer rna to bind to messenger rna and takes the amino acid from each transfer rna and makes a structure-less protein out of it each mrna molecule is translated into many protein molecules , on average ~2800 in mammals in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) known as the native state enzymes called chaperones assist the newly formed protein to attain ( fold into ) the 3-dimensional structure it needs to function . regulation of gene expression more generally , gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function , and is the basis for cellular differentiation , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism numerous terms are used to describe types of genes depending on how they are regulated ; these include : a constitutive gene is a gene that is transcribed continually as opposed to a facultative gene , which is only transcribed when needed a facultative gene is a gene only transcribed when needed as opposed to a constitutive gene an inducible gene is a gene whose expression is either responsive to environmental change or dependent on the position in the cell cycle any step of gene expression may be modulated , from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein the stability of the final gene product , whether it is rna or protein , also contributes to the expression level of the gene—an unstable product results in a low expression level in general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of dna and translation of rna some simple examples of where gene expression is important are : control of insulin expression so it gives a signal for blood glucose regulation regulation of transcription can be broken down into three main routes of influence ; genetic ( direct interaction of a control factor with the gene ) , modulation interaction of a control factor with the transcription machinery and epigenetic ( non-sequence changes in dna structure that influence transcription ) direct interaction with dna is the simplest and the most direct method by which a protein changes transcription levels genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription the mechanisms for regulating transcription are very varied , from blocking key binding sites on the dna for rna polymerase to acting as an activator and promoting transcription by assisting rna polymerase binding the activity of transcription factors is further modulated by intracellular signals causing protein post-translational modification including phosphorylated , acetylated , or glycosylated these changes influence a transcription factor 's ability to bind , directly or indirectly , to promoter dna , to recruit rna polymerase , or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized rna molecule methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression all transport in and out of the nucleus is via the nuclear pore and transport is controlled by a wide range of importin and exportin proteins expression of a gene coding for a protein is only possible if the messenger rna carrying the code survives long enough to be translated intentional degradation of mrna is used not just as a defence mechanism from foreign rna ( normally from viruses ) but also as a route of mrna destabilisation regulation on each step of gene expression can impact the correlation , as shown for regulation of translation or protein stability analysis of expression is not limited to quantification ; localisation can also be determined by replacing the gene with a new version fused to a green fluorescent protein ( or similar ) marker , expression may be directly quantified in live cells 500px an expression system is a system specifically designed for the production of a gene product of choice genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network , with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors , and outputs being the level of gene expression

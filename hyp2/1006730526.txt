the production of a rna copy from a dna strand is called transcription , and is performed by rna polymerases , which add one ribonucleotide at a time to a growing rna strand as per the complementarity law of the nucleotide bases this rna is complementary to the template 3′ → 5′ dna strand , with the exception that thymines ( t ) are replaced with uracils ( u ) in the rna in prokaryotes , transcription is carried out by a single type of rna polymerase , which needs to bind a dna sequence called a pribnow box with the help of the sigma factor protein ( σ factor ) to start transcription in eukaryotes , transcription is performed in the nucleus by three types of rna polymerases , each of which needs a special dna sequence called the promoter and a set of dna-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process ( see regulation of transcription below ) rna polymerase i is responsible for transcription of ribosomal rna ( rrna ) genes rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding rnas ( e.g rna polymerase iii transcribes 5s rrna , transfer rna ( trna ) genes , and some small non-coding rnas ( e.g while transcription of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates mrna ( mrna ) that is ready for translation into protein , transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a primary transcript of rna ( pre-rna ) , which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature rna types and steps involved in the maturation processes vary between coding and non-coding prernas ; i.e the processing of non-coding rna is described below ( non-coring rna maturation ) the processing of premrna include 5′ capping , which is set of enzymatic reactions that add 7-methylguanosine ( m 7 g ) to the 5′ end of pre-mrna and thus protect the rna from degradation by exonucleases the m 7 g cap is then bound by cap binding complex heterodimer ( cbc20/cbc80 ) , which aids in mrna export to cytoplasm and also protect the rna from decapping because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins , splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression and the size of a species proteome extensive rna processing may be an evolution made possible by the nucleus of eukaryotes export of rnas requires association with specific proteins known as exportins specific exportin molecules are responsible for the export of a given rna type in some cases rnas are additionally transported to a specific part of the cytoplasm , such as a synapse ; they are then towed by motor proteins that bind through linker proteins to specific sequences ( called '' zipcodes '' ) on the rna for some rna ( non-coding rna ) the mature rna is the final gene product in the case of messenger rna ( mrna ) the rna is an information carrier coding for the synthesis of one or more proteins each mrna molecule is translated into many protein molecules , on average ~2800 in mammals in prokaryotes translation generally occurs at the point of transcription ( co-transcriptionally ) , often using a messenger rna that is still in the process of being created many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins , for the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures assisting protein folding is one of the main roles of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes in prokaryotes this is normally a simple process due to limited compartmentalisation of the cell not all proteins remain within the cell and many are exported , for example , digestive enzymes , hormones and extracellular matrix proteins in eukaryotes the export pathway is well developed and the main mechanism for the export of these proteins is translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , followed by transport via the golgi apparatus . regulation of gene expression regulation of gene expression refers to the control of the amount and timing of appearance of the functional product of a gene control of expression is vital to allow a cell to produce the gene products it needs when it needs them ; in turn , this gives cells the flexibility to adapt to a variable environment , external signals , damage to the cell , and other stimuli more generally , gene regulation gives the cell control over all structure and function , and is the basis for cellular differentiation , morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism a housekeeping gene is a gene that is required to maintain basic cellular function and so is typically expressed in all cell types of an organism some housekeeping genes are transcribed at a relatively constant rate and these genes can be used as a reference point in experiments to measure the expression rates of other genes any step of gene expression may be modulated , from the dna-rna transcription step to post-translational modification of a protein in general gene expression is regulated through changes in the number and type of interactions between molecules that collectively influence transcription of dna and translation of rna some simple examples of where gene expression is important are : control of insulin expression so it gives a signal for blood glucose regulation genes often have several protein binding sites around the coding region with the specific function of regulating transcription these changes influence a transcription factor 's ability to bind , directly or indirectly , to promoter dna , to recruit rna polymerase , or to favor elongation of a newly synthesized rna molecule environmental stimuli or endocrine signals may cause modification of regulatory proteins eliciting cascades of intracellular signals , which result in regulation of gene expression these effects are referred to as epigenetic and involve the higher order structure of dna , non-sequence specific dna binding proteins and chemical modification of dna in eukaryotes the structure of chromatin , controlled by the histone code , regulates access to dna with significant impacts on the expression of genes in euchromatin and heterochromatin areas methylation of cytosine in dna has a major role in regulating gene expression methylation of cpgs in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription while methylation of cpgs in the body of a gene increases expression after cfc about 500 genes have increased transcription ( often due to demethylation of cpg sites in a promoter region ) and about 1,000 genes have decreased transcription ( often due to newly formed 5-methylcytosine at cpg sites in a promoter region ) when many of a gene 's promoter cpg sites are methylated the gene becomes silenced for example , in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by cpg island methylation ( see regulation of transcription in cancer ) in eukaryotes , where export of rna is required before translation is possible , nuclear export is thought to provide additional control over gene expression expression of a gene coding for a protein is only possible if the messenger rna carrying the code survives long enough to be translated three prime untranslated regions ( 3′utrs ) of messenger rnas ( mrnas ) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally influence gene expression it is , however , widely used to measure the expression of a gene artificially introduced into the cell , for example via an expression vector genes have sometimes been regarded as nodes in a network , with inputs being proteins such as transcription factors , and outputs being the level of gene expression

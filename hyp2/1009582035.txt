somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg the blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells the second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body skin cells , fat cells , and liver cells are only a few examples ' what is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell after being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell the egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all necessary genetic information from just one parent stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term this gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells , which could then be used in therapies or disease research embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo these cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism a potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient 's particular disease for example , if a person with parkinson 's disease donated his or her somatic cells , the stem cells resulting from scnt would have genes that contribute to parkinson 's disease the resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor , thus avoiding any complications from transplant rejection only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using scnt techniques in human stem cell research despite many attempts , success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited there lies a problem in the human cell 's ability to form a blastocyst ; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development egg cells in mii contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states when the ovum 's nucleus is removed , the cell loses its genetic information another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast , affecting reprogramming ability using mii oocytes from volunteers and their improved scnt procedure , human clone embryos were successfully produced the addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum 's nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and esc isolation there remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells cell stem cell retrieved 18 april 2014 late april 2014 , the new york stem cell foundation was successful in creating scnt stem cells derived from adult somatic cells one of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic some scientists working on scnt-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells though recent studies have put in question how similar ips cells are to embryonic stem cells scnt stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies these have led to some individuals and organizations who are not opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about , or opposed to , scnt research for example , to treat a man with parkinson 's disease , a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by scnt into an egg cell from an egg donor , creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient 's own cells cloning embryogenesis handmade cloning in vitro fertilisation induced stem cells s1909/a2840 rejuvenation stem cell controversy stem cell research

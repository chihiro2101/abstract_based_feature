somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg the blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells the second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body the genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it 'deprogrammed ' what is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell after being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , the single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the original organism ( i.e stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research the aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo controversy surrounds human esc work due to the destruction of viable human embryos leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells , scnt is one such method a potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient 's particular disease '' dolly scientists ' human clone bid '' , bbc news ( september 28 , 2004 , retrieved october 6 , 2006 ) scnt may also be occurring in china despite many attempts , success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited there lies a problem in the human cell 's ability to form a blastocyst ; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development a research group from the oregon health & science university demonstrated scnt procedures developed for primates successfully using skin cells in may 2013 , the oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through scnt , using fetal and infant donor cells the imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human esc this was the first instance of successfully using scnt to reprogram human somatic cells there remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells cell stem cell retrieved 18 april 2014 late april 2014 , the new york stem cell foundation was successful in creating scnt stem cells derived from adult somatic cells one of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic these insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics , demonstrating real scnt stem cell therapeutic potential the impetus for scnt-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells though recent studies have put in question how similar ips cells are to embryonic stem cells scnt stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies somatic cell nuclear transfer ( scnt ) can be inefficient due to stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous these have led to some individuals and organizations who are not opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about , or opposed to , scnt research if successful , human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines cloning embryogenesis handmade cloning in vitro fertilisation induced stem cells s1909/a2840 rejuvenation stem cell controversy stem cell research

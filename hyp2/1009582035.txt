somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg after the somatic cell transfers , the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote the blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells the second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body the genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it 'deprogrammed ' what is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell after being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell the egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all necessary genetic information from just one parent development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , the single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the original organism ( i.e stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research these cells genetics matched the donor organism from which they came this ability allows stem cells to create any cell type , which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells controversy surrounds human esc work due to the destruction of viable human embryos a potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient 's particular disease the disease specific stem cell lines could then be studied in order to better understand the condition the resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor , thus avoiding any complications from transplant rejection only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using scnt techniques in human stem cell research mann , '' the first cloning superpower '' , wired ( january 2003 , retrieved october 6 , 2006 ) in 2005 , a south korean research team led by professor hwang woo-suk , published claims to have derived stem cell lines via scnt , but supported those claims with fabricated data recent evidence has proved that he in fact created a stem cell line from a parthenote there lies a problem in the human cell 's ability to form a blastocyst ; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development a research group from the oregon health & science university demonstrated scnt procedures developed for primates successfully using skin cells egg cells in mii contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human scnt stem cells the addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum 's nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and esc isolation human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells cell stem cell one of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic these insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics , demonstrating real scnt stem cell therapeutic potential using scnt in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success interspecies nuclear transfer ( iscnt ) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer being used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species , or even to restore species after their extinction proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo cloning embryogenesis handmade cloning in vitro fertilisation induced stem cells s1909/a2840 rejuvenation stem cell controversy stem cell research

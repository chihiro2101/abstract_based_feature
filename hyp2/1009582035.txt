somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg the blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells the second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body skin cells , fat cells , and liver cells are only a few examples ' what is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell these are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty ' ovum after being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell the ovum , now containing the somatic cell 's nucleus , is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , the single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the original organism ( i.e stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research for example , if a person with parkinson 's disease donated his or her somatic cells , the stem cells resulting from scnt would have genes that contribute to parkinson 's disease another application of scnt stem cell research is using the patient specific stem cell lines to generate tissues or even organs for transplant into the specific patient the scientist 19 june 2007 though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals , questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum despite many attempts , success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited this is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development the key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase ii ( mii ) of the cell cycle egg cells in mii contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human scnt stem cells in may 2013 , the oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through scnt , using fetal and infant donor cells the addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum 's nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and esc isolation there remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells cell stem cell these insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics , demonstrating real scnt stem cell therapeutic potential some scientists working on scnt-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells though recent studies have put in question how similar ips cells are to embryonic stem cells for instance , an ips cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells , while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron scnt stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies , open letter to us senate on human cloning , ( march 19 , 2002 ) one concern is that blastula creation in scnt-based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans one vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients to address the problem of creating a human egg market , some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs cloning embryogenesis handmade cloning in vitro fertilisation induced stem cells s1909/a2840 rejuvenation stem cell controversy stem cell research

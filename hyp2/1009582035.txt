somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells the second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body the genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it 'deprogrammed ' what is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell after being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell the ovum , now containing the somatic cell 's nucleus , is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research the aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo these cells genetics matched the donor organism from which they came embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo these cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism this ability allows stem cells to create any cell type , which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells controversy surrounds human esc work due to the destruction of viable human embryos a potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient 's particular disease for example , if a person with parkinson 's disease donated his or her somatic cells , the stem cells resulting from scnt would have genes that contribute to parkinson 's disease another application of scnt stem cell research is using the patient specific stem cell lines to generate tissues or even organs for transplant into the specific patient the resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor , thus avoiding any complications from transplant rejection only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using scnt techniques in human stem cell research the key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase ii ( mii ) of the cell cycle egg cells in mii contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast , affecting reprogramming ability in may 2013 , the oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through scnt , using fetal and infant donor cells this was the first instance of successfully using scnt to reprogram human somatic cells this study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their esc there remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells cell stem cell retrieved 18 april 2014 ariana eunjung cha ( 18 april 2014 ) cloning advance using stem cells from human adult reopens ethical questions washington post the group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation the impetus for scnt-based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells one vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients scnt involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the united kingdom , having been incorporated into the human fertilisation and embryology act 1990 cloning embryogenesis handmade cloning in vitro fertilisation induced stem cells s1909/a2840 rejuvenation stem cell controversy stem cell research

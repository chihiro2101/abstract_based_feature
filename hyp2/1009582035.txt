somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg after the somatic cell transfers , the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote the blastocyst stage is developed by the egg to help create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst the first animal to be developed by this technique was dolly , the sheep , in 1996 the process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells the first being a female gamete , known as the ovum ( egg/oocyte ) the second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body the genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it 'deprogrammed ' what is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell these are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty ' ovum after being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell the ovum , now containing the somatic cell 's nucleus , is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide the egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all necessary genetic information from just one parent stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research the aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo for example , if a person with parkinson 's disease donated his or her somatic cells , the stem cells resulting from scnt would have genes that contribute to parkinson 's disease the resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor , thus avoiding any complications from transplant rejection only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using scnt techniques in human stem cell research '' dolly scientists ' human clone bid '' , bbc news ( september 28 , 2004 , retrieved october 6 , 2006 ) scnt may also be occurring in china the scientist 19 june 2007 though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals , questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum despite many attempts , success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited a research group from the oregon health & science university demonstrated scnt procedures developed for primates successfully using skin cells egg cells in mii contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states the addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum 's nucleus and fusion of the somatic cell and the egg improved blastocyst formation and esc isolation human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells cell stem cell retrieved 18 april 2014 ariana eunjung cha ( 18 april 2014 ) cloning advance using stem cells from human adult reopens ethical questions washington post one of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic these insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics , demonstrating real scnt stem cell therapeutic potential one vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients if successful , human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines cloning embryogenesis handmade cloning in vitro fertilisation induced stem cells s1909/a2840 rejuvenation stem cell controversy stem cell research

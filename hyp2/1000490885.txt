clamence often speaks of his love for high , open places — everything from mountain peaks to the top decks of boats moreover , amsterdam is generally described in the fall as a cold , wet place where a thick blanket of fog constantly hangs over the crowded , neon-light-lined streets beside the atmosphere ( which could be established almost anywhere else ) the city also was chosen by camus for a more peculiar reason in the opening pages clamence casually remarks , image : amsterdam airphoto.jpg thumb left 300px amsterdam the '' last circle of hell '' is the site of de wallen red-light district and the location of a bar named mexico city , which clamence frequents nightly , and where the bulk of his narrative gradually unfolds the setting thus serves to illustrate , literally and metaphorically , clamence 's fall from the heights of high-class paris society to the dark , dreary , dantesque underworld of amsterdam , where tortured souls wander aimlessly among each other among other things , the fall is an attempt to explain how humankind could be capable of perpetrating such evils the novel opens with clamence sitting in the bar mexico city casually talking to a stranger — the reader , some would say — about the proper way to order a drink ; for here , despite the cosmopolitan nature of amsterdam , the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than dutch thus , clamence serves as interpreter and he and the stranger , having discovered that they are fellow compatriots who , moreover , both hail from paris , begin discussing more substantive matters clamence tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in paris as a highly successful and well-respected defence lawyer in short , clamence conceived of himself as living purely for the sake of others and '' achieving more than the vulgar ambitious man and rising to that supreme summit where virtue is its own reward '' ( camus 288 ) late one night when crossing the pont royal on his way home from his '' mistress '' , however , clamence comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge several years after the apparent suicide of the woman off the pont royal — and an evidently successful effort to purge the entire event from his memory — clamence is on his way home one autumn evening after a particularly pleasing day of work furthermore , the laughter is described as a '' good , hearty , almost friendly laugh , '' whereas , mere moments later , he describes himself as possessing a '' good , hearty badger '' ( camus 297 ) that evening on the pont des arts represents , for clamence , the collision of his true self with his inflated self-image , and the final realization of his own hypocrisy becomes painfully obvious angry , clamence exits his vehicle in order to confront the man when someone else intervenes and '' informed me that i was the scum of the earth and that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor-cycle between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage '' ( camus 303-4 ) '' in fact , clamence even goes so far as to consider to clamence 's frustration and dismay , however , his efforts in this regard are ineffective , generally because many of the people around him refuse to take him seriously ; they find it inconceivable that a man of his reputation could ever say such things and not be joking the last of clamence 's monologues takes place in his apartment in the ( former ) jewish quarter , and recounts more specifically the events which shaped his current outlook ; in this regard his experiences during the second world war are crucial clamence attempts to justify his possession of the stolen painting in a number of ways , primarily '' because those judges are on their way to meet the lamb , because there is no lamb or innocence any longer , and because the clever rascal who stole the panel was an instrument of the unknown justice that one ought not to thwart '' ( camus 346 ) 1956 , la chute ( french ) , paris : gallimard 1956 , the fall ( translated by justin o'brien ) 2006 , the fall ( translated by robin buss ) , london : penguin

moreover , amsterdam is generally described in the fall as a cold , wet place where a thick blanket of fog constantly hangs over the crowded , neon-light-lined streets beside the atmosphere ( which could be established almost anywhere else ) the city also was chosen by camus for a more peculiar reason in the opening pages clamence casually remarks , image : amsterdam airphoto.jpg thumb left 300px amsterdam the '' last circle of hell '' is the site of de wallen red-light district and the location of a bar named mexico city , which clamence frequents nightly , and where the bulk of his narrative gradually unfolds the setting thus serves to illustrate , literally and metaphorically , clamence 's fall from the heights of high-class paris society to the dark , dreary , dantesque underworld of amsterdam , where tortured souls wander aimlessly among each other indeed , critics have explored at length the parallels between clamence 's fall and dante 's descent through hell in the inferno ( see galpin , king ) clamence tells us that he lives only a short distance from mexico city , in what was — formerly — the jewish quarter , '' until our hitlerian brethren spaced it out a bit the novel opens with clamence sitting in the bar mexico city casually talking to a stranger — the reader , some would say — about the proper way to order a drink ; for here , despite the cosmopolitan nature of amsterdam , the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than dutch thus , clamence serves as interpreter and he and the stranger , having discovered that they are fellow compatriots who , moreover , both hail from paris , begin discussing more substantive matters clamence tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in paris as a highly successful and well-respected defence lawyer late one night when crossing the pont royal on his way home from his '' mistress '' , however , clamence comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge several years after the apparent suicide of the woman off the pont royal — and an evidently successful effort to purge the entire event from his memory — clamence is on his way home one autumn evening after a particularly pleasing day of work he pauses on the empty pont des arts and reflects : clamence turns around to discover that the laughter , of course , was not directed at him , but probably originated from a far-off conversation between friends — such is the rational course of his thought other cars behind him start honking their horns , and clamence politely asks the man several times if he would please move his motorcycle off the road so that others can drive around him ; however , with each repetition of the request , the motorcyclist becomes increasingly agitated and threatens clamence with physical violence angry , clamence exits his vehicle in order to confront the man when someone else intervenes and '' informed me that i was the scum of the earth and that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor-cycle between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage '' ( camus 303-4 ) the feeling of resentment gnaws away at him , and clamence explains that clamence thus arrives at the conclusion that his whole life has in fact been lived in search of honour , recognition , and power over others this realization precipitates an emotional and intellectual crisis for clamence which , moreover , he is unable to avoid , having now discovered it ; the sound of laughter that first struck him on the pont des arts slowly begins to permeate his entire existence one evening a regular patron of mexico city entered the bar with the priceless painting and sold it for a bottle of jenever to the bartender who , for a time , displayed the piece prominently on the wall of his bar clamence attempts to justify his possession of the stolen painting in a number of ways , primarily '' because those judges are on their way to meet the lamb , because there is no lamb or innocence any longer , and because the clever rascal who stole the panel was an instrument of the unknown justice that one ought not to thwart '' ( camus 346 ) 1956 , la chute ( french ) , paris : gallimard 1956 , the fall ( translated by justin o'brien ) 2006 , the fall ( translated by robin buss ) , london : penguin

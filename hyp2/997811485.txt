the sources for áedán 's life include bede 's historia ecclesiastica gentis anglorum ; irish annals , principally the annals of ulster and the annals of tigernach ; and adomnán 's life of saint columba the senchus fer n-alban , a census and genealogy of dál riata , purports to record his ancestry and that of his immediate descendants adomnán 's work was written in the very late 7th century , probably to mark the centenary of columba 's death it incorporates elements from a lost earlier life of columba , de virtutibus sancti columbae , by cumméne find this may have been written as early as 640 ; neither the elements incorporated from cumméne 's work nor adomnán 's own writings can be treated as simple history the surviving irish annals contain elements of a chronicle kept at iona from the middle of the 7th century onwards , so that these too are retrospective when dealing with áedán 's time in this story , áedán is the twin brother of brandub mac echach , a king of leinster who belonged to the uí cheinnselaig kindred the prophecy of berchán also associates áedán with leinster a lost irish tale , echtra áedáin mac gabráin ( the adventures of áedán son of gabrán ) , appears in a list of works , but its contents are unknown he also appears in the tale compert mongáin áedán additionally appears in a variety of welsh sources , making him one of the few non-britons to figure in welsh tradition though this triad , like the bonedd gwŷr y gogledd , flips father and son 's names as gauran map aedan , bromwich p this may point to an otherwise lost tradition concerning one of áedán 's sea expeditions , such as to orkney or the isle of man áedán was the chief king in dál riata , ruling over lesser tribal kings according to the senchus , dál riata was divided into three sub-kingdoms in the 7th century , each ruled by a kin group named for their eponymous founder bannerman , pp 47–49 and 108–118 ; charles-edwards , pp details of the irish part of the kingdom are less clear looking outward , dál riata 's neighbours in north britain were the picts and the britons of the hen ogledd , the brittonic-speaking parts of what is now northern england and southern lowland scotland in ireland , dál riata formed part of ulster , ruled by báetán mac cairill of the dál fiatach the other major grouping in ulster consisted of the disunited tribes of the cruithne , later known as the dál naraidi the most important cruithne king in áedán 's time was fiachnae mac báetáin of the uí néill kings , áed mac ainmuirech of the cenél conaill , columba 's first cousin once removed , was the most important during áedán 's reign adomnán , the senchus fer n-alban and the irish annals record áedán as a son of gabrán mac domangairt ( died c áedán 's brother eoganán is known from adomnán and his death is recorded c but this is generally read as meaning that ioan was a kinsman of the cenél ngabráin , and his grandfather named domnall is not thought to be the same person as áedán 's brother domnall adomnán , iii , 5 and translator 's note 358 ; broun ; byrne , irish kings , p 1–2 ; byrne , irish kings , p áedán 's campaigns on the isle of man have sometimes been confused with the battle against the miathi mentioned by adomnán '' the only recorded battle between áedán and the picts appears to have been fought in circinn , in 599 or after , where áedán was defeated the anglo-saxon chronicle mentions that hering , son of king hussa of bernicia , was present , apparently fighting with áedán 103–104 , notes some textual inconsistencies in the irish sources , and suggests that the '' battle of the saxons '' recorded in the irish annals may not be bede 's '' battle of degsastan '' the names of áedán 's wives are not recorded , but one was said to be brittonic , and another may have been a pictish woman named domelch , if indeed the gartnait son of domelch and gartnait son of áedán are one and the same

in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill the first use in american literature of the concept of immigrants '' melting '' into the receiving culture are found in the writings of j '' in 1845 , ralph waldo emerson , alluding to the development of european civilization out of the medieval dark ages , wrote in his private journal of america as the utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed '' smelting pot '' , but only in 1912 were his remarks first published a magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly : in 1893 , historian frederick jackson turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one american culture the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c reunited with vera and watching the setting sun gilding the statue of liberty , david quixano has a prophetic vision : '' it is the fires of god round his crucible david foresees how the american melting pot will make the nation 's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people : '' here shall they all unite to build the republic of man and the kingdom of god ah , vera , what is the glory of rome and jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back , compared with the glory of america , where all races and nations come to labour and look forward ! '' zangwill thus combined the metaphor of the '' crucible '' or '' melting pot '' with a celebration of the united states as an ideal republic and a new promised land the prophetic words of his jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the statue of liberty allude to emma lazarus 's famous poem the new colossus ( 1883 ) , which celebrated the statue as a symbol of american democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation zangwill concludes his play by wishing , '' peace , peace , to all ye unborn millions , fated to fill this giant continent—the god of our children give you peace '' expressing his hope that through this forging process the '' unborn millions '' who would become america 's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity in terms of immigrants to the united states , the '' melting pot '' process has been equated with americanization , that is , cultural assimilation and acculturation the '' melting pot '' metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities , yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 . whiteness and the melting pot in the united states the melting pot theory of ethnic relations , which sees american identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups , has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of whiteness studies this discipline examines the '' social construction of whiteness '' and highlights the changing ways in which whiteness has been normative to american national identity from the 17th to the 20th century in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , european immigration to the united states became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers many returned to europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot , adopting american lifestyles in the early 20th century , the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration the debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted american society and on how immigrants should be approached higham ( 1955 ) national quotas were established that discouraged immigration from poland , italy and russia , and encouraged immigration from britain , ireland and germany in many states , marriage between whites and non-whites was even prohibited by state law through anti-miscegenation laws as a result , two kinds of '' mixture talk '' developed : by the early 21st century , many white americans celebrated the impact of african-american culture , especially in sports and music , and marriages between white americans and african-americans were becoming much more common white americans long regarded some elements of african-american culture quintessentially '' american '' , while at the same time treating african americans as second-class citizens white appropriation , stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which european immigrants could express themselves as americans , through such traditions as blackface , minstrel shows and later in jazz and in early hollywood cinema , notably in the jazz singer ( 1927 ) unlike other racially stigmatized groups , white immigrants can put on and take off their mask of difference at the time blacks and japanese in the armed forces were still segregated , while chinese and indians were in integrated units historian richard slotkin sees bataan and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the '' melting pot platoon '' , a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s '' an american community that did not yet exist '' , and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image the diversity of american athletes in the olympic games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid-a massive influx of immigrants , as well as american indians ( represented by jim thorpe in 1912 ) and blacks ( represented by jesse owens in 1936 ) american athletes served as cultural ambassadors of american exceptionalism , promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of america as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture journalists and other american analysts of the olympics framed their comments with patriotic nationalism , stressing that the success of u.s the concept of multiculturalism was preceded by the concept of cultural pluralism , which was first developed in the 1910s and 1920s , and became widely popular during the 1940s during and immediately after the first world war , the concept of the melting pot was equated by nativists with complete cultural assimilation towards an anglo-american norm ( '' anglo-conformity '' ) on the part of immigrants , and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the united states in henry ford 's ford english school ( established in 1914 ) , the graduation ceremony for immigrant employees involved symbolically stepping off an immigrant ship and passing through the melting pot , entering at one end in costumes designating their nationality and emerging at the other end in identical suits and waving american flags 299–329 , randolph bourne , who objected to kallen 's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference , envisioned a '' trans-national '' and cosmopolitan america alternate models where immigrants retain their native cultures such as the '' salad bowl '' or the '' symphony '' are more often used by sociologists to describe how cultures and ethnicities mix in the united states nonetheless , the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt , such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language in the 21st century , most second and third- generation descendants of immigrants in the united states continue to assimilate into broader american culture , while american culture itself increasingly incorporates food and music influences of foreign cultures huntington in who are we ? the challenges to america 's national identity , have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day united states culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot , assimilation , and anglo-conformity models this line of thought holds that this american national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from britain , ireland , and germany today in afghanistan , the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring , where different afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in afghanistan today , ultimately replacing the old pashtun identity which stood for afghan in the early years of the state of israel , the term melting pot ( כור היתוך ) , also known as '' ingathering of the exiles '' ( קיבוץ גלויות ) , was not a description of a process , but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures ( see jewish ethnic divisions ) though the majority of russians had slavic-speaking ancestry , different ethnicities were assimilated into the russian melting pot through the period of expansion cultural assimilation cultural diversity cultural pluralism ethnic group hyphenated american interculturalism

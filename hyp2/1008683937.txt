in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill the first use in american literature of the concept of immigrants '' melting '' into the receiving culture are found in the writings of j a magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly : in 1893 , historian frederick jackson turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one american culture in his essay the significance of the frontier in american history , he referred to the '' composite nationality '' of the american people , arguing that the frontier had functioned as a '' crucible '' where '' the immigrants were americanized , liberated and fused into a mixed race , english in neither nationality nor characteristics '' 116 according to some recent findings , the term has been used since the late 18th century the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c , where the immigrant protagonist declared : ; israel zangwill in the melting pot ( 1908 ) , israel zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing the play 's immigrant protagonist david quixano , a russian jew , falls in love with vera , a fellow russian immigrant who is christian but then david discovers that vera is the daughter of the tsarist officer who directed the pogrom that forced him to flee russia horrified , he breaks up with her , betraying his belief in the possibility of transcending religious and ethnic animosities reunited with vera and watching the setting sun gilding the statue of liberty , david quixano has a prophetic vision : '' it is the fires of god round his crucible the prophetic words of his jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the statue of liberty allude to emma lazarus 's famous poem the new colossus ( 1883 ) , which celebrated the statue as a symbol of american democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation '' expressing his hope that through this forging process the '' unborn millions '' who would become america 's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity in terms of immigrants to the united states , the '' melting pot '' process has been equated with americanization , that is , cultural assimilation and acculturation the '' melting pot '' metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities , yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 the melting pot theory of ethnic relations , which sees american identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups , has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of whiteness studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , european immigration to the united states became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers beginning in the 1890s , large numbers of southern and eastern european immigrant groups such as the italians , jews , and poles arrived many returned to europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot , adopting american lifestyles the debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted american society and on how immigrants should be approached intermarriage between euro-american men and native american women has been common since colonial days in the 1920s the nation welcomed celebrities of native american background , especially will rogers and jim thorpe , as well as vice president charles curtis , who had been brought up on a reservation and identified with his indian heritage since world war ii , the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the united states , gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites this film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial american unit at the time blacks and japanese in the armed forces were still segregated , while chinese and indians were in integrated units the first is the discourse of racial harmony representing hawaii as an idyllic racial paradise with no conflict or inequality throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image the diversity of american athletes in the olympic games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid-a massive influx of immigrants , as well as american indians ( represented by jim thorpe in 1912 ) and blacks ( represented by jesse owens in 1936 ) in the 1968 summer olympics in mexico city , two black american athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the u.s american athletes served as cultural ambassadors of american exceptionalism , promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of america as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture the reemergence of olympic melting pot discourse was driven especially by the unprecedented success of african americans , mexican americans , asian americans , and native americans in events traditionally associated with europeans and white north americans such as speed skating and the bobsled melting pot and cultural pluralism the concept of cultural pluralism first emerged in the 1910s and 1920s among intellectual circles out of the debates in the united states over how to approach issues of immigration and national identity they believed that complete cultural assimilation of the immigrants from southern and eastern europe was not a solution to the problem of immigration because intermarriage with these immigrants would endanger the racial purity of anglo-america 299–329 , randolph bourne , who objected to kallen 's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference , envisioned a '' trans-national '' and cosmopolitan america in the united states , where the term melting pot is still commonly used , the ideas of cultural pluralism and multiculturalism have , in some circles , taken precedence over the idea of assimilation since the 1960s , much research in sociology and history has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the united states and other counties the theory of multiculturalism offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including salad bowl theory , or , as it is known in canada , the cultural mosaic in the 21st century , most second and third- generation descendants of immigrants in the united states continue to assimilate into broader american culture , while american culture itself increasingly incorporates food and music influences of foreign cultures huntington in who are we ? the challenges to america 's national identity , have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day united states culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot , assimilation , and anglo-conformity models as with other areas of new settlement such as canada , australia , the united states , brazil , new zealand , the united arab emirates , and singapore , argentina is considered a country of immigrants millions of immigrants also came from france ( notably béarn and the northern basque country ) , germany , switzerland , denmark , sweden , norway , ireland , greece , portugal , finland , russia and the united kingdom afghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot , as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of afghanistan many ethnic groups in afghanistan tolerate each other , while the hazara–pashtun conflict was notable , and often claimed as a shia-sunni conflict instead of ethnic conflict , as this conflict was carried out by the taliban later the expansion of the grand duchy of moscow and later of the russian empire throughout 15th to 20th centuries created a unique melting pot

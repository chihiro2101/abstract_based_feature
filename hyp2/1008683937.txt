in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill the first use in american literature of the concept of immigrants '' melting '' into the receiving culture are found in the writings of j in his letters from an american farmer ( 1782 ) crevecoeur writes , in response to his own question , '' what then is the american , this new man ? '' that the american is one who '' leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners , receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced , the government he obeys , and the new rank he holds here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men , whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world a magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly : in 1893 , historian frederick jackson turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one american culture in his essay the significance of the frontier in american history , he referred to the '' composite nationality '' of the american people , arguing that the frontier had functioned as a '' crucible '' where '' the immigrants were americanized , liberated and fused into a mixed race , english in neither nationality nor characteristics '' in his 1905 travel narrative the american scene , henry james discusses cultural intermixing in new york city as a '' fusion , as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot '' the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c , where the immigrant protagonist declared : ; israel zangwill in the melting pot ( 1908 ) , israel zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing the play 's immigrant protagonist david quixano , a russian jew , falls in love with vera , a fellow russian immigrant who is christian but then david discovers that vera is the daughter of the tsarist officer who directed the pogrom that forced him to flee russia reunited with vera and watching the setting sun gilding the statue of liberty , david quixano has a prophetic vision : '' it is the fires of god round his crucible there she lies , the great melting-pot—listen ! ca n't you hear the roaring and the bubbling ? there gapes her mouth , the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight '' david foresees how the american melting pot will make the nation 's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people : '' here shall they all unite to build the republic of man and the kingdom of god '' expressing his hope that through this forging process the '' unborn millions '' who would become america 's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity in terms of immigrants to the united states , the '' melting pot '' process has been equated with americanization , that is , cultural assimilation and acculturation the '' melting pot '' metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities , yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage thus african-americans are fully culturally integrated into american culture and institutions yet more than a century after the abolition of slavery , intermarriage between african-americans and other ethnicities is much less common than between different white ethnicities , or between white and asian ethnicities intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 . whiteness and the melting pot in the united states the melting pot theory of ethnic relations , which sees american identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups , has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of whiteness studies archdeacon , becoming american ( 1984 ) pp hostility forced them into '' chinatowns '' or ethnic enclaves in the larger cities , where they lived a culture apart and seldom assimilated the debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted american society and on how immigrants should be approached they felt that far too many '' undesirables , '' or in their view , culturally inferior immigrants from southern and eastern europe had already arrived the compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small , and , apart from family reunification , the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time the mixing of whites and blacks , resulting in multiracial children , for which the term '' miscegenation '' was coined in 1863 , was a taboo , and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks but the freedom promised immigrants to make themselves over points to the vacancy , the violence , the deception , and the melancholy at the core of american self-fashioning '' since world war ii , the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the united states , gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites this film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial american unit judy rohrer , '' disrupting the 'melting pot ' : racial discourse in hawai ' i and the naturalization of haole throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image american athletes served as cultural ambassadors of american exceptionalism , promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of america as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture the newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with '' americanization '' , meaning cultural assimilation , by many '' old stock '' americans since the 1960s , much research in sociology and history has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the united states and other counties the theory of multiculturalism offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including salad bowl theory , or , as it is known in canada , the cultural mosaic for example , the french and british governments and populace are currently debating whether islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries mexico has seen a variety of cultural influences over the years , and in its history has adopted a mixed assimilationist/multiculturalist policy in the 16th and 17th centuries , waves of spanish , and to a lesser extent , african and filipino culture became embedded into the fabric of mexican culture due to this large-scale european and arab immigration , argentina 's population more than doubled , although half ended up returning to europe , the middle east or ended up settling in the united states or canada the majority of these european immigrants came from spain and italy mostly , but to a lesser extent , germany , france , and russia the population is descended from three racial groups—native americans , blacks , and whites—that have mingled throughout the nearly 500 years of the country 's history proponents of the melting pot policy asserted that it applied to all newcomers to israel equally ; specifically , that eastern european jews were pressured to discard their yiddish-based culture as ruthlessly as mizrahi jews were pressured to give up the culture which they developed during centuries of life in arab and muslim countries though the majority of russians had slavic-speaking ancestry , different ethnicities were assimilated into the russian melting pot through the period of expansion in 1969 the song '' melting pot '' was released by the uk band blue mink and charted at 3 in the uk singles chart

in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill the first use in american literature of the concept of immigrants '' melting '' into the receiving culture are found in the writings of j in his writing , emerson explicitly welcomed the racial intermixing of whites and non-whites , a highly controversial view during his lifetime a magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly : in 1893 , historian frederick jackson turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one american culture in his essay the significance of the frontier in american history , he referred to the '' composite nationality '' of the american people , arguing that the frontier had functioned as a '' crucible '' where '' the immigrants were americanized , liberated and fused into a mixed race , english in neither nationality nor characteristics '' in his 1905 travel narrative the american scene , henry james discusses cultural intermixing in new york city as a '' fusion , as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot '' 116 according to some recent findings , the term has been used since the late 18th century the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c , where the immigrant protagonist declared : ; israel zangwill in the melting pot ( 1908 ) , israel zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing the play 's immigrant protagonist david quixano , a russian jew , falls in love with vera , a fellow russian immigrant who is christian vera is an idealistic settlement house worker and david is a composer struggling to create an '' american symphony '' to celebrate his adopted homeland there she lies , the great melting-pot—listen ! ca n't you hear the roaring and the bubbling ? there gapes her mouth , the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight '' david foresees how the american melting pot will make the nation 's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people : '' here shall they all unite to build the republic of man and the kingdom of god the prophetic words of his jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the statue of liberty allude to emma lazarus 's famous poem the new colossus ( 1883 ) , which celebrated the statue as a symbol of american democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation the '' melting pot '' metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities , yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage thus african-americans are fully culturally integrated into american culture and institutions intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 . whiteness and the melting pot in the united states the melting pot theory of ethnic relations , which sees american identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups , has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of whiteness studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , european immigration to the united states became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers many returned to europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot , adopting american lifestyles hostility forced them into '' chinatowns '' or ethnic enclaves in the larger cities , where they lived a culture apart and seldom assimilated the compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small , and , apart from family reunification , the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time in the 21st century some 7.5 million americans claim native american ancestry the mixing of whites and blacks , resulting in multiracial children , for which the term '' miscegenation '' was coined in 1863 , was a taboo , and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks as a result , two kinds of '' mixture talk '' developed : by the early 21st century , many white americans celebrated the impact of african-american culture , especially in sports and music , and marriages between white americans and african-americans were becoming much more common since world war ii , the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the united states , gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites historian richard slotkin sees bataan and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the '' melting pot platoon '' , a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s '' an american community that did not yet exist '' , and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation in hawaii , as rohrer ( 2008 ) argues , there are two dominant discourses of racial politics , both focused on '' haole '' ( white people or whiteness in hawaii ) in the islands there is also a competing discourse of discrimination against nonlocals , which contends that '' haoles '' and nonlocal people of color are disrespected and treated unfairly in hawaii rohrer proposes that the question of racial politics be reframed toward consideration of the processes of racialization themselves—toward a new way of thinking about racial politics in hawaii that breaks free of the not racist/racist dyad throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image in the 1968 summer olympics in mexico city , two black american athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the u.s national anthem with a '' black power '' salute that symbolized rejection of assimilation journalists and other american analysts of the olympics framed their comments with patriotic nationalism , stressing that the success of u.s following the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the 2002 winter olympics in salt lake city strongly revived the melting pot image , returning to a bedrock form of american nationalism and patriotism the first world war and the russian revolution caused a '' red scare '' in the us , which also fanned feelings of xenophobia during and immediately after the first world war , the concept of the melting pot was equated by nativists with complete cultural assimilation towards an anglo-american norm ( '' anglo-conformity '' ) on the part of immigrants , and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the united states 299–329 , randolph bourne , who objected to kallen 's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference , envisioned a '' trans-national '' and cosmopolitan america in the united states , where the term melting pot is still commonly used , the ideas of cultural pluralism and multiculturalism have , in some circles , taken precedence over the idea of assimilation nonetheless , the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt , such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language however , brazilian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation , and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life these invasions , however , brought their own racial mixing between diverse populations and the indian subcontinent is considered an exemplary '' melting pot '' ( and not a '' salad bowl '' ) by many geneticists for exactly this reason today the reaction to this doctrine is ambivalent ; some say that it was a necessary measure in the founding years , while others claim that it amounted to cultural oppression assimilation was a way for ethnic minorities to advance their standing within the russian society and state—as individuals or groups schoolhouse rock ! has a song entitled '' the great american melting pot ''

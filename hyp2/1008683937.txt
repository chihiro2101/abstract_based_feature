in the 18th and 19th centuries , the metaphor of a '' crucible '' or '' smelting pot '' was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities , ethnicities and cultures it was used together with concepts of the united states as an ideal republic and a '' city upon a hill '' or new promised land it was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities , cultures and '' races '' ( a term that could encompass nationality , ethnicity and racist views of humanity ) were to blend into a new , virtuous community , and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an american '' new man '' while '' melting '' was in common use the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in 1908 , after the premiere of the play the melting pot by israel zangwill the first use in american literature of the concept of immigrants '' melting '' into the receiving culture are found in the writings of j he becomes an american by being received in the broad lap of our great alma mater here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men , whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world in his writing , emerson explicitly welcomed the racial intermixing of whites and non-whites , a highly controversial view during his lifetime a magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly : in 1893 , historian frederick jackson turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one american culture in his 1905 travel narrative the american scene , henry james discusses cultural intermixing in new york city as a '' fusion , as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot '' the exact term '' melting pot '' came into general usage in the united states after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities , cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name , first performed in washington , d.c , where the immigrant protagonist declared : ; israel zangwill in the melting pot ( 1908 ) , israel zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing the play 's immigrant protagonist david quixano , a russian jew , falls in love with vera , a fellow russian immigrant who is christian vera is an idealistic settlement house worker and david is a composer struggling to create an '' american symphony '' to celebrate his adopted homeland in terms of immigrants to the united states , the '' melting pot '' process has been equated with americanization , that is , cultural assimilation and acculturation the '' melting pot '' metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities , yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage intermarriage between whites and non-whites , and especially african-americans , was a taboo in the united states for a long time , and was illegal in many us states ( see anti-miscegenation laws ) until 1967 . whiteness and the melting pot in the united states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , european immigration to the united states became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers many returned to europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot , adopting american lifestyles the debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted american society and on how immigrants should be approached white americans long regarded some elements of african-american culture quintessentially '' american '' , while at the same time treating african americans as second-class citizens since world war ii , the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the united states , gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites this trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of world war ii , starting with bataan ( 1943 ) historian richard slotkin sees bataan and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the '' melting pot platoon '' , a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s '' an american community that did not yet exist '' , and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation in hawaii , as rohrer ( 2008 ) argues , there are two dominant discourses of racial politics , both focused on '' haole '' ( white people or whiteness in hawaii ) in the islands as negative referents for each other , these discourses work to reinforce one another and are historically linked rohrer proposes that the question of racial politics be reframed toward consideration of the processes of racialization themselves—toward a new way of thinking about racial politics in hawaii that breaks free of the not racist/racist dyad judy rohrer , '' disrupting the 'melting pot ' : racial discourse in hawai ' i and the naturalization of haole throughout the history of the modern olympic games , the theme of the united states as a melting pot has been employed to explain american athletic success , becoming an important aspect of national self-image in the 1968 summer olympics in mexico city , two black american athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the u.s 5 the international aspect of the games allowed the united states to define its pluralistic self-image against the monolithic traditions of other nations american athletes served as cultural ambassadors of american exceptionalism , promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of america as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture melting pot and cultural pluralism the concept of multiculturalism was preceded by the concept of cultural pluralism , which was first developed in the 1910s and 1920s , and became widely popular during the 1940s the concept of cultural pluralism first emerged in the 1910s and 1920s among intellectual circles out of the debates in the united states over how to approach issues of immigration and national identity during and immediately after the first world war , the concept of the melting pot was equated by nativists with complete cultural assimilation towards an anglo-american norm ( '' anglo-conformity '' ) on the part of immigrants , and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the united states the newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with '' americanization '' , meaning cultural assimilation , by many '' old stock '' americans noam pianko , '' 'the true liberalism of zionism ' : horace kallen , jewish nationalism , and the limits of american pluralism , '' american jewish history , december 2008 , vol 299–329 , randolph bourne , who objected to kallen 's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference , envisioned a '' trans-national '' and cosmopolitan america nonetheless , the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt , such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language in the 1990s , political correctness in the united states emphasized that each ethnic and national group has the right to maintain and preserve its cultural distinction and integrity , and that one does not need to assimilate or abandon one 's heritage in order to blend in or merge into the majority anglo-american society in the 21st century , most second and third- generation descendants of immigrants in the united states continue to assimilate into broader american culture , while american culture itself increasingly incorporates food and music influences of foreign cultures huntington in who are we ? the challenges to america 's national identity , have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day united states culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot , assimilation , and anglo-conformity models this line of thought holds that this american national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from britain , ireland , and germany when more recent immigrants from southern and eastern europe brought their various cultures to america at the beginning of the 20th century , they changed the american cultural landscape just very slightly and , for the most part , assimilated into america 's pre-existing culture , which had its origins in northwestern europe afghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot , as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of afghanistan in the pre-spanish era the philippines was the trading nexus of various cultures and eventually became the melting pot of different nations this melting pot of culture continued with the arrival of europeans , mixing their western culture with the nation

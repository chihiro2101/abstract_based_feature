antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls androgens like testosterone and particularly dht are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate when castration is combined with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen like bicalutamide , this strategy is referred to as combined androgen blockade ( also known as complete or maximal androgen blockade ) monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile high-dose estrogen was the first functional antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer it was widely used , but has largely been abandoned for this indication in favor of newer agents with improved safety profiles and fewer feminizing side effects bicalutamide , as well as enzalutamide , have largely replaced the earlier nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and nilutamide , which are now little used the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose , but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal ar antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer in addition , it is notable that prostate cancer is extremely rare in transgender women who have been on feminizing hormone therapy for an extended period of time the antiandrogens chlormadinone acetate and oxendolone and the functional antiandrogens allylestrenol and gestonorone caproate are also approved in some countries for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization ( e.g antiandrogens used for these indications include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , and gnrh modulators they work by opposing the effects of androgens and delaying the development of secondary sexual characteristics and onset of changes in sex drive and function until a more appropriate age antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women all of these conditions are dependent on androgens , and for this reason , antiandrogens are effective in treating them it is commonly seen in women with pcos , and also occurs in women with intersex conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism , and menstrual disturbances , like amenorrhea , are commonly seen as with androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions , the most commonly used antiandrogens in the treatment of hyperandrogenism in women are cyproterone acetate and spironolactone other antiandrogens , like bicalutamide , may be used alternatively nonsteroidal antiandrogens like bicalutamide are also used for this indication there are several different types of antiandrogens , including the following : androgen receptor antagonists : drugs that bind directly to and block the ar these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide the side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective ar antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question in males , the major side effects of antiandrogens are demasculinization and feminization the rates of gynecomastia in men with selective ar antagonist monotherapy have been found to range from 30 to 85 % conversely , the side effects of selective ar antagonists in women are minimal however , antigonadotropic antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism , amenorrhea , and osteoporosis in premenopausal women , among other side effects as such , antiandrogens are teratogens , and women who are pregnant should not be treated with an antiandrogen sards like dimethylcurcumin differ from conventional ar antagonists and ar ntd antagonists in that they may not necessarily bind directly to the ar gnrh modulators , including both gnrh agonists and gnrh antagonists , are powerful antigonadotropins that are able to suppress androgen levels by 95 % in men in addition to spironolactone , chlormadinone acetate and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier , in the 1960s in addition to these three drugs , which have been regarded as first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogens , the second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogens enzalutamide and apalutamide were introduced in 2012 and 2018 , respectively the androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole were first marketed in 1960 and 1977 , respectively , and the newer drug abiraterone acetate was introduced in 2011

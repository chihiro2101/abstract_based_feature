antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls androgens like testosterone and particularly dht are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer , they are not generally curative , and with time , the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate in addition to active treatment of prostate cancer , antiandrogens are effective as prophylaxis ( preventatives ) in reducing the risk of ever developing prostate cancer antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose , but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal ar antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer they are effective because androgens act as growth factors in the prostate gland the antiandrogens chlormadinone acetate and oxendolone and the functional antiandrogens allylestrenol and gestonorone caproate are also approved in some countries for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization ( e.g clascoterone , a topical antiandrogen , is effective for acne in males and may become approved for this indication in the future antiandrogens are used to treat precocious puberty in boys antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women in addition to ar antagonists , oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are effective in treating these conditions , and may be combined with ar antagonists hyperandrogenism is a condition in women in which androgen levels are excessively and abnormally high it is commonly seen in women with pcos , and also occurs in women with intersex conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism , and menstrual disturbances , like amenorrhea , are commonly seen other antiandrogens , like bicalutamide , may be used alternatively besides estrogens , the main antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose are cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , and gnrh modulators nonsteroidal antiandrogens like bicalutamide are also used for this indication in addition to use in transgender women , antiandrogens , mainly gnrh modulators , are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate , a few other progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal hrt including dienogest , drospirenone , medrogestone , nomegestrol acetate , promegestone , and trimegestone also have varying degrees of ar antagonistic activity androgen synthesis inhibitors : drugs that directly inhibit the enzyme biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or dht a number of other antiandrogens , including cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , medrogestone , flutamide , nilutamide , and bifluranol , are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis an example is the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate , which is a potent ar antagonist , a potent progestogen and hence antigonadotropin , a weak glucocorticoid and hence anticorticotropin , and a weak androgen synthesis inhibitor the side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective ar antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question as another example , the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate and spironolactone possess off-target actions including progestogenic , antimineralocorticoid , and/or glucocorticoid activity in addition to their antiandrogen activity , and these off-target activities can result in additional side effects conversely , the side effects of selective ar antagonists in women are minimal in contrast to steroidal ar antagonists , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are silent antagonists of the ar and do not activate the receptor combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol have been found to increase circulating shbg levels by 2- to 4-fold in women and to reduce free testosterone concentrations by 40 to 80 % antiandrogens can be divided into several different types based on chemical structure , including steroidal antiandrogens , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and peptides there has been much interest and effort in the development of topical ar antagonists to treat androgen-dependent conditions like acne and pattern hair loss in males androgen insensitivity syndrome antiandrogens in the environment

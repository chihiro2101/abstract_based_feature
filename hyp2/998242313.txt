antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate enzalutamide , apalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer high-dose estrogen was the first functional antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety bicalutamide , as well as enzalutamide , have largely replaced the earlier nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and nilutamide , which are now little used the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose , but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal ar antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization ( e.g antiandrogens used for these indications include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , and gnrh modulators antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women bicalutamide , which has a relatively minimal risk of hepatotoxicity , has been evaluated for the treatment of hirsutism and found effective similarly to flutamide and may be used instead of it in addition to ar antagonists , oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are effective in treating these conditions , and may be combined with ar antagonists androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism , and menstrual disturbances , like amenorrhea , are commonly seen other antiandrogens , like bicalutamide , may be used alternatively in addition to use in transgender women , antiandrogens , mainly gnrh modulators , are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate , a few other progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal hrt including dienogest , drospirenone , medrogestone , nomegestrol acetate , promegestone , and trimegestone also have varying degrees of ar antagonistic activity androgen synthesis inhibitors : drugs that directly inhibit the enzyme biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or dht a number of other antiandrogens , including cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , medrogestone , flutamide , nilutamide , and bifluranol , are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis an example is the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate , which is a potent ar antagonist , a potent progestogen and hence antigonadotropin , a weak glucocorticoid and hence anticorticotropin , and a weak androgen synthesis inhibitor the side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective ar antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question for instance , whereas antigonadotropic antiandrogens like gnrh modulators and cyproterone acetate are associated with pronounced sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis in men , selective ar antagonists like bicalutamide are not associated with osteoporosis and have been associated with only minimal sexual dysfunction in males , the major side effects of antiandrogens are demasculinization and feminization these include , to varying extents , cyproterone acetate , flutamide , nilutamide , bicalutamide , aminoglutethimide , and ketoconazole steroidal ar antagonists are structurally related to steroid hormones like testosterone and progesterone , whereas nonsteroidal ar antagonists are not steroids and are structurally distinct in contrast , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are selective for the ar and have no off-target hormonal activity in contrast to steroidal ar antagonists , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are silent antagonists of the ar and do not activate the receptor whereas conventional ar antagonists bind to the lbd of the ar and competitively displace androgens , thereby preventing them from activating the receptor , ar ntd antagonists bind covalently to the ntd of the ar and prevent protein–protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcription ( biology ) high-dose estrogens are able to suppress androgen levels to castrate levels in men similarly to gnrh modulators , while high-dose progestogens are able to suppress androgen levels by up to approximately 70 to 80 % in men the beneficial effects of androgen deprivation via surgical castration or high-dose estrogen therapy on prostate cancer were discovered in 1941 in addition to spironolactone , chlormadinone acetate and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier , in the 1960s the androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole were first marketed in 1960 and 1977 , respectively , and the newer drug abiraterone acetate was introduced in 2011

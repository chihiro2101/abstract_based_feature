antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls androgens like testosterone and particularly dht are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer in accordance , therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland , referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy , are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer , they are not generally curative , and with time , the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate enzalutamide , apalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile high-dose estrogen was the first functional antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate in addition to active treatment of prostate cancer , antiandrogens are effective as prophylaxis ( preventatives ) in reducing the risk of ever developing prostate cancer antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose , but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal ar antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia , a condition in which the prostate becomes enlarged and this results in urinary obstruction and discomfort the antiandrogens chlormadinone acetate and oxendolone and the functional antiandrogens allylestrenol and gestonorone caproate are also approved in some countries for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness in accordance , antiandrogens are used in the treatment of conditions of sexual deviance such as hypersexuality ( excessively high sex drive ) and paraphilias ( atypical and sometimes societally unacceptable sexual interests ) like pedophilia ( sexual attraction to children ) they have been used to decrease sex drive in sex offenders so as to reduce the likelihood of recidivism ( repeat offenses ) antiandrogens used for these indications include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , and gnrh modulators antiandrogens are used to treat precocious puberty in boys antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women in addition to ar antagonists , oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are effective in treating these conditions , and may be combined with ar antagonists as with androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions , the most commonly used antiandrogens in the treatment of hyperandrogenism in women are cyproterone acetate and spironolactone besides estrogens , the main antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose are cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , and gnrh modulators nonsteroidal antiandrogens like bicalutamide are also used for this indication in addition to use in transgender women , antiandrogens , mainly gnrh modulators , are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy there are several different types of antiandrogens , including the following : androgen receptor antagonists : drugs that bind directly to and block the ar aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate , a few other progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal hrt including dienogest , drospirenone , medrogestone , nomegestrol acetate , promegestone , and trimegestone also have varying degrees of ar antagonistic activity the side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective ar antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question as another example , the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate and spironolactone possess off-target actions including progestogenic , antimineralocorticoid , and/or glucocorticoid activity in addition to their antiandrogen activity , and these off-target activities can result in additional side effects in addition , antiandrogens can cause infertility , osteoporosis , hot flashes , sexual dysfunction ( including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction ) , depression , fatigue , anemia , and decreased ejaculation volume in males however , antigonadotropic antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism , amenorrhea , and osteoporosis in premenopausal women , among other side effects steroidal ar antagonists are structurally related to steroid hormones like testosterone and progesterone , whereas nonsteroidal ar antagonists are not steroids and are structurally distinct in contrast to steroidal ar antagonists , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are silent antagonists of the ar and do not activate the receptor in addition to spironolactone , chlormadinone acetate and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier , in the 1960s for example , the progestogen and hence antigonadotropin medroxyprogesterone acetate is sometimes described as a steroidal antiandrogen , even though it is not an antagonist of the ar antiandrogens , such as cyproterone acetate , have been studied for potential use as male hormonal contraceptives

antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls androgens like testosterone and particularly dht are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer , they are not generally curative , and with time , the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile high-dose estrogen was the first functional antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety the earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate in addition to active treatment of prostate cancer , antiandrogens are effective as prophylaxis ( preventatives ) in reducing the risk of ever developing prostate cancer 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness this condition is generally caused by androgens , so antiandrogens can slow or halt its progression systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization ( e.g androgens increase sex drive , and for this reason , antiandrogens are able to reduce sex drive in men antiandrogens used for these indications include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , and gnrh modulators antiandrogens are used to treat precocious puberty in boys antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole in addition to ar antagonists , oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are effective in treating these conditions , and may be combined with ar antagonists androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism , and menstrual disturbances , like amenorrhea , are commonly seen as with androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions , the most commonly used antiandrogens in the treatment of hyperandrogenism in women are cyproterone acetate and spironolactone other antiandrogens , like bicalutamide , may be used alternatively besides estrogens , the main antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose are cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , and gnrh modulators nonsteroidal antiandrogens like bicalutamide are also used for this indication there are several different types of antiandrogens , including the following : androgen receptor antagonists : drugs that bind directly to and block the ar these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide examples include the cyp17a1 inhibitors ketoconazole , abiraterone acetate , and seviteronel , the cyp11a1 ( p450scc ) inhibitor aminoglutethimide , and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride , dutasteride , epristeride , alfatradiol , and saw palmetto extract ( serenoa repens ) a number of other antiandrogens , including cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , medrogestone , flutamide , nilutamide , and bifluranol , are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis these side effects include mastodynia and gynecomastia ( breast development/enlargement ) , reduced body hair growth/density , decreased muscle mass and strength , feminine changes in fat mass and distribution , and reduced penile length and testicle size however , antigonadotropic antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism , amenorrhea , and osteoporosis in premenopausal women , among other side effects steroidal ar antagonists are structurally related to steroid hormones like testosterone and progesterone , whereas nonsteroidal ar antagonists are not steroids and are structurally distinct in contrast , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are selective for the ar and have no off-target hormonal activity although they are described as antiandrogens and indeed show only such effects generally , most or all steroidal ar antagonists are actually not silent antagonists of the ar but rather are weak partial agonists and are able to activate the receptor in the absence of more potent ar agonists like testosterone and dht in contrast to steroidal ar antagonists , nonsteroidal ar antagonists are silent antagonists of the ar and do not activate the receptor similarly to ar ntd antagonists , it is thought that sards may have greater efficacy than conventional ar antagonists , and for this reason , they are under investigation for the treatment of prostate cancer gnrh modulators , including both gnrh agonists and gnrh antagonists , are powerful antigonadotropins that are able to suppress androgen levels by 95 % in men the term antiandrogen is generally used to refer specifically to ar antagonists , as described by dorfman ( 1970 ) : however , in spite of the above , the term may also be used to describe functional antiandrogens like androgen synthesis inhibitors and antigonadotropins , including even estrogens and progestogens antiandrogens such as bicalutamide , enzalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are under investigation for the potential treatment of breast cancer , including ar-expressing triple-negative breast cancer and other types of ar-expressing breast cancer

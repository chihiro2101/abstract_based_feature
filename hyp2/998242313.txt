antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females they are used to treat men with prostate cancer , benign prostatic hyperplasia , pattern hair loss , hypersexuality , paraphilias , and priapism , as well as boys with precocious puberty in women and girls , antiandrogens are used to treat acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and hyperandrogenism antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer , they are not generally curative , and with time , the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective the most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration ( with a gnrh modulator or orchiectomy ) , nonsteroidal antiandrogens , and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate when castration is combined with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen like bicalutamide , this strategy is referred to as combined androgen blockade ( also known as complete or maximal androgen blockade ) enzalutamide , apalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile high-dose estrogen was the first functional antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer , but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens , which are newer and have greater effectiveness , tolerability , and safety bicalutamide , as well as enzalutamide , have largely replaced the earlier nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and nilutamide , which are now little used in addition to active treatment of prostate cancer , antiandrogens are effective as prophylaxis ( preventatives ) in reducing the risk of ever developing prostate cancer antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose , but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal ar antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer the antiandrogens chlormadinone acetate and oxendolone and the functional antiandrogens allylestrenol and gestonorone caproate are also approved in some countries for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride , dutasteride , and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal ar antagonist topilutamide ( fluridil ) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss , also known as scalp hair loss or baldness systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization ( e.g they have been used to decrease sex drive in sex offenders so as to reduce the likelihood of recidivism ( repeat offenses ) antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate , medroxyprogesterone acetate , gnrh modulators , spironolactone , bicalutamide , and ketoconazole antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair diseases including acne , seborrhea , hidradenitis suppurativa , hirsutism , and pattern hair loss in women bicalutamide , which has a relatively minimal risk of hepatotoxicity , has been evaluated for the treatment of hirsutism and found effective similarly to flutamide and may be used instead of it hyperandrogenism is a condition in women in which androgen levels are excessively and abnormally high androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism , and menstrual disturbances , like amenorrhea , are commonly seen besides estrogens , the main antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose are cyproterone acetate , spironolactone , and gnrh modulators in addition to use in transgender women , antiandrogens , mainly gnrh modulators , are used as puberty blockers to prevent puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy there are several different types of antiandrogens , including the following : androgen receptor antagonists : drugs that bind directly to and block the ar these drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate , megestrol acetate , chlormadinone acetate , spironolactone , oxendolone , and osaterone acetate ( veterinary ) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide , bicalutamide , nilutamide , topilutamide , enzalutamide , and apalutamide aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate , a few other progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal hrt including dienogest , drospirenone , medrogestone , nomegestrol acetate , promegestone , and trimegestone also have varying degrees of ar antagonistic activity androgen synthesis inhibitors : drugs that directly inhibit the enzyme biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or dht antigonadotropins : drugs that suppress the gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( gnrh ) -induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production an example is the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate , which is a potent ar antagonist , a potent progestogen and hence antigonadotropin , a weak glucocorticoid and hence anticorticotropin , and a weak androgen synthesis inhibitor in males , the major side effects of antiandrogens are demasculinization and feminization in addition , antiandrogens can cause infertility , osteoporosis , hot flashes , sexual dysfunction ( including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction ) , depression , fatigue , anemia , and decreased ejaculation volume in males however , antigonadotropic antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism , amenorrhea , and osteoporosis in premenopausal women , among other side effects ar ntd antagonists are under investigation for the potential treatment of prostate cancer , and it is thought that they may have greater efficacy as antiandrogens relative to conventional ar antagonists sards like dimethylcurcumin differ from conventional ar antagonists and ar ntd antagonists in that they may not necessarily bind directly to the ar in addition to spironolactone , chlormadinone acetate and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier , in the 1960s the term antiandrogen is generally used to refer specifically to ar antagonists , as described by dorfman ( 1970 ) : however , in spite of the above , the term may also be used to describe functional antiandrogens like androgen synthesis inhibitors and antigonadotropins , including even estrogens and progestogens there has been much interest and effort in the development of topical ar antagonists to treat androgen-dependent conditions like acne and pattern hair loss in males antiandrogens such as bicalutamide , enzalutamide , and abiraterone acetate are under investigation for the potential treatment of breast cancer , including ar-expressing triple-negative breast cancer and other types of ar-expressing breast cancer

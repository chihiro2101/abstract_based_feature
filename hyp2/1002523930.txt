giovanni was born at mirandola , near modena , the youngest son of gianfrancesco i pico , lord of mirandola and count of concordia , by his wife giulia , daughter of feltrino boiardo , count of scandiano the family had long dwelt in the castle of mirandola ( duchy of modena ) , which had become independent in the fourteenth century and had received in 1414 from the holy roman emperor sigismund the fief of concordia the pico della mirandola were closely related to the sforza , gonzaga and este dynasties , and giovanni 's siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of corsica , ferrara , bologna , and forlì born twenty-three years into his parents ' marriage , giovanni had two much older brothers , both of whom outlived him : count galeotto i continued the dynasty , while antonio became a general in the imperial army giovanni 's maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the italian renaissance his cousin and contemporary was the poet matteo maria boiardo , who grew up under the influence of his own uncle , the florentine gaius maecenas and scholar-poet tito vespasiano strozzi a precocious child with an exceptional memory , giovanni was schooled in latin and possibly greek at a very early age at the sudden death of his mother three years later , pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the university of ferrara during a brief trip to florence , he met angelo poliziano , the courtly poet girolamo benivieni , and probably the young dominican friar girolamo savonarola del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts from hebrew into latin for pico , as he would continue to do for a number of years pico also wrote sonnets in latin and italian which , because of the influence of savonarola , he destroyed at the end of his life he spent the next four years either at home , or visiting humanism centres elsewhere in italy in 1485 , he travelled to the university of paris , the most important centre in europe for scholastic philosophy and theology , and a hotbed of secular averroism it was probably in paris that giovanni began his 900 theses and conceived the idea of defending them in public debate the first was when he returned to settle for a time in florence in november 1484 and met lorenzo de ' medici and marsilio ficino pico appears to have charmed both men , and despite ficino 's philosophical differences , he was convinced of their saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival soon after this stay in florence , pico was travelling on his way to rome where he intended to publish his 900 theses and prepare for a congress of scholars from all over europe to debate them stopping in arezzo he became embroiled in a love affair with the wife of one of lorenzo de ' medici 's cousins , which almost cost him his life giovanni attempted to run off with the woman , but he was caught , wounded and thrown into prison by her husband the incident is representative of pico 's often audacious temperament and of the loyalty and affection he nevertheless could inspire pico spent several months in perugia and nearby fratta , recovering from his injuries 1510 ) , who argued that the study and mastery of magic was to be regarded as the final stage of one 's intellectual and spiritual education as a result , he became the founder of the tradition known as christian kabbalah , which went on to be a central part of early modern western esotericism although he was a product of the studia humanitatis , pico was constitutionally an eclectic , and in some respects he represented a reaction against the exaggerations of pure humanism , defending what he believed to be the best of the medieval and islamic commentators , such as averroes and avicenna , on aristotle in a famous long letter to ermolao barbaro in 1485 it was always pico 's aim to reconcile the schools of plato and aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts it was perhaps , for this reason , his friends called him '' princeps concordiae '' , or '' prince of harmony '' ( a pun on prince of concordia , one of his family 's holdings ) similarly , pico believed that an educated person should also study hebrew and talmudic sources , and the hermetics , because he thought they represented the same concept of god that is seen in the old testament , but in different words he finished his '' oration on the dignity of man '' to accompany his 900 theses and traveled to rome to continue his plan to defend them he had them published together in december 1486 as '' conclusiones philosophicae , cabalasticae et theologicae '' , and offered to pay the expenses of any scholars who came to rome to debate them publicly according to farmer , pico may have been expecting quite literally that '' his vatican debate would end with the four horsemen of the apocalypse crashing through the roman skies '' 57 in february 1487 , pope innocent viii halted the proposed debate , and established a commission to review the orthodoxy of the 900 theses pico fled to france in 1488 , where he was arrested by philip ii , duke of savoy , at the demand of the papal nuncios , and imprisoned at vincennes in it , pico acidly condemned the deterministic practices of the astrologers of his day in 1494 , at the age of 31 , pico died under mysterious circumstances along with his friend poliziano ficino wrote : in 2007 , the bodies of poliziano and pico were exhumed from the san_marco , _florence in florence to establish the causes

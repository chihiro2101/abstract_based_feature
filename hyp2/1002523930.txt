giovanni was born at mirandola , near modena , the youngest son of gianfrancesco i pico , lord of mirandola and count of concordia , by his wife giulia , daughter of feltrino boiardo , count of scandiano the family had long dwelt in the castle of mirandola ( duchy of modena ) , which had become independent in the fourteenth century and had received in 1414 from the holy roman emperor sigismund the fief of concordia the pico della mirandola were closely related to the sforza , gonzaga and este dynasties , and giovanni 's siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of corsica , ferrara , bologna , and forl√¨ born twenty-three years into his parents ' marriage , giovanni had two much older brothers , both of whom outlived him : count galeotto i continued the dynasty , while antonio became a general in the imperial army the pico family would reign as dukes until mirandola , an ally of louis xiv of france , was conquered by his rival , joseph i , holy roman emperor , in 1708 and annexed to modena by duke rinaldo d'este , the exiled male line becoming extinct in 1747 giovanni 's maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the italian renaissance a precocious child with an exceptional memory , giovanni was schooled in latin and possibly greek at a very early age intended for the church by his mother , he was named a papal protonotary ( probably honorary ) at the age of ten and in 1477 he went to bologna to study canon law during a brief trip to florence , he met angelo poliziano , the courtly poet girolamo benivieni , and probably the young dominican friar girolamo savonarola from 1480 to 1482 , he continued his studies at the university of padua , a major center of aristotelianism in italy already proficient in latin and greek , he studied hebrew and arabic in padua with elia del medigo , a jewish averroist , and read aramaic manuscripts with him as well del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts from hebrew into latin for pico , as he would continue to do for a number of years pico also wrote sonnets in latin and italian which , because of the influence of savonarola , he destroyed at the end of his life he spent the next four years either at home , or visiting humanism centres elsewhere in italy in 1485 , he travelled to the university of paris , the most important centre in europe for scholastic philosophy and theology , and a hotbed of secular averroism it was probably in paris that giovanni began his 900 theses and conceived the idea of defending them in public debate pico appears to have charmed both men , and despite ficino 's philosophical differences , he was convinced of their saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival stopping in arezzo he became embroiled in a love affair with the wife of one of lorenzo de ' medici 's cousins , which almost cost him his life the incident is representative of pico 's often audacious temperament and of the loyalty and affection he nevertheless could inspire pico spent several months in perugia and nearby fratta , recovering from his injuries '' it was also in perugia that pico was introduced to the mystical hebrew kabbalah , which fascinated him , as did the late classical hermetic writers , such as hermes trismegistus the kabbalah and hermetica were thought in pico 's time to be as ancient as the old testament as a result , he became the founder of the tradition known as christian kabbalah , which went on to be a central part of early modern western esotericism hanegraaff p.59 pico based his ideas chiefly on plato , as did his teacher , marsilio ficino , but retained a deep respect for aristotle it was always pico 's aim to reconcile the schools of plato and aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts he finished his '' oration on the dignity of man '' to accompany his 900 theses and traveled to rome to continue his plan to defend them according to farmer , pico may have been expecting quite literally that '' his vatican debate would end with the four horsemen of the apocalypse crashing through the roman skies '' when the pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript , he set up an inquisitorial tribunal , forcing pico to renounce the apologia , in addition to his condemned theses , which he agreed to do pico fled to france in 1488 , where he was arrested by philip ii , duke of savoy , at the demand of the papal nuncios , and imprisoned at vincennes but he was not cleared of the papal censures and restrictions until 1493 , after the accession of alexander vi ( rodrigo borgia ) to the papacy it was at pico 's persuasion that lorenzo invited savonarola to florence he settled in a villa near fiesole prepared for him by lorenzo , where he wrote and published the heptaplus id est de dei creatoris opere ( 1489 ) and de ente et uno ( of being and unity , 1491 ) after the death of lorenzo de ' medici , in 1492 , pico moved to ferrara , although he continued to visit florence nevertheless , pico became a follower of savonarola in 1494 , at the age of 31 , pico died under mysterious circumstances along with his friend poliziano '' medici philosopher 's mysterious death is solved '' the daily telegraph they also included 72 theses describing what pico believed to be a complete system of physics mirandola was described as a man who spoke 22 languages , was deeply read in philosophy , and someone who made no enemies campanini with a text on pico by giulio busi , in the kabbalistic library of giovanni

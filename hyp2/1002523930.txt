giovanni was born at mirandola , near modena , the youngest son of gianfrancesco i pico , lord of mirandola and count of concordia , by his wife giulia , daughter of feltrino boiardo , count of scandiano the family had long dwelt in the castle of mirandola ( duchy of modena ) , which had become independent in the fourteenth century and had received in 1414 from the holy roman emperor sigismund the fief of concordia the pico della mirandola were closely related to the sforza , gonzaga and este dynasties , and giovanni 's siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of corsica , ferrara , bologna , and forlì giovanni 's maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the italian renaissance giovanni had a paradoxical relationship with his nephew gianfrancesco pico della mirandola , who was a great admirer of his uncle , yet published examen vanitatis doctrinae gentium ( 1520 ) in opposition to the '' ancient wisdom narrative '' espoused by giovanni , described by historian charles b a precocious child with an exceptional memory , giovanni was schooled in latin and possibly greek at a very early age at the sudden death of his mother three years later , pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the university of ferrara already proficient in latin and greek , he studied hebrew and arabic in padua with elia del medigo , a jewish averroist , and read aramaic manuscripts with him as well del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts from hebrew into latin for pico , as he would continue to do for a number of years in 1485 , he travelled to the university of paris , the most important centre in europe for scholastic philosophy and theology , and a hotbed of secular averroism it was an astrology auspicious day that ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of plato from greek into latin , under lorenzo 's enthusiastic patronage pico appears to have charmed both men , and despite ficino 's philosophical differences , he was convinced of their saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival lorenzo would support and protect pico until his death in 1492 soon after this stay in florence , pico was travelling on his way to rome where he intended to publish his 900 theses and prepare for a congress of scholars from all over europe to debate them the incident is representative of pico 's often audacious temperament and of the loyalty and affection he nevertheless could inspire '' it was also in perugia that pico was introduced to the mystical hebrew kabbalah , which fascinated him , as did the late classical hermetic writers , such as hermes trismegistus this contact , initiated as a result of christian interest in probing the ancient wisdom found in jewish mystical sources , resulted in unprecedented mutual influence between jewish and christian renaissance thought the most original of pico 's 900 theses concerned the kabbalah as a result , he became the founder of the tradition known as christian kabbalah , which went on to be a central part of early modern western esotericism pico 's approach to different philosophies was one of extreme syncretism , placing them in parallel , it has been claimed , rather than attempting to describe a developmental history it was always pico 's aim to reconcile the schools of plato and aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts he finished his '' oration on the dignity of man '' to accompany his 900 theses and traveled to rome to continue his plan to defend them according to farmer , pico may have been expecting quite literally that '' his vatican debate would end with the four horsemen of the apocalypse crashing through the roman skies '' when the pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript , he set up an inquisitorial tribunal , forcing pico to renounce the apologia , in addition to his condemned theses , which he agreed to do pico fled to france in 1488 , where he was arrested by philip ii , duke of savoy , at the demand of the papal nuncios , and imprisoned at vincennes he settled in a villa near fiesole prepared for him by lorenzo , where he wrote and published the heptaplus id est de dei creatoris opere ( 1489 ) and de ente et uno ( of being and unity , 1491 ) it was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work , the disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium ( treatise against predictive astrology ) , which was not published until after his death nevertheless , pico became a follower of savonarola in 1494 , at the age of 31 , pico died under mysterious circumstances along with his friend poliziano ficino wrote : in 2007 , the bodies of poliziano and pico were exhumed from the san_marco , _florence in florence to establish the causes of their deaths in the oratio de hominis dignitate ( oration on the dignity of man , 1486 ) , pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a neoplatonic framework pico believed in universal reconciliation , as one of his 900 theses was '' a mortal sin of finite duration is not deserving of eternal but only of temporal punishment ; '' it was among the theses pronounced heretical by pope innocent viii in his bull of 4 august 1487 a portion of his disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem was published in bologna after his death in this book pico presents arguments against the practice of astrology that have had enormous resonance for centuries , up to our own time pico 's antagonism to astrology seems to derive mainly from the conflict of astrology with christian notions of free will but pico 's arguments moved beyond the objections of ficino , who was himself an astrologer busi , the

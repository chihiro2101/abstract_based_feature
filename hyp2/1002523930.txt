giovanni was born at mirandola , near modena , the youngest son of gianfrancesco i pico , lord of mirandola and count of concordia , by his wife giulia , daughter of feltrino boiardo , count of scandiano the family had long dwelt in the castle of mirandola ( duchy of modena ) , which had become independent in the fourteenth century and had received in 1414 from the holy roman emperor sigismund the fief of concordia mirandola was a small autonomous county ( later , a duchy ) in emilia , near ferrara the pico della mirandola were closely related to the sforza , gonzaga and este dynasties , and giovanni 's siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of corsica , ferrara , bologna , and forlì giovanni 's maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the italian renaissance a precocious child with an exceptional memory , giovanni was schooled in latin and possibly greek at a very early age at the sudden death of his mother three years later , pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the university of ferrara from 1480 to 1482 , he continued his studies at the university of padua , a major center of aristotelianism in italy already proficient in latin and greek , he studied hebrew and arabic in padua with elia del medigo , a jewish averroist , and read aramaic manuscripts with him as well del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts from hebrew into latin for pico , as he would continue to do for a number of years pico also wrote sonnets in latin and italian which , because of the influence of savonarola , he destroyed at the end of his life he spent the next four years either at home , or visiting humanism centres elsewhere in italy the first was when he returned to settle for a time in florence in november 1484 and met lorenzo de ' medici and marsilio ficino soon after this stay in florence , pico was travelling on his way to rome where he intended to publish his 900 theses and prepare for a congress of scholars from all over europe to debate them the incident is representative of pico 's often audacious temperament and of the loyalty and affection he nevertheless could inspire of esdras , of zoroaster and of melchior , oracles of the magi , which contain a brief and dry interpretation of chaldean philosophy , but full of mystery this contact , initiated as a result of christian interest in probing the ancient wisdom found in jewish mystical sources , resulted in unprecedented mutual influence between jewish and christian renaissance thought as a result , he became the founder of the tradition known as christian kabbalah , which went on to be a central part of early modern western esotericism hanegraaff p.59 pico based his ideas chiefly on plato , as did his teacher , marsilio ficino , but retained a deep respect for aristotle it was perhaps , for this reason , his friends called him '' princeps concordiae '' , or '' prince of harmony '' ( a pun on prince of concordia , one of his family 's holdings ) he finished his '' oration on the dignity of man '' to accompany his 900 theses and traveled to rome to continue his plan to defend them when the pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript , he set up an inquisitorial tribunal , forcing pico to renounce the apologia , in addition to his condemned theses , which he agreed to do the pope condemned 900 theses as : this was the first time that a printed book had been banned by the church , and nearly all copies were burned but he was not cleared of the papal censures and restrictions until 1493 , after the accession of alexander vi ( rodrigo borgia ) to the papacy he settled in a villa near fiesole prepared for him by lorenzo , where he wrote and published the heptaplus id est de dei creatoris opere ( 1489 ) and de ente et uno ( of being and unity , 1491 ) it was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work , the disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium ( treatise against predictive astrology ) , which was not published until after his death determined to become a monk , he dismissed his former interest in egyptian and chaldean texts , destroyed his own poetry and gave away his fortune ficino wrote : in 2007 , the bodies of poliziano and pico were exhumed from the san_marco , _florence in florence to establish the causes of their deaths forensic tests showed that both poliziano and pico likely died of arsenic poisoning , possibly at the order of lorenzo 's successor , piero de ' medici in the oratio de hominis dignitate ( oration on the dignity of man , 1486 ) , pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a neoplatonic framework the oration also served as an introduction to pico 's 900 theses , which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge , and hence a model for mankind 's ascent of the chain of being the 900 theses are a good example of humanist syncretism , because pico combined platonism , neoplatonism , aristotelianism , hermeticism and kabbalah pico 's de animae immortalitate ( paris , 1541 ) , and other works , developed the doctrine that man 's possession of an immortal soul freed him from the hierarchical stasis new schaff-herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge , vol the many editions of his entire works in the

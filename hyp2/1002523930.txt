giovanni was born at mirandola , near modena , the youngest son of gianfrancesco i pico , lord of mirandola and count of concordia , by his wife giulia , daughter of feltrino boiardo , count of scandiano the family had long dwelt in the castle of mirandola ( duchy of modena ) , which had become independent in the fourteenth century and had received in 1414 from the holy roman emperor sigismund the fief of concordia the pico della mirandola were closely related to the sforza , gonzaga and este dynasties , and giovanni 's siblings wed the descendants of the hereditary rulers of corsica , ferrara , bologna , and forlì giovanni 's maternal family was singularly distinguished in the arts and scholarship of the italian renaissance intended for the church by his mother , he was named a papal protonotary ( probably honorary ) at the age of ten and in 1477 he went to bologna to study canon law at the sudden death of his mother three years later , pico renounced canon law and began to study philosophy at the university of ferrara already proficient in latin and greek , he studied hebrew and arabic in padua with elia del medigo , a jewish averroist , and read aramaic manuscripts with him as well del medigo also translated judaic manuscripts from hebrew into latin for pico , as he would continue to do for a number of years he spent the next four years either at home , or visiting humanism centres elsewhere in italy in 1485 , he travelled to the university of paris , the most important centre in europe for scholastic philosophy and theology , and a hotbed of secular averroism it was probably in paris that giovanni began his 900 theses and conceived the idea of defending them in public debate the first was when he returned to settle for a time in florence in november 1484 and met lorenzo de ' medici and marsilio ficino it was an astrology auspicious day that ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of plato from greek into latin , under lorenzo 's enthusiastic patronage pico spent several months in perugia and nearby fratta , recovering from his injuries of esdras , of zoroaster and of melchior , oracles of the magi , which contain a brief and dry interpretation of chaldean philosophy , but full of mystery '' it was also in perugia that pico was introduced to the mystical hebrew kabbalah , which fascinated him , as did the late classical hermetic writers , such as hermes trismegistus pico 's '' tutor '' in kabbalah was yohanan alemanno ( 1435/8-c as a result , he became the founder of the tradition known as christian kabbalah , which went on to be a central part of early modern western esotericism hanegraaff p.59 pico based his ideas chiefly on plato , as did his teacher , marsilio ficino , but retained a deep respect for aristotle it was always pico 's aim to reconcile the schools of plato and aristotle since he believed they used different words to express the same concepts it was perhaps , for this reason , his friends called him '' princeps concordiae '' , or '' prince of harmony '' ( a pun on prince of concordia , one of his family 's holdings ) after emerging victorious at the culmination of the debate , pico planned not only on the symbolic acquiescence of the pagan sages , but also the conversion of jews as they realised that jesus was the true secret of their traditions 57 in february 1487 , pope innocent viii halted the proposed debate , and established a commission to review the orthodoxy of the 900 theses although pico answered the charges against them , thirteen theses were condemned pico agreed in writing to retract them , but he did not change his mind about their validity when the pope was apprised of the circulation of this manuscript , he set up an inquisitorial tribunal , forcing pico to renounce the apologia , in addition to his condemned theses , which he agreed to do the pope condemned 900 theses as : this was the first time that a printed book had been banned by the church , and nearly all copies were burned it was at pico 's persuasion that lorenzo invited savonarola to florence it was here that he also wrote his other most celebrated work , the disputationes adversus astrologiam divinicatrium ( treatise against predictive astrology ) , which was not published until after his death in it , pico acidly condemned the deterministic practices of the astrologers of his day ben-zaken , avner , '' defying authority , rejecting predestination and conquering nature '' , in reading hayy ibn-yaqzan : a cross-cultural history of autodidacticism ( johns hopkins university press , 2011 ) , 65–101 he was interred together with girolamo benivieni at san marco , and savonarola delivered the funeral oration ficino wrote : in 2007 , the bodies of poliziano and pico were exhumed from the san_marco , _florence in florence to establish the causes of their deaths in the oratio de hominis dignitate ( oration on the dignity of man , 1486 ) , pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a neoplatonic framework the oration also served as an introduction to pico 's 900 theses , which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge , and hence a model for mankind 's ascent of the chain of being the beardless young man in raphael 's fresco the school of athens ( 1509–11 ) is thought to be pico della mirandola ( or maybe francesco della rovere ) busi , the kabbalistic library of giovanni pico della mirandola – 2 the kabbalistic library of giovanni pico della

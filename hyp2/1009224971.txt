susanoo 's name is variously given in the kojiki as 'takehaya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 建速須佐之男命 ) , 'haya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 速須佐之男命 ) , or simply as 'susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 須佐之男命 ) the fudoki of izumo province renders his name both as 'kamu-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 神須佐能袁命 ) and 'susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 須佐能乎命 ) 712 ce ) and the nihon shoki ( 720 ce ) both agree in their description of susanoo as the son of the god izanagi and the younger brother of amaterasu , the goddess of the sun , and of tsukuyomi , the god of the moon the circumstances surrounding the birth of these three deities , collectively known as the '' three precious children '' ( 三貴子 – mihashira-no-uzunomiko , sankishi ) , however , vary between sources in the kojiki , amaterasu , tsukuyomi , and susanoo came into existence when izanagi misogi in a river to purify himself after visiting yomi , the underworld , in a failed attempt to rescue his deceased wife , izanami amaterasu was born when izanagi washed his left eye , tsukuyomi was born when he washed his right eye , and susanoo was born when he washed his nose izanagi then appoints amaterasu to rule takamagahara ( 高天原 , the '' plain of high heaven '' ) , tsukuyomi the night , and susanoo the seas the main narrative of the nihon shoki has izanagi and izanami procreating after kuniumi ; to them were born ( in the following order ) amaterasu , tsukuyomi , the 'leech-child ' hiruko , and susanoo amaterasu and tsukuyomi were sent up to heaven to govern it , while hiruko – who even at the age of three could not stand upright – was placed on the 'rock-camphor boat of heaven ' ( 天磐櫲樟船 , ame-no-iwakusufune ) and set adrift susanoo , whose wailing laid waste to the land , was expelled and sent to the netherworld ( ne-no-kuni ) ) a variant legend recorded in the shoki has izanagi begetting amaterasu by holding a bronze mirror in his left hand , tsukuyomi by holding another mirror in his right hand , and susanoo by turning his head and looking sideways susanoo is here also said to be banished by izanagi due to his destructive nature a third variant in the shoki has izanagi and izanami begetting amaterasu , tsukuyomi , hiruko , and susanoo , as in the main narrative amaterasu , suspicious of his motives , went out to meet him dressed in male clothing and clad in armor , but when susanoo proposed a trial by pledge ( ukehi ) to prove his sincerity , she accepted both the kojiki and the shoki 's main account relate that amaterasu broke susanoo 's ten-span sword ( 十拳剣 / 十握剣 , totsuka-no-tsurugi ) into three , chewed them and then spat them out susanoo then took the strings of magatama beads amaterasu entwined in her hair and round her wrists , likewise chewed the beads and spat them out another variant account in the shoki has susanoo meet a kami named ha'akarutama ( 羽明玉 ) on his way to heaven in this version , amaterasu begets the three goddesses after chewing the magatama beads susanoo obtained earlier , while susanoo begets the five gods after biting off the edge of amaterasu 's sword . susanoo , mutō tenjin and gozu tennō originally a deity of foreign import ( india and korea have all been suggested as possible origins ) , gozu tennō was widely revered since the heian period as a god of pestilence , who both caused disease and cured them gozu tennō became associated with another deity called mutō-no-kami ( 武塔神 ) or mutō tenjin ( 武塔天神 ) , who appears in the legend of somin shorai ( 蘇民将来 ) this suggests that susanoo and mutō tenjin were already conflated in the nara period , if not earlier rahu and ketu from hindu mythology ) ; ōbayashi thus also interprets susanoo as a bad hero while the izumo fudoki claims that the township of susa in izumo is named after its deity susanoo , it has been proposed that the opposite might have actually been the case and susanoo was named after the place , with his name being understood in this case as meaning '' man ( o ) of susa susanoo is thus supposed in this view to have originally been a foreign god ( 蕃神 banshin ) , perhaps a deified shaman , whose origins may be traced back to korea one of the offensive acts susanoo committed during his rampage was 'skinning backward ' ( 逆剥 , sakahagi ) the ame-no-fuchikoma ( japanese : 天の斑駒 , '' heavenly-piebald horse '' ) in addition to his connections with the sea and tempests , due to his mythical role as the slayer of the yamata no orochi and his historical association with pestilence deities such as gozu tennō , susanoo is also venerated as a god who wards off misfortune and calamity , being invoked especially against illness and disease susanoo is worshiped in a number of shrines throughout japan , especially in shimane prefecture ( the eastern part of which is the historical izumo province ) : ja : 八重垣神社 ( 八重垣神社 ) , in matsue , shimane prefecture : dedicated to susanoo , kushinadahime , ōnamuchi ( ōkuninushi ) and aohata-sakusahiko , the shrine takes its name from the 'eightfold fence ' ( yaegaki ) mentioned in susanoo 's song hikawa shrine ( 氷川神社 ) in ōmiya , saitama , saitama prefecture hikawa shrine in kawagoe , saitama prefecture hikawa shrine in akasaka , minato , tokyo

susanoo 's name is variously given in the kojiki as 'takehaya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 建速須佐之男命 ) , 'haya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 速須佐之男命 ) , or simply as 'susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 須佐之男命 ) he is meanwhile named in the nihon shoki as 'susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 素戔嗚尊 ) , 'kamu-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 神素戔嗚尊 ) , 'haya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 速素戔嗚尊 ) , and 'take-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 武素戔嗚尊 ) 712 ce ) and the nihon shoki ( 720 ce ) both agree in their description of susanoo as the son of the god izanagi and the younger brother of amaterasu , the goddess of the sun , and of tsukuyomi , the god of the moon the circumstances surrounding the birth of these three deities , collectively known as the '' three precious children '' ( 三貴子 – mihashira-no-uzunomiko , sankishi ) , however , vary between sources in the kojiki , amaterasu , tsukuyomi , and susanoo came into existence when izanagi misogi in a river to purify himself after visiting yomi , the underworld , in a failed attempt to rescue his deceased wife , izanami amaterasu was born when izanagi washed his left eye , tsukuyomi was born when he washed his right eye , and susanoo was born when he washed his nose izanagi then appoints amaterasu to rule takamagahara ( 高天原 , the '' plain of high heaven '' ) , tsukuyomi the night , and susanoo the seas the main narrative of the nihon shoki has izanagi and izanami procreating after kuniumi ; to them were born ( in the following order ) amaterasu , tsukuyomi , the 'leech-child ' hiruko , and susanoo ( in the kojiki , hiruko is the couple 's very first offspring , born before the islands of japan and the other deities were created ; there he is set afloat on a reed boat ) a variant legend recorded in the shoki has izanagi begetting amaterasu by holding a bronze mirror in his left hand , tsukuyomi by holding another mirror in his right hand , and susanoo by turning his head and looking sideways a third variant in the shoki has izanagi and izanami begetting amaterasu , tsukuyomi , hiruko , and susanoo , as in the main narrative amaterasu , suspicious of his motives , went out to meet him dressed in male clothing and clad in armor , but when susanoo proposed a trial by pledge ( ukehi ) to prove his sincerity , she accepted another variant account in the shoki has susanoo meet a kami named ha'akarutama ( 羽明玉 ) on his way to heaven a third variant has amaterasu chewing three different swords to beget the three goddesses as in the first variant section xiv.—the august declaration of the division of the august male children and the august female children the syncretic deity gozu tennō ( 牛頭天王 , '' ox-headed heavenly king '' ) , originally worshiped at yasaka shrine in kyoto and at other shrines such as tsushima shrine in aichi prefecture , was historically conflated with susanoo originally a deity of foreign import ( india and korea have all been suggested as possible origins ) , gozu tennō was widely revered since the heian period as a god of pestilence , who both caused disease and cured them gozu tennō became associated with another deity called mutō-no-kami ( 武塔神 ) or mutō tenjin ( 武塔天神 ) , who appears in the legend of somin shorai ( 蘇民将来 ) the image of susanoo that can be gleaned from various texts is rather complex and contradictory rahu and ketu from hindu mythology ) ; ōbayashi thus also interprets susanoo as a bad hero mythologist : ja : 松村武雄 for instance believed the izumo fudoki to more accurately reflect susanoo 's original character : a peaceful , simple kami of the rice fields : ja : 松本信廣 , in a similar vein , interpreted susanoo as a harvest deity while the izumo fudoki claims that the township of susa in izumo is named after its deity susanoo , it has been proposed that the opposite might have actually been the case and susanoo was named after the place , with his name being understood in this case as meaning '' man ( o ) of susa unlike other scholars who connect susanoo with izumo , matsumae instead saw kii province ( the modern prefectures of wakayama and mie ) as the birthplace of susanoo worship , pointing out that there was also a settlement in kii named susa ( 須佐 ) ) matsumae proposed that the worship of susanoo was brought to other places in japan by seafaring peoples from kii , a land rich in timber ( the province 's name is itself derived from the word ki meaning 'tree ' ) emilia gadeleva ( 2000 ) sees susanoo 's original character as being that of a rain god – more precisely , a god associated with rainmaking – with his association with the harvest and a number of other elements from his myths ultimately springing from his connection with rainwater ( in the kojiki and in variant accounts contained in the shoki , ōnamuchi / ōnamuji ( ōkuninushi ) is instead susanoo 's descendant : ja : 須我神社 ( 須我神社 ) in unnan , shimane prefecture : this shrine , claimed to stand on the site of the palace susanoo built after defeating the yamata no orochi , enshrines susanoo , kushinadahime , and their son suga-no-yuyamanushi-minasarohiko-yashima-no-mikoto ( 清之湯山主三名狭漏彦八島野命 , i.e : ja : 八重垣神社 ( 八重垣神社 ) , in matsue , shimane prefecture : dedicated to susanoo , kushinadahime , ōnamuchi ( ōkuninushi ) and aohata-sakusahiko , the shrine takes its name from the 'eightfold fence ' ( yaegaki ) mentioned in susanoo 's song its deity , known under the name 'izanagi-no-himanago kaburogi kumano-no-ōkami kushimikenu-no-mikoto ' ( 伊邪那伎日真名子加夫呂伎熊野大神櫛御気野命 , '' beloved child of izanagi , divine ancestor and great deity of kumano , kushimikenu-no-mikoto ' ) , is identified with susanoo

susanoo 's name is variously given in the kojiki as 'takehaya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 建速須佐之男命 ) , 'haya-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 速須佐之男命 ) , or simply as 'susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 須佐之男命 ) the fudoki of izumo province renders his name both as 'kamu-susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 神須佐能袁命 ) and 'susanoo-no-mikoto ' ( 須佐能乎命 ) 712 ce ) and the nihon shoki ( 720 ce ) both agree in their description of susanoo as the son of the god izanagi and the younger brother of amaterasu , the goddess of the sun , and of tsukuyomi , the god of the moon the circumstances surrounding the birth of these three deities , collectively known as the '' three precious children '' ( 三貴子 – mihashira-no-uzunomiko , sankishi ) , however , vary between sources in the kojiki , amaterasu , tsukuyomi , and susanoo came into existence when izanagi misogi in a river to purify himself after visiting yomi , the underworld , in a failed attempt to rescue his deceased wife , izanami amaterasu was born when izanagi washed his left eye , tsukuyomi was born when he washed his right eye , and susanoo was born when he washed his nose izanagi then appoints amaterasu to rule takamagahara ( 高天原 , the '' plain of high heaven '' ) , tsukuyomi the night , and susanoo the seas the main narrative of the nihon shoki has izanagi and izanami procreating after kuniumi ; to them were born ( in the following order ) amaterasu , tsukuyomi , the 'leech-child ' hiruko , and susanoo ( in the kojiki , hiruko is the couple 's very first offspring , born before the islands of japan and the other deities were created ; there he is set afloat on a reed boat ) a variant legend recorded in the shoki has izanagi begetting amaterasu by holding a bronze mirror in his left hand , tsukuyomi by holding another mirror in his right hand , and susanoo by turning his head and looking sideways susanoo is here also said to be banished by izanagi due to his destructive nature a third variant in the shoki has izanagi and izanami begetting amaterasu , tsukuyomi , hiruko , and susanoo , as in the main narrative amaterasu , suspicious of his motives , went out to meet him dressed in male clothing and clad in armor , but when susanoo proposed a trial by pledge ( ukehi ) to prove his sincerity , she accepted five male deities – ame-no-oshihomimi , ame-no-hohi , amatsuhikone , ikutsuhikone , and kumano-no-kusubi – then came into existence a variant account in the shoki has amaterasu chew three different swords she bore with her – a ten-span sword , a nine-span sword ( 九握剣 , kokonotsuka no tsurugi ) , and an eight-span sword ( 八握剣 , yatsuka no tsurugi ) – while susanoo chewed the magatama necklace that hung on his neck another variant account in the shoki has susanoo meet a kami named ha'akarutama ( 羽明玉 ) on his way to heaven in this version , amaterasu begets the three goddesses after chewing the magatama beads susanoo obtained earlier , while susanoo begets the five gods after biting off the edge of amaterasu 's sword section xiv.—the august declaration of the division of the august male children and the august female children the syncretic deity gozu tennō ( 牛頭天王 , '' ox-headed heavenly king '' ) , originally worshiped at yasaka shrine in kyoto and at other shrines such as tsushima shrine in aichi prefecture , was historically conflated with susanoo he then went to the home of a poor man ( sometimes identified as the rich man 's brother ) named somin shōrai , who gave him food and shelter the deity in this story , mutō , is often conflated with gozu tennō ( who , as his name implies , was born with the head of an ox ) in later retellings , though one version identifies gozu tennō as mutō tenjin 's son the earliest known version of this legend , found in the fudoki of bingo province ( modern eastern hiroshima prefecture ) compiled during the nara period ( preserved in an extract quoted by scholar and shinto priest urabe kanekata in the shaku nihongi ) , has mutō explicitly identify himself as susanoo rahu and ketu from hindu mythology ) ; ōbayashi thus also interprets susanoo as a bad hero while both matsumura and matsumoto preferred to connect susanoo with rice fields and the harvest , : ja : 松前健 put forward the theory that susanoo was originally worshiped as a patron deity of sailors unlike other scholars who connect susanoo with izumo , matsumae instead saw kii province ( the modern prefectures of wakayama and mie ) as the birthplace of susanoo worship , pointing out that there was also a settlement in kii named susa ( 須佐 ) ) matsumae proposed that the worship of susanoo was brought to other places in japan by seafaring peoples from kii , a land rich in timber ( the province 's name is itself derived from the word ki meaning 'tree ' ) susanoo is thus supposed in this view to have originally been a foreign god ( 蕃神 banshin ) , perhaps a deified shaman , whose origins may be traced back to korea ) tsuda sōkichi saw a political significance in this story : he interpreted amaterasu as an emperor-symbol , while susanoo in his view symbolized the various rebels who ( unsuccessfully ) rose up against the yamato court : ja : 熊野大社 ( 熊野大社 ) in matsue , shimane prefecture : reckoned as izumo province 's ichinomiya alongside izumo taisha its deity , known under the name 'izanagi-no-himanago kaburogi kumano-no-ōkami kushimikenu-no-mikoto ' ( 伊邪那伎日真名子加夫呂伎熊野大神櫛御気野命 , '' beloved child of izanagi , divine ancestor and great deity of kumano , kushimikenu-no-mikoto ' ) , is identified with susanoo

the inner london education authority was established when the greater london council ( glc ) replaced the london county council as the principal local authority for london in 1965 the lcc had taken over responsibility for education in inner london from the london school board in 1904 it advocated a london-wide division of educational powers between the glc and the london boroughs councils in the future outer london area wanted greater control over education , preventing the creation of a london-wide lea , and there was strong opposition from teachers and other bodies to the idea of dividing up the lcc lea the london government act 1963 therefore created the ilea to inherit the educational responsibilities of the lcc , and gave outer london boroughs lea status the ilea was originally conceived as a provisional body whose status would be reviewed before 1970 , but the labour government made its status permanent in 1965 the ilea did not cover the small area of north woolwich , which was part of the county of london but was transferred to the new london borough of newham in outer london technically the glc itself was the education authority for inner london , but it was both administratively difficult and politically unjust to allow outer london members of the glc to have an input therefore , the glc delegated responsibility to the ilea as a 'special committee ' , consisting of the members of the glc from the inner london area , plus one member delegated from each of the inner london boroughs and the city of london when ilea was abolished in 1990 ownership of the theatre transferred to the london borough of westminster the abolition of the glc , announced in 1983 , led to another attempt to get rid of the ilea , but the inner london boroughs were adjudged not ready to handle education services the inner london boroughs then became education authorities , and remain so today

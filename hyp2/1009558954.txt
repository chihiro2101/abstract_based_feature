for example , english is related to other indo-european languages and mandarin chinese is related to other sino-tibetan languages by this criterion , each language isolate constitutes a family of its own , which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists this frequently happens with sign languagesâ€”most famously in the case of nicaraguan sign language , where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language with unsigned languages , this is not very likely to occur at any one time but , over the tens of thousands of years of human prehistory , the likelihood of this occurring at least a few times increases there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages however , many extinct languages are very poorly attested , and the fact that they can not be linked to other languages may be a reflection of our poor knowledge of them a language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered , but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing a number of sign languages have arisen independently , without any ancestral language , and thus are true language isolates below is a list of known language isolates , arranged by continent , along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families however , the genetic unity of some language families , like nilo-saharan , is questionable , and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted ethnologue 's list of language isolates

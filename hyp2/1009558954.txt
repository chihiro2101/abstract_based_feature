the term '' genetic relationship '' is meant in the genealogical sense of historical linguistics , which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of families , according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages by this criterion , each language isolate constitutes a family of its own , which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists this frequently happens with sign languagesâ€”most famously in the case of nicaraguan sign language , where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language similarly , if deaf parents were to raise a group of hearing children who have no contact with others until adulthood , those children might develop an oral idioglossia and keep using it later , teaching it to their children , and so on with unsigned languages , this is not very likely to occur at any one time but , over the tens of thousands of years of human prehistory , the likelihood of this occurring at least a few times increases there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages a language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered , but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing a number of sign languages have arisen independently , without any ancestral language , and thus are true language isolates these and more are all presumed isolates or small local families , because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language , and have manifestly , as shown by the language itself , not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages below is a list of known language isolates , arranged by continent , along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families native languages and language families of north america ( rev

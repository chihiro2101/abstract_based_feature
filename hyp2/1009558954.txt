a '' genetic relationship '' is a connection between languages , like similarities in vocabulary or grammar , that can be attributed to a common ancestral proto-language that diverged into multiple languages or branches for example , english is related to other indo-european languages and mandarin chinese is related to other sino-tibetan languages by this criterion , each language isolate constitutes a family of its own , which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists this frequently happens with sign languagesâ€”most famously in the case of nicaraguan sign language , where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language eventually , it could develop into the full-fledged language of a population there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages a language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered , but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing in tanzania , for example , there are seven schools for the deaf , each with its own sign language with no known connection to any other language these and more are all presumed isolates or small local families , because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language , and have manifestly , as shown by the language itself , not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages below is a list of known language isolates , arranged by continent , along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families however , the genetic unity of some language families , like nilo-saharan , is questionable , and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted

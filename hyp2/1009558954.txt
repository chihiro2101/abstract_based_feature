the term '' genetic relationship '' is meant in the genealogical sense of historical linguistics , which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of families , according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages a '' genetic relationship '' is a connection between languages , like similarities in vocabulary or grammar , that can be attributed to a common ancestral proto-language that diverged into multiple languages or branches by this criterion , each language isolate constitutes a family of its own , which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists this frequently happens with sign languagesâ€”most famously in the case of nicaraguan sign language , where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages hattic , gutian , and kassite are also believed by mainstream majority to be isolates , but their status is disputed by a minority of linguists many extinct languages of the americas such as cayuse and majena may likewise have been isolates a number of sign languages have arisen independently , without any ancestral language , and thus are true language isolates in tanzania , for example , there are seven schools for the deaf , each with its own sign language with no known connection to any other language '' extinct '' languages have no native speakers , but are sufficiently documented to be classified as isolates however , the genetic unity of some language families , like nilo-saharan , is questionable , and so there may be many more language families and isolates than currently accepted

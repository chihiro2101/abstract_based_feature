the term '' genetic relationship '' is meant in the genealogical sense of historical linguistics , which groups most languages spoken in the world today into a relatively small number of families , according to reconstructed descent from common ancestral languages by this criterion , each language isolate constitutes a family of its own , which explains the exceptional interest that these languages have received from linguists this frequently happens with sign languagesâ€”most famously in the case of nicaraguan sign language , where deaf children with no language were placed together and developed a new language there are also creole languages and constructed languages such as esperanto , which do not descend directly from a single ancestor but have become the language of a population ; however , they do take elements from existing languages many extinct languages of the americas such as cayuse and majena may likewise have been isolates a language thought to be an isolate may turn out to be relatable to other languages once enough material is recovered , but material is unlikely to be recovered if a language was not documented in writing a number of sign languages have arisen independently , without any ancestral language , and thus are true language isolates these and more are all presumed isolates or small local families , because many deaf communities are made up of people whose hearing parents do not use sign language , and have manifestly , as shown by the language itself , not borrowed their sign language from other deaf communities during the recorded history of these languages below is a list of known language isolates , arranged by continent , along with notes on possible relations to other languages or language families defaka and ega are highly divergent languages located within niger-congo-speaking areas , and may also possibly be language isolates native languages and language families of north america ( rev

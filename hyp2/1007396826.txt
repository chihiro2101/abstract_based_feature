during breeding , adults sometimes give a caw or sighing or hissing calls nestlings communicate with squealing or squawking calls darters are mostly tropical in distribution , ranging into subtropical and barely into warm temperate regions most are sedentary and do not migrate ; the populations in the coolest parts of the range may migrate however their preferred mode of flight is soaring and gliding ; in flapping flight they are rather cumbersome on dry land , darters walk with a high-stepped gait , wings often spread for balance , just like pelicans do darters feed mainly on mid-sized fish ; e.g they do not dive deep but make use of their low buoyancy made possible by wettable plumage , small air sacs and denser bones to dry their feathers after diving , darters move to a safe location and spread their wings but many would-be predators know better than to try to catch a darter the long neck and pointed bill in combination with the '' darting '' mechanism make the birds dangerous even to larger carnivorous mammals , and they will actually move toward an intruder to attack rather than defending passively or fleeing the darters pair bond monogamously at least for a breeding season to strengthen the pair bond , partners rub their bills or wave , point upwards or bow their necks in unison when one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest , males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship ; during changeovers , the birds may also '' yawn '' at each other breeding is seasonal ( peaking in march/april ) at the northern end of their range ; elsewhere they can be found breeding all year round the nests are made of twigs and lined with leaves ; they are built in trees or reeds , usually near water the clutch size is two to six eggs ( usually about four ) which have a pale green color the eggs are laid within 24–48 hours and incubated for 25 to 30 days , starting after the first has been laid ; they hatch asynchronously the last young to hatch will usually starve in years with little food available answers.com 2009 , myers et al 2009 these birds reach sexual maturity by about two years , and generally live to around nine years anage 2009 , myers et al 2009 darter eggs are edible and considered delicious by some ; they are locally collected by humans as food darter eggs and nestlings are also collected in a few places to raise the young on the other hand , as evidenced by the etymology of '' anhinga '' detailed above , the tupi seem to have considered the anhinga a kind of bird of ill omen the genus anhinga was introduced by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 with the anhinga or american darter ( anhinga anhinga ) as the type species anhinga is derived from the tupi ajíŋa ( also transcribed áyinga or ayingá ) , which in local mythology refers to a malevolent demonic forest spirit ; it is often translated as '' devil bird '' however , in its first documented use as an english term in 1818 , it referred to an old world darter ever since , it has also been used for the modern genus anhinga as a whole in fact , several darter fossils were initially believed to be cormorants or shags ( see below ) 2009 the sulae are also united by their characteristic display behavior , which agrees with the phylogeny as laid out by anatomical and dna sequence data grandis , but distinctness in space and time makes assignment to that species questionable : mackness ( 1995 ) , alvarenga & guilherme ( 2003 ) anhinga sp melanogaster and apparently quite distinct : becker ( 1986 ) , mackness ( 1995 ) anhinga sp

anhingidae are large birds with sexual dimorphism plumage the males have black and dark-brown plumage , a short erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female the females have much paler plumage , especially on the neck and underparts , and are a bit larger overall the darters have completely webbed feet , and their legs are short and set far back on the body brodkorb & mourer-chauviré ( 1982 ) , myers et al 2009 there is no eclipse plumage , but the bare parts vary in color around the year the young hatch naked , but soon grow white or tan down during breeding , adults sometimes give a caw or sighing or hissing calls their preferred mode of flight is soaring and gliding ; in flapping flight they are rather cumbersome on dry land , darters walk with a high-stepped gait , wings often spread for balance , just like pelicans do melanogaster sensu stricto ) is a near threatened species darters feed mainly on mid-sized fish ; e.g these birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey ; then they use their sharply pointed beak to impale the food animal they do not dive deep but make use of their low buoyancy made possible by wettable plumage , small air sacs and denser bones like cormorants , they have a vestigial preen gland and their plumage gets wet during diving to dry their feathers after diving , darters move to a safe location and spread their wings the darters pair bond monogamously at least for a breeding season when one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest , males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship ; during changeovers , the birds may also '' yawn '' at each other they are fed by regurgitation of partly digested food when young , switching to entire food items as they grow older 2009 these birds reach sexual maturity by about two years , and generally live to around nine years anage 2009 , myers et al the genus anhinga was introduced by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 with the anhinga or american darter ( anhinga anhinga ) as the type species however , in its first documented use as an english term in 1818 , it referred to an old world darter ever since , it has also been used for the modern genus anhinga as a whole 2009 the sulae are also united by their characteristic display behavior , which agrees with the phylogeny as laid out by anatomical and dna sequence data like cormorants but unlike other birds , darters use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display the supposed traits uniting them , like all-webbed toes and a bare gular sac , are now known to be convergent , and pelicans are apparently closer relatives of storks than of the sulae hence , the sulae and the frigatebirds – and some prehistoric relatives – are increasingly separated as the suliformes , which is sometimes dubbed '' phalacrocoraciformes '' christidis & boles ( 2008 ) : p.100 , anwers.com 2009 , mayr ( 2009 ) : pp.67–70 , myers et al there are four living species of darters recognized , all in the genus anhinga , although the old world ones were often lumped together as subspecies of a anhinga : noriega ( 1994 ) , cione et al anhinga : becker ( 1986 ) anhinga hadarensis brodkorb & mourer-chauviré , 1982 ( late pliocene/early pleistocene of e africa ) the holotype is a well-preserved left femur ( al 288-52 ) merriam-webster ( mw ) 2009 : online english dictionary – anhinga

anhingidae are large birds with sexual dimorphism plumage the males have black and dark-brown plumage , a short erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female the darters have completely webbed feet , and their legs are short and set far back on the body brodkorb & mourer-chauviré ( 1982 ) , myers et al 2009 there is no eclipse plumage , but the bare parts vary in color around the year during breeding , however , their small gular sac changes from pink or yellow to black , and the bare facial skin , otherwise yellow or yellow-green , turns turquoise on dry land , darters walk with a high-stepped gait , wings often spread for balance , just like pelicans do crustacea ( crabs , crayfish and shrimps ) , insects , leeches and mollusks : myers et al these birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey ; then they use their sharply pointed beak to impale the food animal after they have stabbed the prey , they return to the surface where they toss their food into the air and catch it again , so that they can swallow it head-first to strengthen the pair bond , partners rub their bills or wave , point upwards or bow their necks in unison the clutch size is two to six eggs ( usually about four ) which have a pale green color the eggs are laid within 24–48 hours and incubated for 25 to 30 days , starting after the first has been laid ; they hatch asynchronously to provide warmth to the eggs , the parents will cover them with their large webbed feet , because like their relatives they lack a brood patch the last young to hatch will usually starve in years with little food available they are fed by regurgitation of partly digested food when young , switching to entire food items as they grow older the maximum possible lifespan of darters seems to be about sixteen years anage 2009 , myers et al darter eggs and nestlings are also collected in a few places to raise the young with an increasing number of nomads settling down in recent decades , this cultural heritage is in danger of being lost the genus anhinga was introduced by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 with the anhinga or american darter ( anhinga anhinga ) as the type species however , in its first documented use as an english term in 1818 , it referred to an old world darter jobling ( 1991 ) : p.48 , mw 2009 this family is very closely related to the other families in the suborder sulae , i.e genera like borvocarbo , limicorallus or piscator : mayr ( 2009 ) : pp.65–67 some unite the anhingidae and phalacrocoracidae in a superfamily phalacrocoracoidea while the darters ' lack of many display behaviors is shared with gannets ( and that of a few with cormorants ) , these are all symplesiomorphies that are absent in frigatebirds , tropicbirds and pelicans also like cormorants but unlike other birds , darters use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display that they often balance with their outstretched wings during walking is probably an autapomorphy of darters , necessitated by their being plumper than the other sulae there are four living species of darters recognized , all in the genus anhinga , although the old world ones were often lumped together as subspecies of a but these are actually misidentified bones of the long-tailed cormorant ( microcarbo/phalacrocorax africanus ) and the little pied cormorant ( m./p their distinctness has been doubted , but this was due to the supposed '' anhinga '' fraileyi being rather similar to macranhinga , rather than due to them resembling the living species : cione et al anhinga : noriega ( 1994 ) , cione et al anhinga : becker ( 1986 ) anhinga hadarensis brodkorb & mourer-chauviré , 1982 ( late pliocene/early pleistocene of e africa ) the holotype is a well-preserved left femur ( al 288-52 ) merriam-webster ( mw ) 2009 : online english dictionary – anhinga

anhingidae are large birds with sexual dimorphism plumage the males have black and dark-brown plumage , a short erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female the females have much paler plumage , especially on the neck and underparts , and are a bit larger overall brodkorb & mourer-chauviré ( 1982 ) , myers et al the iris changes in color between yellow , red or brown seasonally darters are mostly tropical in distribution , ranging into subtropical and barely into warm temperate regions on dry land , darters walk with a high-stepped gait , wings often spread for balance , just like pelicans do melanogaster sensu stricto ) is a near threatened species crustacea ( crabs , crayfish and shrimps ) , insects , leeches and mollusks : myers et al these birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey ; then they use their sharply pointed beak to impale the food animal like cormorants , they have a vestigial preen gland and their plumage gets wet during diving darters go through a synchronous moult of all their primaries and secondaries making them temporarily flightless , although it is possible that some individuals go through incomplete moults males display to attract females by raising ( but not stretching ) their wings to wave them in an alternating fashion , bowing and snapping the bill , or giving twigs to potential mates breeding is seasonal ( peaking in march/april ) at the northern end of their range ; elsewhere they can be found breeding all year round nest construction takes only a few days ( about three at most ) , and the pairs copulate at the nest site the clutch size is two to six eggs ( usually about four ) which have a pale green color to provide warmth to the eggs , the parents will cover them with their large webbed feet , because like their relatives they lack a brood patch answers.com 2009 , myers et al 2009 darter eggs are edible and considered delicious by some ; they are locally collected by humans as food darter eggs and nestlings are also collected in a few places to raise the young on the other hand , as evidenced by the etymology of '' anhinga '' detailed above , the tupi seem to have considered the anhinga a kind of bird of ill omen the genus anhinga was introduced by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 with the anhinga or american darter ( anhinga anhinga ) as the type species ever since , it has also been used for the modern genus anhinga as a whole jobling ( 1991 ) : p.48 , mw 2009 this family is very closely related to the other families in the suborder sulae , i.e some earlier authors included the darters in the phalacrocoracidae as subfamily anhingina ' , but this is nowadays generally considered overlumping like cormorants but unlike other birds , darters use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display that they often balance with their outstretched wings during walking is probably an autapomorphy of darters , necessitated by their being plumper than the other sulae but these are actually misidentified bones of the long-tailed cormorant ( microcarbo/phalacrocorax africanus ) and the little pied cormorant ( m./p miller ( 1966 ) , olson ( 1975 ) , brodkorb & mourer-chauviré ( 1982 ) , olson ( 1985 ) : p.206 , mackness ( 1995 ) the fossil record of the anhingidae is rather dense , but very apomorphic already and appears to be lacking its base 40 ma ) and fossil cormorants appearing soon thereafter , the origin of the darters as a distinct lineage was presumably around 50–40 ma , maybe a bit earlier anhinga : becker ( 1986 ) anhinga hadarensis brodkorb & mourer-chauviré , 1982 ( late pliocene/early pleistocene of e africa ) the holotype is a well-preserved left femur ( al 288-52 ) merriam-webster ( mw ) 2009 : online english dictionary – anhinga

anhingidae are large birds with sexual dimorphism plumage the males have black and dark-brown plumage , a short erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female the females have much paler plumage , especially on the neck and underparts , and are a bit larger overall both have grey stippling on long scapulars and upper wing coverts the sharply pointed beak has serrated edges , a desmognathous palate and no external nostrils brodkorb & mourer-chauviré ( 1982 ) , myers et al 2009 darter vocalizations include a clicking or rattling when flying or perching darters are mostly tropical in distribution , ranging into subtropical and barely into warm temperate regions most are sedentary and do not migrate ; the populations in the coolest parts of the range may migrate however their preferred mode of flight is soaring and gliding ; in flapping flight they are rather cumbersome on dry land , darters walk with a high-stepped gait , wings often spread for balance , just like pelicans do anura ( frogs and toads ) , caudata ( newts and salamanders ) , snakes , turtles and even baby crocodilians : myers et al crustacea ( crabs , crayfish and shrimps ) , insects , leeches and mollusks : myers et al but many would-be predators know better than to try to catch a darter breeding is seasonal ( peaking in march/april ) at the northern end of their range ; elsewhere they can be found breeding all year round the nests are made of twigs and lined with leaves ; they are built in trees or reeds , usually near water typically , the male gathers nesting material and brings it to the female , which does most of the actual construction work nest construction takes only a few days ( about three at most ) , and the pairs copulate at the nest site the clutch size is two to six eggs ( usually about four ) which have a pale green color the eggs are laid within 24–48 hours and incubated for 25 to 30 days , starting after the first has been laid ; they hatch asynchronously answers.com 2009 , myers et al 2009 these birds reach sexual maturity by about two years , and generally live to around nine years 2009 darter eggs are edible and considered delicious by some ; they are locally collected by humans as food the genus anhinga was introduced by the french zoologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 with the anhinga or american darter ( anhinga anhinga ) as the type species ever since , it has also been used for the modern genus anhinga as a whole cormorants and darters are extremely similar as regards their body and leg skeletons and may be sister taxa however , as this agrees quite well with the fossil evidence e.g like cormorants but unlike other birds , darters use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display the fossil record of the anhingidae is rather dense , but very apomorphic already and appears to be lacking its base 40 ma ) and fossil cormorants appearing soon thereafter , the origin of the darters as a distinct lineage was presumably around 50–40 ma , maybe a bit earlier anhinga and more plesiomorphic : brodkorb ( 1956 ) , becker ( 1986 ) anhinga cf melanogaster and apparently quite distinct : becker ( 1986 ) , mackness ( 1995 ) anhinga sp merriam-webster ( mw ) 2009 : online english dictionary – anhinga

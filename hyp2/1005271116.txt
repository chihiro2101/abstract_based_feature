environment and climate change canada defines brownfields as '' abandoned , idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties typically located in urban areas where past actions have caused environmental contamination , but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities the us epa has defined brownfield not simply as a possible improvement site which has been previously improved , but one that may also have impediments , such as '' the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance , pollutant , or contaminant '' the term brownfields first came into use on june 28 , 1992 , at a u.s also in 1992 , the first detailed policy analysis of the issue was convened by the cuyahoga county planning commission the united states environmental protection agency selected cuyahoga county as its first brownfield pilot project in september 1993 bush signed the small business liability relief and brownfields revitalization act ( the “ brownfields law ” ) which provides grants and tools to local governments for the assessment , cleanup , and revitalization of brownfields the motivation for this act was the success of the epa ’ s brownfields program , which it started in the 1990s in response to several court cases that caused lenders to redline contaminated property for fear of liability under the superfund as of september 2015 , the epa estimates that the brownfields program has resulted in 56,442 acres of land readied for reuse in the united kingdom , the term 'brownfield ' has a colloquial meaning roughly equivalent to the american usage described above , i.e in terms of british town and country planning , however , the meaning of 'brownfield ' is more complex , and is often conflated with the technical term 'previously developed land ' ( pdl ) pdl was originally defined in planning policy for housing development in england and wales , and was carefully distinguished in such policy from 'brownfield ' , which was undefined but considered to be different small brownfields also may be found in older residential neighborhoods , as for example dry cleaning establishments or gas stations produced high levels of subsurface contaminants the primary issue facing all nations involved in attracting and sustaining new uses to brownfield sites is globalization of industry canada had about 23,078 federally contaminated sites , from abandoned mines , to airports , lighthouse stations , and military bases , which are classified into n 1,2 , or 3 , depending on a score of contamination , with 5,300 active contaminated sites , 2,300 suspected sites and 15,000 listed as closed because remediated or no action was necessary the provinces´ legal mechanisms for managing risk are limited , as there are no tools such as '' no further action '' letters to give property owners finality and certainty in the cleanup and reuse process '' the federal government exercises some control over environmental protection , the '' provincial and territorial governments issue the bulk of legislation regarding contaminated sites laws in denmark require a higher degree of coordination of planning and reuse than is found in many other countries in france , brownfields are called '' friches industrielles '' and the ministère de l'écologie , du développement durable et de l'énergie ( medde ) maintains a database of polluted sites named basol , with '' more than 4000 sites '' while historic land use patterns created contaminated sites , the superfund law has been criticized as creating the brownfield phenomenon where investment moves to greenfields for new development due to severe , no-fault liability schemes and other disincentives the clinton-gore administration and us epa launched a series of brownfield policies and programs in 1993 to tackle this problem acquisition , adaptive re-use , and disposal of a brownfield site requires advanced and specialized appraisal analysis techniques a 2011 university of delaware study has suggested a 17.5:1 return on dollars invested on brownfield redevelopment to expedite the cleanup of brownfield sites in the us , some environmental firms have teamed up with insurance companies to underwrite the cleanup and provide a guaranteed cleanup cost to limit land developers ' exposure to environmental remediation costs and pollution lawsuits examples of brownfield redevelopment in pittsburgh include : in pittsburgh 's squirrel hill neighborhood , a former slag dump for steel mills was turned into a 243 million residential development called summerset at frick park in the united kingdom , regulation of contaminated land comes from part iia of the environmental protection act 1990 ; responsibility falls on local authorities to create a '' contaminated land register ''

sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) egyptians , nubians and chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings modern day scaffolding standards , practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies : rapid scaffold tie company ltd , tubular scaffolding company and scaffolding great britain ltd ( sgb ) david palmer-jones patented the '' scaffixer '' , a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction the first frame system was brought to market by sgb in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability in general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the european standard sets out performance requirements for working scaffolds the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards the basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding , becoming the baseline for decades , was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s with one basic 24 pound unit a scaffold of various sizes and heights could be assembled easily by a couple of labourers without the nuts or bolts previously needed '' light weight scaffolding goes together without nuts or bolts the tubes come in a variety of lengths and a standard outside diameter of 48.3 & nbsp ; mm the chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes ( 1.7 & nbsp ; kg/m as opposed to 4.4 & nbsp ; kg/m ) they are seasoned wood and come in three thicknesses ( 38 & nbsp ; mm ( usual ) , 50 & nbsp ; mm and 63 & nbsp ; mm ) are a standard width ( 225 & nbsp ; mm ) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long the most common are called scaffold couplers , and there are three basic types : right-angle couplers , putlog couplers and swivel couplers most companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with , in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft despite the metric measurements given , many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units , with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13 & nbsp ; ft down bamboo scaffolding is widely used in hong kong and macau , '' craft of bamboo scaffolding '' praça do tap seac , edif in india , bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used , with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair ( coir ) the base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board as well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity , these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger , next to the standards to which they are fitted to limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level the diagram above also shows a kicker lift , which is just 150 & nbsp ; mm or so above the ground the minimum overhang for all boards is 50 & nbsp ; mm and the maximum overhang is no more than 4x the thickness of the board scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces , although base plates are always recommended general practice is to attach a tie every 4 m on alternate lifts ( traditional scaffolding ) the ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger ( node point ) as possible the gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes when a complete box tie is impossible a l-shaped lip tie can be used to hook the scaffold to the structure , to limit inward movement an additional transom , a butt transom , is placed hard against the outside face of the structure if it is not possible to use a safe number of ties rakers can be used bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries the use of bamboo scaffolding is diminishing due to shortages in labor and material attempts to import bamboo from thailand , or switch to synthetic or plastic bamboo , have so far proved unsuccessful bamboo scaffolding is a temporary structure to support people and materials when constructing or repairing building exteriors and interiors bamboo scaffolding does not need to have a foundation on the ground , as long as the scaffolding has a fulcrum for structural support the bamboo tower used in the famous bun scrambling competition during the cheung chau bun festival on the island of cheung chau is constructed out of bamboo scaffolding spacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold , and ties are still required

sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) egyptians , nubians and chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings early scaffolding was made of wood and secured with rope knots palmer-jones followed this up with the improved '' universal coupler '' in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day the use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability , especially on tall buildings the first frame system was brought to market by sgb in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction in general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the european standard sets out performance requirements for working scaffolds the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards boards provide a working surface for scaffold users they are seasoned wood and come in three thicknesses ( 38 & nbsp ; mm ( usual ) , 50 & nbsp ; mm and 63 & nbsp ; mm ) are a standard width ( 225 & nbsp ; mm ) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long the board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates , which often have the company name stamped into them timber scaffold boards in the uk should comply with the requirements of bs 2482 as well as timber , steel or aluminium decking is used , as well as laminate boards in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used the most common are called scaffold couplers , and there are three basic types : right-angle couplers , putlog couplers and swivel couplers to join tubes end-to-end joint pins ( also called spigots ) or sleeve couplers are used only right angle couplers and swivel couplers can be used to fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection ' other common scaffolding components include base plates , ladders , ropes , anchor ties , reveal ties , gin wheels , sheeting , etc despite the metric measurements given , many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units , with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13 & nbsp ; ft down the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load the base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board transoms rest upon the ledgers at right angles as well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity , these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger , next to the standards to which they are fitted for a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m , for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed the scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards , the minimum width allowed is 600 & nbsp ; mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870 & nbsp ; mm wide from standard to standard the minimum overhang for all boards is 50 & nbsp ; mm and the maximum overhang is no more than 4x the thickness of the board scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces , although base plates are always recommended for softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used , beneath a single standard a sole board should be at least with no dimension less than , the thickness must be at least for heavier duty scaffold much more substantial baulks set in concrete can be required on uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates , a minimum step size of around is recommended general practice is to attach a tie every 4 m on alternate lifts ( traditional scaffolding ) prefabricated system scaffolds require structural connections at all frames - i.e the ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger ( node point ) as possible due to recent regulation changes , scaffolding ties must support +/- loads ( tie/butt loads ) and lateral ( shear ) loads box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features many famous landmarks , notably the great wall of china , were built using bamboo scaffolding , and its use continues today in some parts of the world file : coupler 1.jpg tube and clamp scaffold detail spacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold , and ties are still required din 4421 , a din standard which covers the analysis , design and construction of falsework 29 cfr part 1926 : safety standards for scaffolds used in the construction industry from the u.s

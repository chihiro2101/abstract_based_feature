sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) egyptians , nubians and chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings modern day scaffolding standards , practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies : rapid scaffold tie company ltd , tubular scaffolding company and scaffolding great britain ltd ( sgb ) the european standard , bs en 12811-1 , specifies performance requirements and methods of structural and general design for access and working scaffolds requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the european standard sets out performance requirements for working scaffolds the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards the basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding , becoming the baseline for decades , was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s the tubes come in a variety of lengths and a standard outside diameter of 48.3 & nbsp ; mm the chief difference between the two types of metal tubes is the lower weight of aluminium tubes ( 1.7 & nbsp ; kg/m as opposed to 4.4 & nbsp ; kg/m ) tubes are generally bought in 6.3 m lengths and can then be cut down to certain typical sizes they are seasoned wood and come in three thicknesses ( 38 & nbsp ; mm ( usual ) , 50 & nbsp ; mm and 63 & nbsp ; mm ) are a standard width ( 225 & nbsp ; mm ) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long the board ends are protected either by metal plates called hoop irons or sometimes nail plates , which often have the company name stamped into them in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used the most common are called scaffold couplers , and there are three basic types : right-angle couplers , putlog couplers and swivel couplers other common scaffolding components include base plates , ladders , ropes , anchor ties , reveal ties , gin wheels , sheeting , etc most companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with , in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft despite the metric measurements given , many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units , with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13 & nbsp ; ft down bamboo scaffolding is widely used in hong kong and macau , '' craft of bamboo scaffolding '' pra√ßa do tap seac , edif in india , bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used , with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair ( coir ) the key elements of the scaffolding are the standard , ledger and transoms for a general purpose scaffold the maximum bay length is 2.1 m , for heavier work the bay size is reduced to 2 or even 1.8 m while for inspection a bay width of up to 2.7 m is allowed the scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards , the minimum width allowed is 600 & nbsp ; mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870 & nbsp ; mm wide from standard to standard often scaffold frameworks will require more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load for softer or more doubtful surfaces sole boards must be used , beneath a single standard a sole board should be at least with no dimension less than , the thickness must be at least they must be close-boarded , have double guard rails and toe and stop boards the ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger ( node point ) as possible the gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes these use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening the reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin ( an adjustable threaded bar ) and protective packing at either end a transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold a transom at the base then completes a triangle back to the base of the main scaffold bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries trained worker they should complete formal training in bamboo scaffolding work or hold a trade test certificate on bamboo scaffolding and have at least 3 years of relevant experience file : rietdekken - beilen - 20521600 - rce.jpg the putlog is the horizontal piece on which the platform rests , the upright pole is called a standard file : carpentry and painting lccn2001705885.tif a simple putlog type scaffolding and roof brackets spacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold , and ties are still required index of construction articles national access and scaffolding confederation ( uk trade association ) steeplejack willow island disaster

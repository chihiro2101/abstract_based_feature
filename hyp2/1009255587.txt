sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) egyptians , nubians and chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings scaffolding was erected by individual firms with wildly varying standards and sizes modern day scaffolding standards , practices and processes can be attributed to these men and their companies : rapid scaffold tie company ltd , tubular scaffolding company and scaffolding great britain ltd ( sgb ) david palmer-jones patented the '' scaffixer '' , a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction the first frame system was brought to market by sgb in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction the european standard , bs en 12811-1 , specifies performance requirements and methods of structural and general design for access and working scaffolds requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability in general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the standard is intended to be used as the basis for enquiry and design the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards '' light weight scaffolding goes together without nuts or bolts timber scaffold boards in the uk should comply with the requirements of bs 2482 as well as timber , steel or aluminium decking is used , as well as laminate boards in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used the most common are called scaffold couplers , and there are three basic types : right-angle couplers , putlog couplers and swivel couplers to join tubes end-to-end joint pins ( also called spigots ) or sleeve couplers are used only right angle couplers and swivel couplers can be used to fix tube in a 'load-bearing connection ' bamboo scaffolding is widely used in hong kong and macau , '' craft of bamboo scaffolding '' praça do tap seac , edif in india , bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used , with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair ( coir ) the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load to limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level the scaffolding width is determined by the width of the boards , the minimum width allowed is 600 & nbsp ; mm but a more typical four-board scaffold would be 870 & nbsp ; mm wide from standard to standard often scaffold frameworks will require more than simple base plates to safely carry and spread the load scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces , although base plates are always recommended on uneven ground steps must be cut for the base plates , a minimum step size of around is recommended the ties are coupled to the scaffold as close to the junction of standard and ledger ( node point ) as possible a vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube a transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold if it is not possible to use a safe number of ties rakers can be used these are single tubes attached to a ledger extending out from the scaffold at an angle of less than 75° and securely founded a transom at the base then completes a triangle back to the base of the main scaffold bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries in 2013 , there were 1,751 registered bamboo scaffolders and roughly 200 scaffolding companies in hong kong forms of bamboo scaffolding include : double-row scaffold only double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for working at height access and egress suitable means of access should be provided from the building or ground level to the scaffold such as gangway , stairs and ladder etc bamboo scaffolding is a temporary structure to support people and materials when constructing or repairing building exteriors and interiors a putlog scaffold may also be called a bricklayer 's scaffold spacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold , and ties are still required baker staging is a metal scaffold which is easy to assemble

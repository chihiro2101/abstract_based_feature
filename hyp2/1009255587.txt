sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) egyptians , nubians and chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings early scaffolding was made of wood and secured with rope knots palmer-jones followed this up with the improved '' universal coupler '' in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day the use of diagonal bracings also helped to improve stability , especially on tall buildings the first frame system was brought to market by sgb in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction the european standard , bs en 12811-1 , specifies performance requirements and methods of structural and general design for access and working scaffolds requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability in general these requirements also apply to other types of working scaffolds the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work these are substantially independent of the materials of which the scaffold is made the standard is intended to be used as the basis for enquiry and design the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards most large companies will brand their tubes with their name and address in order to deter theft boards provide a working surface for scaffold users timber scaffold boards in the uk should comply with the requirements of bs 2482 as well as timber , steel or aluminium decking is used , as well as laminate boards in addition to the boards for the working platform , there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect , although ordinary boards can also be used the most common are called scaffold couplers , and there are three basic types : right-angle couplers , putlog couplers and swivel couplers to join tubes end-to-end joint pins ( also called spigots ) or sleeve couplers are used most companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with , in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft the standards , also called uprights , are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load in canada this style is referred to as '' english '' '' american '' has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations as well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity , these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger , next to the standards to which they are fitted the spacings of the basic elements in the scaffold are fairly standard often an inside board is added to reduce the gap between the inner standard and the structure scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces , although base plates are always recommended 2â€“3 m centres ( tie patterns must be provided by the system manufacturer/supplier ) a vertical inside tube crossing the opening is attached to the scaffold by a transom and a crossing horizontal tube on the outside called a bridle tube box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features these use an opening in the structure but use a tube wedged horizontally in the opening a transom at the base then completes a triangle back to the base of the main scaffold bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries it was widely used in the building of houses and multi-story buildings ( up to four stories high ) prior to the development of metal scaffolding it was also useful for short-term construction projects , such as framework for temporary sheds for cantonese opera performances there are three types of scaffolding in hong kong : double-row scaffold ; extended bamboo scaffolding ; shop signs of bamboo scaffolding forms of bamboo scaffolding include : double-row scaffold only double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for working at height for the piu sik parade , bamboo stands and racks are used to hold the young costumed performers above the crowds welded sections stack on top of each other and braced with cross braces , workers stand on planks or aluminum platforms din 4421 , a din standard which covers the analysis , design and construction of falsework 29 cfr part 1926 : safety standards for scaffolds used in the construction industry from the u.s

sockets in the walls around the paleolithic cave paintings at lascaux , suggest that a scaffold system was used for painting the ceiling , over 17,000 years ago the berlin foundry cup depicts scaffolding in ancient greece ( early 5th century bc ) egyptians , nubians and chinese are also recorded as having used scaffolding-like structures to build tall buildings scaffolding was erected by individual firms with wildly varying standards and sizes david palmer-jones patented the '' scaffixer '' , a coupling device far more robust than rope which revolutionized scaffolding construction palmer-jones followed this up with the improved '' universal coupler '' in 1919 - this soon became the industry standard coupling and has remained so to this day the first frame system was brought to market by sgb in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction requirements given are for scaffold structures that rely on the adjacent structures for stability the purpose of a working scaffold is to provide a safe working platform and access suitable for work crews to carry out their work the basic components of scaffolding are tubes , couplers and boards the basic lightweight tube scaffolding that became the standard and revolutionised scaffolding , becoming the baseline for decades , was invented and marketed in the mid-1950s boards provide a working surface for scaffold users to join tubes end-to-end joint pins ( also called spigots ) or sleeve couplers are used other common scaffolding components include base plates , ladders , ropes , anchor ties , reveal ties , gin wheels , sheeting , etc most companies will adopt a specific colour to paint the scaffolding with , in order that quick visual identification can be made in case of theft despite the metric measurements given , many scaffolders measure tubes and boards in imperial units , with tubes from 21 feet down and boards from 13 & nbsp ; ft down bamboo scaffolding is widely used in hong kong and macau , '' craft of bamboo scaffolding '' praça do tap seac , edif in india , bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used , with poles being lashed together using ropes made from coconut hair ( coir ) the base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board ledgers are horizontal tubes which connect between the standards '' american '' has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations to limit sway a facade brace is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base to the top of the scaffold and fixed at every level more heavy-duty scaffolding can require 5 , 6 or even up to 8 boards width the minimum overhang for all boards is 50 & nbsp ; mm and the maximum overhang is no more than 4x the thickness of the board scaffolding can be used without base plates on concrete or similar hard surfaces , although base plates are always recommended for heavier duty scaffold much more substantial baulks set in concrete can be required a working platform requires certain other elements to be safe the gaps between the tubes and the structure surfaces are packed or wedged with timber sections to ensure a solid fit box ties are used to attach the scaffold to suitable pillars or comparable features two additional transoms are put across from the lift on each side of the feature and are joined on both sides with shorter tubes called tie tubes sometimes it is possible to use anchor ties ( also called bolt ties ) , these are ties fitted into holes drilled in the structure the least 'invasive ' tie is a reveal tie the reveal tube is usually held in place by a reveal screw pin ( an adjustable threaded bar ) and protective packing at either end a transom tie tube links the reveal tube to the scaffold bamboo scaffolding is a type of scaffolding made from bamboo and widely used in construction work for centuries bamboo scaffolding was first introduced into the building industry in hong kong immediately after colonization in the 1800s it was also useful for short-term construction projects , such as framework for temporary sheds for cantonese opera performances there are three types of scaffolding in hong kong : double-row scaffold ; extended bamboo scaffolding ; shop signs of bamboo scaffolding forms of bamboo scaffolding include : double-row scaffold only double-row bamboo scaffold is allowed to be used for working at height file : rietdekken - beilen - 20521600 - rce.jpg the putlog is the horizontal piece on which the platform rests , the upright pole is called a standard spacing is the same on a putlog scaffold as on a general purpose scaffold , and ties are still required din 4421 , a din standard which covers the analysis , design and construction of falsework 29 cfr part 1926 : safety standards for scaffolds used in the construction industry from the u.s

the trent and mersey canal ( t & m ) was built to link the river trent at derwent mouth in derbyshire to the river mersey , and thereby provide an inland route between the major ports of hull and liverpool the mersey connection is made via the bridgewater canal , which it joins at preston brook in cheshire the plan of a canal connection from the mersey to the trent ( '' the grand trunk '' ) came from canal engineer james brindley the first known idea to build a canal between the river mersey and the river trent was put forward in 1755 , though no action was taken at that time james brindley , the engineer behind many of the canals in england , did his first canal work on the trent and mersey , though his first job in charge of construction was on the bridgewater canal pots transported by road were liable to be damaged and broken , and a canal near to his factory would provide fast and safe transport for his wares john gilbert 's plan for the '' grand trunk '' canal met opposition at the eastern end where , in burton on trent , the locals objected to the canal passing parallel to the upper trent navigation '' six years before the complete opening of the trent and mersey canal in 1771 , wedgwood built the factory village of etruria on the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , close to the canal up until 1777 , pots had to be carried on the short journey from etruria , over the top of kidsgrove hill , and to the other side , where the canal had been constructed to preston brook on 15 january 1847 the trent and mersey canal was acquired by the north staffordshire railway company ( nsr ) the trent and mersey canal provided the northwestern arm of the cross ( to the mersey ) , and the northeastern arm ( to the trent ) another major feature is the harecastle tunnel , near kidsgrove in the city of stoke-on-trent , north staffordshire the boater can use the macclesfield canal to head for marple , and the junction with the peak forest canal ( and hence , via the ashton , rochdale and bridgewater canal ) to complete the 'cheshire ring ' after the harecastle tunnel ( one way , alternating roughly every two hours ) , the canal emerges in the outskirts of stoke-on-trent , and is soon in the middle of the city and then at etruria , and the junction with the caldon canal it is now in the upper valley of the river trent , which the canal follows until the river becomes navigable and the canal is no longer needed the coventry soon leads to the birmingham and fazeley canal and branches off to birmingham or ( via another stretch of the coventry canal ) to coventry and a junction with the oxford canal and thence to the thames and the 'southern half ' of the english canals

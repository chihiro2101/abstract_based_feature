art of the mentally ill interest in the art of the mentally ill , along with children 's art and the makers of '' folk art '' , was first demonstrated by '' der blaue reiter '' group : wassily kandinsky , auguste macke , franz marc , alexej jawlensky , and others what the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s his most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works , some of which were sold or given as gifts his work is on display at the adolf wölfli foundation in the museum of fine art , bern this was the first formal study of psychiatric works , based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from european institutions the book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time , including paul klee , max ernst , and jean dubuffet '' outsider art sourcebook '' ( raw vision , watford , 2009 , p.4 ) people with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness , and may also be institutionalized for example , william kurelek , later awarded the order of canada for his artistic life work , as a young man was admitted to the maudsley hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia british journal of psychiatry ( 2001 ) he was transferred from the maudsley to netherne hospital from november 1953 to january 1955 , to work with edward adamson ( 1911–1996 ) , a pioneer of art therapy , and creator of the adamson collection jean dubuffet and art brut france artist jean dubuffet was particularly struck by bildnerei der geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art , which he called art brut or raw art the collection he established became known as the collection de l'art brut dubuffet characterized art brut as : : '' those works created from solitude and from pure and authentic creative impulses – where the worries of competition , acclaim and social promotion do not interfere – are , because of these very facts , more precious than the productions of professionals after a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness , lived so fully and so intensely by their authors , we can not avoid the feeling that in relation to these works , cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society , a fallacious parade p.36 dubuffet 's writing on art brut was the subject of a noted program at the art club of chicago in the early 1950s dubuffet argued that 'culture ' , that is mainstream culture , managed to assimilate every new development in art , and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had the interest in '' outsider '' practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu the early part of the 20th century gave rise to cubism and the dada , constructivist and futurist movements in art , all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past dadaist marcel duchamp , for example , abandoned '' painterly '' technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works , or simply to re-contextualize existing '' readymade '' objects as art mid-century artists , including pablo picasso , looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration , drawing from the artifacts of '' primitive '' societies , the unschooled artwork of children , and vulgar advertising graphics definitions of these terms vary and overlap consequently , they lament the use of '' outsider artist '' to refer to almost any untrained artist outsider art is virtually synonymous with art brut in both spirit and meaning , to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name '' art brut : literally translated from french means '' raw art '' ; 'raw ' in that it has not been through the 'cooking ' process : the world of art schools , galleries , museums originally art by psychotic individuals who existed almost completely outside culture and society folk art : folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in europe – though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture intuitive art/visionary art : raw vision magazines preferred general terms for outsider art intuit : the center for intuitive and outsider art based in chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art marginal art/art singulier : essentially the same as neuve invention ; refers to artists on the margins of the art world naïve art : another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to '' normal '' artistic status , i.e they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists the expression was coined by dubuffet too ; strictly speaking it refers only to a special part of the collection de l'art brut examples include watts towers by simon rodia , buddha park and sala keoku by bunleua sulilat , and the palais ideal by ferdinand cheval most of the works for which he is best known were created while he was a patient in bethlem and broadmoor psychiatric hospitals her paintings and modified photos which are shown in galleries and museums such as the hayward gallery in london and the smithsonian american art museum george paul kornegay ( 1913–2014 ) created a large christian visionary environment from found objects on a hill near his home in brent , alabama abandoning his monumental life 's work , he returned to die with his family , among whom he was regarded as a bum , artist , crazy or a genius a mathematical savant , he hand draws obsessive fractal patterns on grid paper using art pens despite his expulsion from high school , his works contain complex literary elements , often weaving the painting into a full story in relatively few words greg bottoms , i colori dell'apocalisse – viaggi nell'outsider art , odoya , bologna 2009 greg bottoms , the colorful apocalypse : journeys in outsider art , chicago : university of chicago press , 2007 roger cardinal , outsider art , london , 1972 hal foster , blinded insight : on the modernist reception of the art of the mentally ill self taught artists of the 20th century : an american anthology san francisco : chronicle books , 1998 daniel wojcik , outsider art : visionary worlds and trauma

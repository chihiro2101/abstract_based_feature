art of the mentally ill interest in the art of the mentally ill , along with children 's art and the makers of '' folk art '' , was first demonstrated by '' der blaue reiter '' group : wassily kandinsky , auguste macke , franz marc , alexej jawlensky , and others examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication , der blaue reiter almanac interest in the art of insane asylum inmates continued to grow in the 1920s walter morgenthaler published his book ein geisteskranker als künstler ( a psychiatric patient as artist ) about adolf wölfli , a psychotic mental patient in his care wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works , some of which were sold or given as gifts his work is on display at the adolf wölfli foundation in the museum of fine art , bern the book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time , including paul klee , max ernst , and jean dubuffet '' outsider art sourcebook '' ( raw vision , watford , 2009 , p.4 ) people with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness , and may also be institutionalized for example , william kurelek , later awarded the order of canada for his artistic life work , as a young man was admitted to the maudsley hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia british journal of psychiatry ( 2001 ) he was transferred from the maudsley to netherne hospital from november 1953 to january 1955 , to work with edward adamson ( 1911–1996 ) , a pioneer of art therapy , and creator of the adamson collection jean dubuffet and art brut france artist jean dubuffet was particularly struck by bildnerei der geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art , which he called art brut or raw art in 1948 he formed the compagnie de l'art brut along with other artists , including andré breton the collection he established became known as the collection de l'art brut after a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness , lived so fully and so intensely by their authors , we can not avoid the feeling that in relation to these works , cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society , a fallacious parade p.36 dubuffet 's writing on art brut was the subject of a noted program at the art club of chicago in the early 1950s dubuffet argued that 'culture ' , that is mainstream culture , managed to assimilate every new development in art , and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut was immune to the influences of culture , immune to being absorbed and assimilated , because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated the interest in '' outsider '' practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu the early part of the 20th century gave rise to cubism and the dada , constructivist and futurist movements in art , all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past dubuffet 's championing of the art brut – of the insane and others at the margins of society – is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values consequently , they lament the use of '' outsider artist '' to refer to almost any untrained artist outsider art is virtually synonymous with art brut in both spirit and meaning , to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name '' art brut : literally translated from french means '' raw art '' ; 'raw ' in that it has not been through the 'cooking ' process : the world of art schools , galleries , museums originally art by psychotic individuals who existed almost completely outside culture and society however , visionary art unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works , which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature intuitive art is probably the most general term available intuit : the center for intuitive and outsider art based in chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art the american visionary art museum in baltimore , maryland is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art naïve art : another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to '' normal '' artistic status , i.e they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists neuve invention : used to describe artists who , although marginal , have some interaction with mainstream culture nick blinko ( born 1961 ) is an english musician and artist diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder al carbee ( 1914–2005 ) was a prolific , multi-format artist who is known for his barbie collages when carbee was in his 80s , his art was discovered accidentally by filmmaker jeremy workman , leading to a flurry of interest in his later years nek chand ( 1924–2015 ) was an indian artist , famous for building the rock garden of chandigarh , a forty-acre ( 160,000 & nbsp ;

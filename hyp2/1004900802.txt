interest in the art of the mentally ill , along with children 's art and the makers of '' folk art '' , was first demonstrated by '' der blaue reiter '' group : wassily kandinsky , auguste macke , franz marc , alexej jawlensky , and others what the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication during world war i , macke was killed at champagne in 1914 and marc was killed at verdun in 1916 ; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by paul klee , who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives ' walter morgenthaler published his book ein geisteskranker als künstler ( a psychiatric patient as artist ) about adolf wölfli , a psychotic mental patient in his care his work is on display at the adolf wölfli foundation in the museum of fine art , bern the book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time , including paul klee , max ernst , and jean dubuffet for example , william kurelek , later awarded the order of canada for his artistic life work , as a young man was admitted to the maudsley hospital where he was treated for schizophrenia cornell case study : early onset schizophrenia – william kurelek in the hospital he painted , producing the maze , a dark depiction of his tortured youth british journal of psychiatry ( 2001 ) he was transferred from the maudsley to netherne hospital from november 1953 to january 1955 , to work with edward adamson ( 1911–1996 ) , a pioneer of art therapy , and creator of the adamson collection jean dubuffet and art brut france artist jean dubuffet was particularly struck by bildnerei der geisteskranken and began his own collection of such art , which he called art brut or raw art in 1948 he formed the compagnie de l'art brut along with other artists , including andré breton the collection he established became known as the collection de l'art brut dubuffet argued that 'culture ' , that is mainstream culture , managed to assimilate every new development in art , and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut was immune to the influences of culture , immune to being absorbed and assimilated , because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated the interest in '' outsider '' practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the modernist art milieu the early part of the 20th century gave rise to cubism and the dada , constructivist and futurist movements in art , all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past dubuffet 's championing of the art brut – of the insane and others at the margins of society – is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values outsider art is virtually synonymous with art brut in both spirit and meaning , to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name '' art brut : literally translated from french means '' raw art '' ; 'raw ' in that it has not been through the 'cooking ' process : the world of art schools , galleries , museums folk art : folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in europe – though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture a key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values , where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society 's mainstream intuitive art/visionary art : raw vision magazines preferred general terms for outsider art intuit : the center for intuitive and outsider art based in chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art marginal art/art singulier : essentially the same as neuve invention ; refers to artists on the margins of the art world the expression was coined by dubuffet too ; strictly speaking it refers only to a special part of the collection de l'art brut examples include watts towers by simon rodia , buddha park and sala keoku by bunleua sulilat , and the palais ideal by ferdinand cheval nick blinko ( born 1961 ) is an english musician and artist diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder he is represented in the collection de l'art brut in lausanne carbee was the subject of workman 's documentary film magical universe nek chand ( 1924–2015 ) was an indian artist , famous for building the rock garden of chandigarh , a forty-acre ( 160,000 & nbsp ;

hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity loop-quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by bekenstein and hawking further , it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed in 2014 carlo rovelli and francesca vidotto proposed that there is a planck star inside every black hole based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star furthermore , the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox however recently physicists , such as jack palmer , have started to consider the possibility of measuring quantum gravity effects mostly from astrophysical observations and gravitational wave detectors loop quantum gravity is formulated in a background-independent language in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner in string theory , one generally starts with quantized excitations on top of a classically fixed background lqg differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or kaluza-klein extra dimensions , while the latter requires both to be true there is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory 's predictions of supersymmetry and kaluza–klein extra dimensions most recently , thiemann ( and alumni ) have made progress toward calculating black hole entropy for supergravity in higher dimensions , spinors and twistor theory with loop quantum gravity , and lee smolin et al contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction

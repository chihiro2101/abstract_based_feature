hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star lqc was mainly developed by martin bojowald , it was popularized loop quantum cosmology in scientific american for predicting a big bounce prior to the big bang loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches however , the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory , then quantized , might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory no spacetime is assumed a priori , but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from n -point functions ( correlation function ) and these , formulated in conventional quantum field theory , are functions of points of a background space-time the relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious , and it is far from obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory one would like to derive the n -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism , in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner progress has been made in calculating background independent scattering amplitudes this way with the use of spin foams gravitons , string theory , supersymmetry , extra dimensions in lqg loop quantum gravity , like string theory , also aims to overcome the nonrenormalizable divergences of quantum field theories since lqg has been formulated in 4 dimensions ( with and without supersymmetry ) , and m-theory requires supersymmetry and 11 dimensions , a direct comparison between the two has not been possible contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction while there has been a proposal relating to observation of naked singularity , and doubly special relativity as a part of a program called loop quantum cosmology , there is no experimental observation for which loop quantum gravity makes a prediction not made by the standard model or general relativity ( a problem that plagues all current theories of quantum gravity )

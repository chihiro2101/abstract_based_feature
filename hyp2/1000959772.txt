hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity loop-quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by bekenstein and hawking further , it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed the quantum effects are centered at a set of discrete and unblended frequencies highly pronounced on top of hawking radiation spectrum in 2014 carlo rovelli and francesca vidotto proposed that there is a planck star inside every black hole based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star furthermore , the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox lqc was mainly developed by martin bojowald , it was popularized loop quantum cosmology in scientific american for predicting a big bounce prior to the big bang it has been argued that singularity avoidance in lqc are by mechanisms only available in these restrictive models and that singularity avoidance in the full theory can still be obtained but by a more subtle feature of lqg loop quantum gravity is formulated in a background-independent language in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner gravitons , string theory , supersymmetry , extra dimensions in lqg most recently , thiemann ( and alumni ) have made progress toward calculating black hole entropy for supergravity in higher dimensions also , pullin and gambini provide a framework to connect the path integral and canonical approaches to quantum gravity contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction

hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity loop-quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by bekenstein and hawking further , it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed in 2014 carlo rovelli and francesca vidotto proposed that there is a planck star inside every black hole based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star furthermore , the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches no spacetime is assumed a priori , but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from n -point functions ( correlation function ) and these , formulated in conventional quantum field theory , are functions of points of a background space-time in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner claims to have reproduced the correct behaviour for graviton scattering amplitudes and to have recovered classical gravity have been made '' we have calculated newton 's law starting from a world with no space and no time loop quantum gravity , like string theory , also aims to overcome the nonrenormalizable divergences of quantum field theories , spinors and twistor theory with loop quantum gravity , and lee smolin et al contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction an alternative criticism is that general relativity may be an effective field theory , and therefore quantization ignores the fundamental degrees of freedom

hawking radiation in loop quantum gravity a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity loop-quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by bekenstein and hawking further , it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed the quantum effects are centered at a set of discrete and unblended frequencies highly pronounced on top of hawking radiation spectrum based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star furthermore , the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches however , the results obtained are subject to the usual restriction that a truncated classical theory , then quantized , might not display the true behaviour of the full theory due to artificial suppression of degrees of freedom that might have large quantum fluctuations in the full theory one would like to derive the n -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism , in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit in contrast , loop quantum gravity , like general relativity , is manifestly background independent , eliminating the background required in string theory lqg differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or kaluza-klein extra dimensions , while the latter requires both to be true proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that , among other things , it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits , which loop quantum gravity has struggled to do it would therefore be desirable to have higher-dimensional supergravity loop quantizations at one 's disposal in order to compare these approaches contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction this means it remains unproven that lqgs description of spacetime at the planck scale has the right continuum limit ( described by general relativity with possible quantum corrections )

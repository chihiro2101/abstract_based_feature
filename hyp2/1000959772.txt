a detailed study of the quantum geometry of a black hole horizon has been made using loop quantum gravity loop-quantization reproduces the result for black hole entropy originally discovered by bekenstein and hawking further , it led to the computation of quantum gravity corrections to the entropy and radiation of black holes based on the fluctuations of the horizon area , a quantum black hole exhibits deviations from the hawking spectrum that would be observable were x-rays from hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes to be observed based on lqg , the theory states that as stars are collapsing into black holes , the energy density reaches the planck energy density , causing a repulsive force that creates a star furthermore , the existence of such a star would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is a symmetry-reduced model of classical general relativity quantized using methods that mimic those of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) that predicts a '' quantum bridge '' between contracting and expanding cosmological branches no spacetime is assumed a priori , but rather it is built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from n -point functions ( correlation function ) and these , formulated in conventional quantum field theory , are functions of points of a background space-time one would like to derive the n -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism , in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit in conventional quantum field theory , this boundary amplitude is well–defined and codes the physical information of the theory ; it does so in quantum gravity as well , but in a fully background–independent manner a generally covariant definition of n -point functions can then be based on the idea that the distance between physical points –arguments of the n -point function is determined by the state of the gravitational field on the boundary of the spacetime region considered some quantum theories of gravity posit a spin-2 quantum field that is quantized , giving rise to gravitons lqg differs from string theory in that it is formulated in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or kaluza-klein extra dimensions , while the latter requires both to be true proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that , among other things , it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits , which loop quantum gravity has struggled to do most recently , thiemann ( and alumni ) have made progress toward calculating black hole entropy for supergravity in higher dimensions ) furthermore , lqg has drawn philosophical comparisons with causal dynamical triangulation and asymptotically safe gravity , and the spinfoam with group field theory and ads/cft correspondence contrary to this , lqg is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction

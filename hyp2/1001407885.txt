jpg thumb calf roping as a rodeo event had its origin in ranch work when a calf enters the chute , a door is closed behind it and a lightweight rope , attached to a trip lever , is fastened around the calf 's neck the lever holds a taut cord or '' barrier '' that runs across a large pen or '' box '' at one side of the calf chute , where the horse and rider wait when the calf reaches the end of the rope , that trips the lever , the rope falls off the calf , and the barrier for the horse is released , starting the clock and allowing horse and rider to chase the calf from a standstill , a rider will put his horse into a gallop from the box shortly after the calf leaves the chute , so that the horse saves valuable seconds by being at near-full speed the moment the barrier releases once the rope is around the calf 's neck , the roper signals the horse to stop quickly while he dismounts and runs to the calf once the calf is on the ground , the roper ties three of the calf 's legs together with a short rope known as a tie-down rope or '' piggin ' string '' image : calf roping szmurlo.jpg thumb calf roping event at the calgary stampede when the tie is complete , the roper throws his hands in the air to signal '' time '' and stop the clock in prca events , the calf must weigh between 220 and 280 pounds a 2016 study indicated that the process of calf roping , including being herded in the arena and into the roping chutes , was stressful on the animals as evidenced by eye movement when roped and increases in blood cortisol , epinephrine and nor-epinephrine

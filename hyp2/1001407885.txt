jpg thumb calf roping as a rodeo event had its origin in ranch work when a calf enters the chute , a door is closed behind it and a lightweight rope , attached to a trip lever , is fastened around the calf 's neck the lever holds a taut cord or '' barrier '' that runs across a large pen or '' box '' at one side of the calf chute , where the horse and rider wait when the calf reaches the end of the rope , that trips the lever , the rope falls off the calf , and the barrier for the horse is released , starting the clock and allowing horse and rider to chase the calf from a standstill , a rider will put his horse into a gallop from the box shortly after the calf leaves the chute , so that the horse saves valuable seconds by being at near-full speed the moment the barrier releases however , if the rider mistimes his cue to the horse and the horse breaks the barrier before it releases , a 10-second penalty will be added to his time '' the rider must lasso the calf from horseback by throwing a loop of the lariat around the calf 's neck the calf must be stopped by the rope but can not be thrown to the ground by the rope once the calf is on the ground , the roper ties three of the calf 's legs together with a short rope known as a tie-down rope or '' piggin ' string '' tie-down calf roping is also not allowed in some localities in australia , brazil and canada and banned nationally in the united kingdom , germany and the netherlands

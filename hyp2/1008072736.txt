the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation the earliest crucible forms derive from the sixth/fifth millennium b.c crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time these crucibles have added handles to allow for better manipulation , however , due to the poor preservation of the crucibles there is no evidence of a pouring spout lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 the crucible changed into rounded or pointed bottom vessels with a more conical shape ; these were heated from below , unlike prehistoric types which were irregular in shape and were heated from above these crucibles in some cases have thinner walls and have more refractory properties ( tylecote 1976 : p20 ) during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass this process involves the combination of a metal and a gas to produce an alloy ( zwicker et al this reaction has to take place in a part-closed or closed container otherwise the zinc vapor would escape before it can react with the copper cementation crucibles , therefore , have a lid or cap which limits the amount of gas loss from the crucible these small crucibles are seen in colonia ulpia trajana ( modern-day xanten ) , germany , where the crucibles are around 4 & nbsp ; cm in size , however , these are small examples the ceramic vessels which are used are important as the vessel must be able to lose gas through the walls otherwise the pressure would break the vessel the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles by the late medieval period , steel production had moved from india to modern-day uzbekistan where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles , for example , mullite crucibles were introduced these crucibles were used in the same way as other cementation vessels but with a hole in the top of the vessel to allow pressure to escape smelting and melting crucibles types started to become more limited in designs which are produced by a few specialists these are triangular vessels made on a wheel or within a mold using high alumina clay and tempered with pure quartz sand , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany crucibles and their covers are made of high temperature-resistant materials , usually porcelain , alumina or an inert metal for completely accurate results , the crucible is handled with clean tongs because fingerprints can add a weighable mass to the crucible , 2009 , post medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 o lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 roberts b

the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time 36 , pp2700–2712 during the chalcolithic period , crucibles were heated from the top by using blowpipes the main purpose of the crucible during this period was to keep the ore in the area where the heat was concentrated to separate it from impurities before shaping , 2003 , crucibles as reaction vessels in ancient metallurgy , ed in p lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 the use of crucibles in the iron age remains very similar to that of the bronze age with copper and tin smelting being used to produce bronze during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass the crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles , 1999 , small size , large scale roman brass production in germania inferior , journal of archaeological science , vol 26 , pp 1083–1087 there are examples of larger vessels such as cooking pots and amphorae being used for cementation to process larger amounts of brass ; since the reaction takes place at low temperatures lower fired ceramics could be used the ceramic vessels which are used are important as the vessel must be able to lose gas through the walls otherwise the pressure would break the vessel the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles , 1995 , early metal mining and production , edinburgh university press ltd , edinburgh however , during this period a vast and highly important technological innovation happened using the cementation process , the production of crucible steel the first examples of cementation steel are wootz steel from india ( craddock 1995 : p276 ) , where the crucibles were filled with good quality low-carbon wrought iron and carbon in the form of organics such as leaves , wood , etc by the late medieval period , steel production had moved from india to modern-day uzbekistan where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles , for example , mullite crucibles were introduced at the end of the medieval era and into the post-medieval era , new types of crucible designs and processes started , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany the refining of methods during the medieval and post-medieval periods led to the invention of the cupel which resembles a small egg cup , made of ceramic or bone ash which was used to separate base metals from noble metals , 2009 , post medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 o p , 2009 , a truly refractory crucible from fourth millennium tepe hissar , northeast iran , journal of archaeological science , vol lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 roberts b , 1985 , smelting , refining and alloying of copper and copper alloys in crucible furnaces during prehistoric up to roman times , p

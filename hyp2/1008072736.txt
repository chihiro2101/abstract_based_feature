the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation the earliest crucible forms derive from the sixth/fifth millennium b.c crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time , 2003 , crucibles as reaction vessels in ancient metallurgy , ed in p the use of crucibles in the iron age remains very similar to that of the bronze age with copper and tin smelting being used to produce bronze the roman period shows technical innovations , with crucibles for new methods used to produce new alloys the smelting and melting process also changed with both the heating technique and the crucible design during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass this is heated to about 900 & nbsp ; °c , the zinc oxide vaporizes into a gas , and the zinc gas bonds with the molten copper ( rehren 1999 : p1085 ) cementation crucibles , therefore , have a lid or cap which limits the amount of gas loss from the crucible the crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles , 1999 , small size , large scale roman brass production in germania inferior , journal of archaeological science , vol the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles however , no charcoal was used within the crucible by the late medieval period , steel production had moved from india to modern-day uzbekistan where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles , for example , mullite crucibles were introduced , 2000 , cutting edge technology – the ferghana process of medieval crucible steel smelting , metalla , bochum , 7 ( 2 ) pp55–69 these were sandy clay crucibles which had been formed around a fabric tube these crucibles were used in the same way as other cementation vessels but with a hole in the top of the vessel to allow pressure to escape the crucible and lid to be used are pre-weighed very accurately on an analytical balance for this reason , the porcelain crucible and lid is also pre-fired ( pre-heating to high temperature ) to constant mass before the pre-weighing the desiccator contains desiccant to absorb moisture from the air inside , so the air inside will be completely dry , 2000 , cutting edge technology – the ferghana process of medieval crucible steel smelting , metalla , bochum , 7 ( 2 ) pp55–69 rehren t , 1999 , small size , large scale roman brass production in germania inferior , journal of archaeological science , vol , 1985 , smelting , refining and alloying of copper and copper alloys in crucible furnaces during prehistoric up to roman times , p

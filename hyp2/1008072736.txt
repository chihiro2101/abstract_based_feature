the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time p , 2009 , a truly refractory crucible from fourth millennium tepe hissar , northeast iran , journal of archaeological science , vol 36 , pp2700–2712 during the chalcolithic period , crucibles were heated from the top by using blowpipes these crucibles have added handles to allow for better manipulation , however , due to the poor preservation of the crucibles there is no evidence of a pouring spout , 2003 , crucibles as reaction vessels in ancient metallurgy , ed in p the use of crucibles in the iron age remains very similar to that of the bronze age with copper and tin smelting being used to produce bronze the smelting and melting process also changed with both the heating technique and the crucible design during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass this reaction has to take place in a part-closed or closed container otherwise the zinc vapor would escape before it can react with the copper these small crucibles are seen in colonia ulpia trajana ( modern-day xanten ) , germany , where the crucibles are around 4 & nbsp ; cm in size , however , these are small examples , 1999 , small size , large scale roman brass production in germania inferior , journal of archaeological science , vol cementation vessels are mass-produced due to crucibles having to be broken open to remove the brass once the reaction has finished as in most cases the lid would have baked hard to the vessel or the brass might have adhered to the vessel walls the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles , 2000 , cutting edge technology – the ferghana process of medieval crucible steel smelting , metalla , bochum , 7 ( 2 ) pp55–69 these were sandy clay crucibles which had been formed around a fabric tube , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany cupellation started long before the post medieval period , however , the first vessels made to carry out this process started in the 16th century ( rehren 2003 : p208 ) crucibles and their covers are made of high temperature-resistant materials , usually porcelain , alumina or an inert metal after some possible washing and/or pre-drying of this filtrate , the residue on the filter paper can be placed in the crucible and fired ( heated at very high temperature ) until all the volatiles and moisture are driven out of the sample residue in the crucible the mass of the empty , pre-weighed crucible and lid is subtracted from this result to yield the mass of the completely dried residue in the crucible p , 2009 , a truly refractory crucible from fourth millennium tepe hissar , northeast iran , journal of archaeological science , vol lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 roberts b , 1985 , smelting , refining and alloying of copper and copper alloys in crucible furnaces during prehistoric up to roman times , p

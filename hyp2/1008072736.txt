the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation the earliest crucible forms derive from the sixth/fifth millennium b.c crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time p , 2009 , a truly refractory crucible from fourth millennium tepe hissar , northeast iran , journal of archaeological science , vol these crucibles have added handles to allow for better manipulation , however , due to the poor preservation of the crucibles there is no evidence of a pouring spout the main purpose of the crucible during this period was to keep the ore in the area where the heat was concentrated to separate it from impurities before shaping , 2003 , crucibles as reaction vessels in ancient metallurgy , ed in p lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 the smelting and melting process also changed with both the heating technique and the crucible design these crucibles in some cases have thinner walls and have more refractory properties ( tylecote 1976 : p20 ) during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass the crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles the ceramic vessels which are used are important as the vessel must be able to lose gas through the walls otherwise the pressure would break the vessel the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles however , no charcoal was used within the crucible these crucibles were used in the same way as other cementation vessels but with a hole in the top of the vessel to allow pressure to escape these are triangular vessels made on a wheel or within a mold using high alumina clay and tempered with pure quartz sand , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany these had a very similar design to that of the triangular crucibles from hesse but they also occur in conical forms crucibles and their covers are made of high temperature-resistant materials , usually porcelain , alumina or an inert metal in the area of chemical analysis , crucibles are used in quantitative gravimetric chemical analysis ( analysis by measuring mass of an analyte or its derivative ) , 2009 , post medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 o lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 roberts b

the form of the crucibles has varied through time , with designs reflecting the process for which they are used , as well as regional variation crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time p , 2009 , a truly refractory crucible from fourth millennium tepe hissar , northeast iran , journal of archaeological science , vol , 2003 , crucibles as reaction vessels in ancient metallurgy , ed in p lang , mining and metal production through the ages , british museum press , london pp207–215 the iron age crucible designs remain the same as the bronze age the roman period shows technical innovations , with crucibles for new methods used to produce new alloys during the roman period a new process of metalworking started , cementation , used in the production of brass cementation crucibles , therefore , have a lid or cap which limits the amount of gas loss from the crucible the crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles these small crucibles are seen in colonia ulpia trajana ( modern-day xanten ) , germany , where the crucibles are around 4 & nbsp ; cm in size , however , these are small examples , 1999 , small size , large scale roman brass production in germania inferior , journal of archaeological science , vol the ceramic vessels which are used are important as the vessel must be able to lose gas through the walls otherwise the pressure would break the vessel the technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles steel production using iron and carbon works similarly to brass , with the iron metal being mixed with carbon to produce steel however , no charcoal was used within the crucible these early crucibles would only produce a small amount of steel as they would have to be broken once the process has finished by the late medieval period , steel production had moved from india to modern-day uzbekistan where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles , for example , mullite crucibles were introduced at the end of the medieval era and into the post-medieval era , new types of crucible designs and processes started , 2009 , post-medieval crucible production and distribution : a study of materials and materialities , archaeometry vol.51 no.1 pp49–74 furthermore , another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern germany crucibles and their covers are made of high temperature-resistant materials , usually porcelain , alumina or an inert metal the mass of the empty , pre-weighed crucible and lid is subtracted from this result to yield the mass of the completely dried residue in the crucible , 2000 , cutting edge technology – the ferghana process of medieval crucible steel smelting , metalla , bochum , 7 ( 2 ) pp55–69 rehren t

by the medieval period , the mummers play had developed , a form of early street theatre associated with the morris dance , concentrating on themes such as saint george and the dragon and robin hood mystery plays and miracle plays ( sometimes distinguished as two different forms , 'properly speaking , mysteries deal with gospel events only miracle plays , on the other hand , are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the church they developed from the 10th to the 16th century , reaching the height of their popularity in the 15th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre the name derives from mystery used in its sense of miracle , but an occasionally quoted derivation is from misterium , meaning craft , a play performed by the craft guilds there are also the towneley plays of thirty-two pageants , once thought to have been a true 'cycle ' of plays and most likely performed around the corpus christi ( feast ) probably in the town of wakefield , england during the late middle ages until 1576 also extant are two pageants from a new testament coventry mystery plays and one pageant each from norwich and newcastle upon tyne in given cycles , the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging medieval craft guilds the morality play is a genre of medieval and early tudor theatrical entertainment in their own time , these plays were known as '' interludes '' , a broader term given to dramas with or without a moral theme the plays were most popular in europe during the 15th and 16th centuries having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays of the middle ages , they represented a shift towards a more secular base for european theatre the somonyng of everyman ( the summoning of everyman ) , usually referred to simply as everyman , is a late 15th-century english morality play like john bunyan 's 1678 christian novel pilgrim 's progress , everyman examines the question of christian salvation by use of allegorical characters , and what man must do to attain it in the course of the action , everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account all

ralph roister doister ( c during the reign of elizabeth i ( 1558–1603 ) and then james i ( 1603–25 ) , in the late 16th and early 17th century , a london-centred culture , that was both courtly and popular , produced great poetry and drama the earliest elizabethan plays include gorboduc ( 1561 ) by sackville and norton and thomas kyd 's ( 1558–94 ) revenge tragedy the spanish tragedy ( 1592 ) , that influenced shakespeare 's hamlet he was neither a lawyer , nor an aristocrat as the '' university wits '' that had monopolised the english stage when he started writing but shakespeare is remarkable in that he produced all three types in addition , he wrote his so-called '' problem plays '' , or '' bitter comedies '' , that includes , amongst others , measure for measure , troilus and cressida , a winter 's tale and all 's well that ends well his early classical and italianate comedies , like a comedy of errors , containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences , give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies , though most of his plays met with success , it was in his later years , that shakespeare wrote what have been considered his greatest plays : hamlet , othello , king lear , macbeth , antony and cleopatra in his final period , shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays : cymbeline , the winter 's tale and the tempest , as well as the collaboration , pericles , prince of tyre . shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays , henry viii and the two noble kinsmen , probably with john fletcher drawing on german lore , he introduced the story of faust to england in his play doctor faustus ( c one of beaumont and fletcher 's chief merits was that of realising how feudalism and chivalry had turned into snobbery and make-believe and that new social classes were on the rise beaumont 's comedy , the knight of the burning pestle ( 1607 ) , satirises the rising middle class and especially of those nouveaux riches who pretend to dictate literary taste without knowing much literature at all he was also often engaged to write courtly masques , ornate plays where the actors wore masks however , in his best work , characters are '' so vitally rendered as to take on a being that transcends the type '' the restoration plays that have best retained the interest of producers and audiences today are the comedies , such as george etherege 's the man of mode ( 1676 ) , william wycherley 's the country wife ( 1676 ) , john vanbrugh 's the relapse ( 1696 ) , and william congreve 's the way of the world ( 1700 ) '' john mortimer radio plays '' : john mortimer biography ( 1923–2009 ) other notable radio dramatists included brendan behan , and novelist angela carter

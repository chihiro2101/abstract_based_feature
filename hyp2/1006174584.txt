backpacks can often simply be referred to as '' packs '' , especially in outdoors contexts ; though sometimes ambiguous compared to other bags such as saddlebags and duffel bags , context is generally sufficient for identification they are also used in recreational activities , and have long since been used to carry sports equipment and other materials backpacks in general fall into one of four categories : frameless , external frame , internal frame , and bodypack a pack frame , when present , serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately , by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs a bodypack is a backpack fitted with one or more pockets that are suspended on the wearer 's chest and loaded in such a way that the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal the ideal load carrying system should not disturb the wearer 's natural posture , balance and maneuverability sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body , wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running , cycling or hiking compression straps across the top of one 's body are common as are hip belts although daypacks are small averaging ten to thirty litres , all trekking and hiking hydration packs are generally the largest and heaviest external frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads ( > 20 & nbsp ; kg or 40 & nbsp ; lb ) , giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple , frameless strapped bag the external frame is typically made from aluminum , other lightweight metal alloy , and recently reinforced synthetic polymers or plastic and is equipped with a system of straps and tautly-stretched netting which prevents contact between the metal frame and user 's back for this reason , external frame packs are generally considered to be a '' cooler load '' than internal frame designs external frame packs have a fabric '' sack '' portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs , but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items one of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying an internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an internal frame composed of strips of either aluminum , titanium or plastic , sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking , but newer models have improved greatly in these respects common examples include backpacks for small valuable items such as laptops and cameras ; backpacks designed to hold laptop computers in particular generally have a padded compartment to hold the computer and medium-sized pockets and flaps to accommodate accessories such as charger cables and mice because of their design , rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user , though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels hydration packs , sometimes used by athletes and military personnel , carry water ( in either a bladder or a rigid bottle ) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack ; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks

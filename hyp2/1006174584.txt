the word rucksack is a german loanword mainly used in the uk , us and in other western military forces in fact , britons used to call alpine-style backpacks '' bergen rucksacks '' , maybe from the name of their creator , norwegian ole f backpacks can often simply be referred to as '' packs '' , especially in outdoors contexts ; though sometimes ambiguous compared to other bags such as saddlebags and duffel bags , context is generally sufficient for identification they are also used in recreational activities , and have long since been used to carry sports equipment and other materials a pack frame , when present , serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately , by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs a bodypack is a backpack fitted with one or more pockets that are suspended on the wearer 's chest and loaded in such a way that the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal the ideal load carrying system should not disturb the wearer 's natural posture , balance and maneuverability sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body , wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running , cycling or hiking running hydration packs are the smallest and lightest , many under 2 litres and most under six litres external frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads ( > 20 & nbsp ; kg or 40 & nbsp ; lb ) , giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple , frameless strapped bag the external frame is typically made from aluminum , other lightweight metal alloy , and recently reinforced synthetic polymers or plastic and is equipped with a system of straps and tautly-stretched netting which prevents contact between the metal frame and user 's back for this reason , external frame packs are generally considered to be a '' cooler load '' than internal frame designs external frame packs have a fabric '' sack '' portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs , but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes , sizes and weights the other type of external frame which recently was proposed , is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also it is a kind of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature in addition , because of their snug fit , the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities while traditionally very simple in design , school backpacks are often made with padded shoulder straps and backs as well as additional reinforcement to hold large numbers of heavy textbooks , as well as safety features such as reflective panels to make the wearer of the pack more visible at night many police tactical units , as well as players of military-style combat games such as paintball and airsoft , use these military-style tactical backpacks and webbing for storing gear and ammunition hydration packs , sometimes used by athletes and military personnel , carry water ( in either a bladder or a rigid bottle ) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack ; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks

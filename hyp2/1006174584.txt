the word rucksack is a german loanword mainly used in the uk , us and in other western military forces in middle high german ruck ( e ) means '' back '' ( dorsum ) , which lead to the upper german and swiss word ruggsack they are also used in recreational activities , and have long since been used to carry sports equipment and other materials backpacks in general fall into one of four categories : frameless , external frame , internal frame , and bodypack a pack frame , when present , serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately , by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs a bodypack is a backpack fitted with one or more pockets that are suspended on the wearer 's chest and loaded in such a way that the load in the front and the load in the back are close to equal the load must be dispersed onto the skeletal structure in an even manner , and should not produce unbalanced forces on the body this may be combined with webbing or rope straps , while more sophisticated models add extra pockets , waist straps , chest straps , padded shoulder straps , padded backs , and sometimes reflective materials for added safety at night sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body , wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running , cycling or hiking compression straps across the top of one 's body are common as are hip belts although daypacks are small averaging ten to thirty litres , all trekking and hiking hydration packs are generally the largest and heaviest external frame packs have a fabric '' sack '' portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs , but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes , sizes and weights one of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying in addition , because of their snug fit , the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities typical school backpacks generally lack the rigid frame of an outdoor-style backpack and include only a few pockets in the front in addition to the main storage compartment because of their design , rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user , though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels these backpacks are generally very modular , allowing the pack to be reconfigured to the users wishes and are designed to load around the wearers hips hydration packs , sometimes used by athletes and military personnel , carry water ( in either a bladder or a rigid bottle ) and have a tube connected to them from which the wearer can drink without removing the pack ; this feature is also included in some more general-purpose hiking backpacks

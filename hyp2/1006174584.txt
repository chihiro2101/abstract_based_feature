the word rucksack is a german loanword mainly used in the uk , us and in other western military forces the name rucksack is cognate with the danish rygsæk , norwegian ryggsekk , dutch rugzak , afrikaans rugsak , swedish ryggsäck , and russian рюкзак ( rjukzak ) backpacks can often simply be referred to as '' packs '' , especially in outdoors contexts ; though sometimes ambiguous compared to other bags such as saddlebags and duffel bags , context is generally sufficient for identification they are also used in recreational activities , and have long since been used to carry sports equipment and other materials backpacks in general fall into one of four categories : frameless , external frame , internal frame , and bodypack some outdoor packs , particularly those sold for day hikes , ultralight backpacking and mountaineering are sometimes frameless as well sports and hydration backpacks are smaller with a profile closer to the body , wider straps and can come with water bladders and hip belts for running , cycling or hiking although daypacks are small averaging ten to thirty litres , all trekking and hiking hydration packs are generally the largest and heaviest external frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads ( > 20 & nbsp ; kg or 40 & nbsp ; lb ) , giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple , frameless strapped bag wooden pack frames were used for centuries around the world for this reason , external frame packs are generally considered to be a '' cooler load '' than internal frame designs external frame packs have a fabric '' sack '' portion which is usually smaller than that of internal frame packs , but have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to accommodate attachment of larger items in addition , the sack can often be removed entirely , permitting the user to customize the configuration of their load , or to transport a non-conventional load such as a quartered game animal military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes , sizes and weights the other type of external frame which recently was proposed , is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also it is a kind of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature in this type of backpack , load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps one of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying because of their design , rolling backpacks reduce the strain on the user , though the shoulder straps may be used to carry the pack for short distances when the terrain is not suitable for wheels backpacks are sometimes used as luggage , particularly as carry-on bags for airplane travel

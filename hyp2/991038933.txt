the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation the pelvis , associated ligaments and muscles provide a floor for the pelvic structures the joints between bones allow movement , some allowing a wider range of movement than others , e.g movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles , bones , and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement , all coordinated by the nervous system it is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement the rib cage , spine , and sternum protect the lungs , heart and major blood vessels the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis , the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow in children , haematopoiesis occurs primarily in the marrow of the long bones such as the femur and tibia however , bones are not entirely made of calcium , but a mixture of chondroitin sulfate and hydroxyapatite , the latter making up 70 % of a bone anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas , but tend to be limited in the skeleton the most common form of arthritis , osteoarthritis , can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton for this reason , dexa scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors , who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture calcium supplements may also be advised , as may vitamin d list of bones of the human skeleton distraction osteogenesis

the axial skeleton ( 80 bones ) is formed by the vertebral column ( 32â€“34 bones ; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts , sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length ) , a part of the rib cage ( 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum ) , and the skull ( 22 bones and 7 associated bones ) the appendicular skeleton ( 126 bones ) is formed by the pectoral girdles , the upper limbs , the pelvic girdle or pelvis , and the lower limbs their functions are to make locomotion possible and to protect the major organs of digestion , excretion and reproduction the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones it is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis , the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas , but tend to be limited in the skeleton the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis are exhibited across human populations in general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population the human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones , specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity , ilia , greater sciatic notches , and the sub-pubic angle also common is scoliosis , a side-to-side curve in the back or spine , often creating a pronounced '' c '' or '' s '' shape when viewed on an x-ray of the spine when medication is used , it may include bisphosphonates , strontium ranelate , and osteoporosis may be one factor considered when commencing hormone replacement therapy list of bones of the human skeleton distraction osteogenesis

the upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton , which transmits the weight from the head , the trunk , and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints the appendicular skeleton ( 126 bones ) is formed by the pectoral girdles , the upper limbs , the pelvic girdle or pelvis , and the lower limbs the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation the skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape the joints between bones allow movement , some allowing a wider range of movement than others , e.g movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles , bones , and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement , all coordinated by the nervous system the skeleton helps to protect our many vital internal organs from being damaged the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis , the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas , but tend to be limited in the skeleton the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis are exhibited across human populations in general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population long bones are generally larger in males than in females within a given population muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females , reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes list of bones of the human skeleton distraction osteogenesis

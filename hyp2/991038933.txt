the axial skeleton ( 80 bones ) is formed by the vertebral column ( 32â€“34 bones ; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts , sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length ) , a part of the rib cage ( 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum ) , and the skull ( 22 bones and 7 associated bones ) the upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton , which transmits the weight from the head , the trunk , and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints the appendicular skeleton ( 126 bones ) is formed by the pectoral girdles , the upper limbs , the pelvic girdle or pelvis , and the lower limbs the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles , bones , and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement , all coordinated by the nervous system it is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis , the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas , but tend to be limited in the skeleton the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis are exhibited across human populations the human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones , specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity , ilia , greater sciatic notches , and the sub-pubic angle the most common form of arthritis , osteoarthritis , can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton it enumerates six types of dislocations , twelve varieties of fractures , and classification of the bone and their reaction to the injuries , and gives a classification of eye diseases including cataract leonardo da vinci , among his many talents , also contributed to the study of the skeleton , albeit unpublished in his time list of bones of the human skeleton distraction osteogenesis

the axial skeleton ( 80 bones ) is formed by the vertebral column ( 32â€“34 bones ; the number of the vertebrae differs from human to human as the lower 2 parts , sacral and coccygeal bone may vary in length ) , a part of the rib cage ( 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum ) , and the skull ( 22 bones and 7 associated bones ) the upright posture of humans is maintained by the axial skeleton , which transmits the weight from the head , the trunk , and the upper extremities down to the lower extremities at the hip joints the appendicular skeleton ( 126 bones ) is formed by the pectoral girdles , the upper limbs , the pelvic girdle or pelvis , and the lower limbs the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation the skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape the joints between bones allow movement , some allowing a wider range of movement than others , e.g movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles , bones , and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement , all coordinated by the nervous system the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis are exhibited across human populations a variety of gross morphological traits of the human skull demonstrate sexual dimorphism , such as the nuchal lines , mastoid processes , supraorbital margin , supraorbital ridge , and the chin the human pelvis exhibits greater sexual dimorphism than other bones , specifically in the size and shape of the pelvic cavity , ilia , greater sciatic notches , and the sub-pubic angle the phenice method is commonly used to determine the sex of an unidentified human skeleton by anthropologists with 96 % to 100 % accuracy in some populations when affected by arthritis , the joint or joints affected may be painful to move , may move in unusual directions or may be immobile completely the most common form of arthritis , osteoarthritis , can affect both the larger and smaller joints of the human skeleton list of bones of the human skeleton distraction osteogenesis

the bones of the spine are supported by many ligaments the appendicular skeleton ( 126 bones ) is formed by the pectoral girdles , the upper limbs , the pelvic girdle or pelvis , and the lower limbs the skeleton serves six major functions : support , movement , protection , production of blood cells , storage of minerals and endocrine regulation the skeleton provides the framework which supports the body and maintains its shape the joints between bones allow movement , some allowing a wider range of movement than others , e.g movement is powered by skeletal muscles , which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones muscles , bones , and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement , all coordinated by the nervous system it is believed that the reduction of human bone density in prehistoric times reduced the agility and dexterity of human movement shifting from hunting to agriculture has caused human bone density to reduce significantly the skeleton is the site of haematopoiesis , the development of blood cells that takes place in the bone marrow anatomical differences between human males and females are highly pronounced in some soft tissue areas , but tend to be limited in the skeleton the human skeleton is not as sexual dimorphism as that of many other primate species , but subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull , dentition , long bones , and pelvis are exhibited across human populations in general , female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements within a given population muscle attachment sites on long bones are often more robust in males than in females , reflecting a difference in overall muscle mass and development between sexes list of bones of the human skeleton distraction osteogenesis

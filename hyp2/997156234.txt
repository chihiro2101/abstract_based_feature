four factors , separately or in combination , can create rapids : gradient , constriction , obstruction , and flow rate this loss determines the river 's slope , and to a large extent its rate of flow ( velocity ) constrictions can form a rapid when a river 's flow is forced into a narrower channel ( holes , or hydraulics , are so-called because their foamy , aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface in large rivers with high flow rates next to an obstruction , '' eddy walls '' can occur this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow a marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid , '' wash out '' a rapid ( decreasing the hazard ) , or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) a rapid 's grade is not fixed , since it may vary greatly depending on the water depth and speed of flow rapids that would have meant almost certain death a hundred years ago may now be considered only a class iv or v rapid , due to the development of certain safety features although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous at flood stage , even rapids that are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards ( briefly adapted from the american version of the international scale of river difficulty ) class 6 : while some debate exists over the term '' class 6 '' , in practice it refers to rapids that are not passable and any attempt to do so would result in serious injury , near drowning , or death ( e.g on any given rapid , a multitude of different features can arise from the interplay between the shape of the riverbed and the velocity of the water in the stream strainers are formed when an object blocks the passage of larger objects , but allows the flow of water to continue - like a big food strainer or colander strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore , exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river and form strainers since it is an obstruction from above , it often does not contribute to whitewater features , but may create turbulence holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object holes can be particularly dangerous—a boater or watercraft may become stuck under the surface in the recirculating water—or entertaining play-spots , where paddlers use the holes ' features to perform various playboating moves in high-volume water flows , holes can subtly aerate the water , enough to allow craft to fall through the aerated water to the bottom of a deep 'hole ' pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction , causing water to '' pile up '' or '' boil '' against the face of the obstruction here is a short list of them : whitewater kayaks differ from sea kayaks and recreational kayaks in that they are better specialized to deal with moving water most whitewater kayaks are made of plastics now , although some paddlers ( especially racers and '' squirt boaters '' ) use kayaks made of fiberglass composites rafts sometimes have inflatable floors , with holes around the edges , that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow to the side and out the bottom ( these are typically called '' self-bailers '' because the occupants do not have to '' bail '' water out with a bucket ) fluid dynamics and turbulence for an academic explanation of whitewater features list of whitewater rivers slalom canoeing river surfing

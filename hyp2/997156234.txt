four factors , separately or in combination , can create rapids : gradient , constriction , obstruction , and flow rate flow rate is dependent upon both seasonal variation in precipitation and snowmelt and upon release rates of upstream dams increased flow , as during a flood or high-rainfall season , can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders , by deposition of alluvium , or by creating new channels for flowing water the gradient of a river is the rate at which it changes elevation along its course this loss determines the river 's slope , and to a large extent its rate of flow ( velocity ) constrictions can form a rapid when a river 's flow is forced into a narrower channel ( holes , or hydraulics , are so-called because their foamy , aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface in large rivers with high flow rates next to an obstruction , '' eddy walls '' can occur an eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow a marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid , '' wash out '' a rapid ( decreasing the hazard ) , or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) harder rapids ( for example a grade-v rapid on a mainly grade-iii river ) are often portaged , a french term for carrying although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous strainers are formed when an object blocks the passage of larger objects , but allows the flow of water to continue - like a big food strainer or colander their trunks and branches may form an obstruction in the river like strainers since it is an obstruction from above , it often does not contribute to whitewater features , but may create turbulence in fast water , sweepers can pose a serious hazard to paddlers holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object in high-volume water flows , holes can subtly aerate the water , enough to allow craft to fall through the aerated water to the bottom of a deep 'hole ' pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction , causing water to '' pile up '' or '' boil '' against the face of the obstruction a particularly notorious undercut rock is dimple rock , in dimple rapid on the lower youghiogheny river , a very popular rafting and kayaking river in pennsylvania here is a short list of them : whitewater kayaks differ from sea kayaks and recreational kayaks in that they are better specialized to deal with moving water while most rafts are large multipassenger craft , the smallest rafts are single-person whitewater craft , see packraft fluid dynamics and turbulence for an academic explanation of whitewater features list of whitewater rivers slalom canoeing river surfing

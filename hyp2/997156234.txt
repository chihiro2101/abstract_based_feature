four factors , separately or in combination , can create rapids : gradient , constriction , obstruction , and flow rate this loss determines the river 's slope , and to a large extent its rate of flow ( velocity ) constrictions can form a rapid when a river 's flow is forced into a narrower channel this pressure causes the water to flow more rapidly and to react to riverbed events ( rocks , drops , etc a boulder or ledge in the middle of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river , and can also create a '' pillow '' ; when water flows backwards upstream of the obstruction , or a '' pour over '' ( over the boulder ) ; and '' hydraulics '' or '' holes '' where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp ( holes , or hydraulics , are so-called because their foamy , aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface ) if the flow passes next to the obstruction , an eddy may form behind the obstruction ; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest , scout , or leave the main current , they may be swirling and whirlpool-like an eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow a marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid , '' wash out '' a rapid ( decreasing the hazard ) , or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) the grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid , with grade i referring to flat or slow-moving water with few hazards , and grade vi referring to the hardest rapids , which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers , and are rarely run harder rapids ( for example a grade-v rapid on a mainly grade-iii river ) are often portaged , a french term for carrying although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous at flood stage , even rapids that are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards ( briefly adapted from the american version of the international scale of river difficulty ) class 6 : while some debate exists over the term '' class 6 '' , in practice it refers to rapids that are not passable and any attempt to do so would result in serious injury , near drowning , or death ( e.g strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore , exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river and form strainers since it is an obstruction from above , it often does not contribute to whitewater features , but may create turbulence holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object sometimes , a particularly large wave also is followed by a '' wave train '' , a long series of waves in fluid mechanics , waves are classified as laminar , but the whitewater world has also included waves with turbulence ( '' breaking waves '' ) under the general heading of waves pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction , causing water to '' pile up '' or '' boil '' against the face of the obstruction another major whitewater feature is a sieve , which is a narrow , empty space through which water flows between two obstructions , usually rocks rafts sometimes have inflatable floors , with holes around the edges , that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow to the side and out the bottom ( these are typically called '' self-bailers '' because the occupants do not have to '' bail '' water out with a bucket ) fluid dynamics and turbulence for an academic explanation of whitewater features list of whitewater rivers slalom canoeing river surfing

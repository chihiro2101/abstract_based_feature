four factors , separately or in combination , can create rapids : gradient , constriction , obstruction , and flow rate flow rate is dependent upon both seasonal variation in precipitation and snowmelt and upon release rates of upstream dams increased flow , as during a flood or high-rainfall season , can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders , by deposition of alluvium , or by creating new channels for flowing water the gradient of a river is the rate at which it changes elevation along its course this pressure causes the water to flow more rapidly and to react to riverbed events ( rocks , drops , etc an eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow a marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid , '' wash out '' a rapid ( decreasing the hazard ) , or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) harder rapids ( for example a grade-v rapid on a mainly grade-iii river ) are often portaged , a french term for carrying a portaged rapid is where the boater lands and carries the boat around the hazard a rapid 's grade is not fixed , since it may vary greatly depending on the water depth and speed of flow although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous class 6 : while some debate exists over the term '' class 6 '' , in practice it refers to rapids that are not passable and any attempt to do so would result in serious injury , near drowning , or death ( e.g these objects can be very dangerous , because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up , pushing it down under water their trunks and branches may form an obstruction in the river like strainers since it is an obstruction from above , it often does not contribute to whitewater features , but may create turbulence holes can be particularly dangerous—a boater or watercraft may become stuck under the surface in the recirculating water—or entertaining play-spots , where paddlers use the holes ' features to perform various playboating moves in high-volume water flows , holes can subtly aerate the water , enough to allow craft to fall through the aerated water to the bottom of a deep 'hole ' these standing waves can be smooth , or particularly the larger ones , can be breaking waves ( also called '' whitecaps '' or '' haystacks '' ) another major whitewater feature is a sieve , which is a narrow , empty space through which water flows between two obstructions , usually rocks whitewater kayaks are fairly stable in turbulent water , once the paddler is skillful with them ; if flipped upside-down , the skilled paddler can easily roll them back upright like kayaks , whitewater canoes can be righted after capsizing with an eskimo roll , but this requires more skill in a canoe running whitewater rivers is a popular recreational sport , but is not without danger fluid dynamics and turbulence for an academic explanation of whitewater features list of whitewater rivers slalom canoeing river surfing

four factors , separately or in combination , can create rapids : gradient , constriction , obstruction , and flow rate increased flow , as during a flood or high-rainfall season , can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders , by deposition of alluvium , or by creating new channels for flowing water constrictions can form a rapid when a river 's flow is forced into a narrower channel a boulder or ledge in the middle of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river , and can also create a '' pillow '' ; when water flows backwards upstream of the obstruction , or a '' pour over '' ( over the boulder ) ; and '' hydraulics '' or '' holes '' where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp ( holes , or hydraulics , are so-called because their foamy , aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface ) if the flow passes next to the obstruction , an eddy may form behind the obstruction ; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest , scout , or leave the main current , they may be swirling and whirlpool-like an eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow a marked increase or decrease in flow can create a rapid , '' wash out '' a rapid ( decreasing the hazard ) , or make safe passage through previously navigable rapids more difficult or impossible the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) the grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid , with grade i referring to flat or slow-moving water with few hazards , and grade vi referring to the hardest rapids , which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers , and are rarely run harder rapids ( for example a grade-v rapid on a mainly grade-iii river ) are often portaged , a french term for carrying although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous class 6 : while some debate exists over the term '' class 6 '' , in practice it refers to rapids that are not passable and any attempt to do so would result in serious injury , near drowning , or death ( e.g strainers are formed when an object blocks the passage of larger objects , but allows the flow of water to continue - like a big food strainer or colander these objects can be very dangerous , because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up , pushing it down under water strainers are formed by many natural or man-made objects , such as storm grates over tunnels , trees that have fallen into a river ( '' log jam '' ) , bushes by the side of the river that are flooded during high water , wire fence , rebar from broken concrete structures in the water , or other debris since it is an obstruction from above , it often does not contribute to whitewater features , but may create turbulence in high-volume water flows , holes can subtly aerate the water , enough to allow craft to fall through the aerated water to the bottom of a deep 'hole ' sometimes , a particularly large wave also is followed by a '' wave train '' , a long series of waves pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction , causing water to '' pile up '' or '' boil '' against the face of the obstruction rafts are also often used as a whitewater craft ; more stable than typical kayaks , they are less maneuverable rafts sometimes have inflatable floors , with holes around the edges , that allow water that splashes into the boat to easily flow to the side and out the bottom ( these are typically called '' self-bailers '' because the occupants do not have to '' bail '' water out with a bucket ) others have simple fabric floors , without anyway for water to escape , these are called '' bucket boats '' , both for their tendency to hold water like a bucket , and because the only way to get water out of them is by bailing with a bucket fluid dynamics and turbulence for an academic explanation of whitewater features list of whitewater rivers slalom canoeing river surfing

four factors , separately or in combination , can create rapids : gradient , constriction , obstruction , and flow rate increased flow , as during a flood or high-rainfall season , can make permanent changes to the streambed by displacing rocks and boulders , by deposition of alluvium , or by creating new channels for flowing water this pressure causes the water to flow more rapidly and to react to riverbed events ( rocks , drops , etc ( holes , or hydraulics , are so-called because their foamy , aerated water provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface ) if the flow passes next to the obstruction , an eddy may form behind the obstruction ; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest , scout , or leave the main current , they may be swirling and whirlpool-like an eddy wall is formed when the height of the river is substantially higher than the level of the water in the eddy behind the obstruction this can make it difficult for a boater , who has stopped in that particular eddy , to re-enter the river due to a wall of water that can be several feet high at the point at which the eddy meets the river flow the most widely used grading system is the international scale of river difficulty , where whitewater ( either an individual rapid , or the entire river ) is classed in six categories from class i ( the easiest and safest ) to class vi ( the most difficult and most dangerous ) the grade reflects both the technical difficulty and the danger associated with a rapid , with grade i referring to flat or slow-moving water with few hazards , and grade vi referring to the hardest rapids , which are very dangerous even for expert paddlers , and are rarely run although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or '' washed-out '' , high water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous on any given rapid , a multitude of different features can arise from the interplay between the shape of the riverbed and the velocity of the water in the stream strainers are formed when an object blocks the passage of larger objects , but allows the flow of water to continue - like a big food strainer or colander these objects can be very dangerous , because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up , pushing it down under water since it is an obstruction from above , it often does not contribute to whitewater features , but may create turbulence holes , or '' hydraulics '' , ( also known as '' stoppers '' or '' souse-holes '' ( see also pillows ) are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object , or underwater ledges , causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object holes can be particularly dangerous—a boater or watercraft may become stuck under the surface in the recirculating water—or entertaining play-spots , where paddlers use the holes ' features to perform various playboating moves because of the rough and random pattern of a riverbed , waves are often not perpendicular to the river 's current in fluid mechanics , waves are classified as laminar , but the whitewater world has also included waves with turbulence ( '' breaking waves '' ) under the general heading of waves pillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction , causing water to '' pile up '' or '' boil '' against the face of the obstruction another major whitewater feature is a sieve , which is a narrow , empty space through which water flows between two obstructions , usually rocks thumb people use many types of whitewater craft to make their way down a rapid , preferably with finesse and control they are often shorter and more maneuverable than sea kayaks and are specially designed to deal with water flowing up onto their decks rafts are also often used as a whitewater craft ; more stable than typical kayaks , they are less maneuverable others have simple fabric floors , without anyway for water to escape , these are called '' bucket boats '' , both for their tendency to hold water like a bucket , and because the only way to get water out of them is by bailing with a bucket mckenzie river dory ( or '' drift boat '' by some ) is a more traditional '' hard sided '' boat

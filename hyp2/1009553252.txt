jandek 's first album , ready for the house , though obviously a solo work , was originally credited to a band called the units as explained in an interview in the first issue of spin , smith was forced to change the name the units by an identically named californian group already in possession of a trademark on the name , after scott ryser from the units wrote smith a letter with documentation all reissues of this first album and all subsequent corwood releases have been credited to '' jandek '' in trubee 's interview , smith claims he came up with the name jandek while on the telephone with a person named decker during the month of january smith 's initial use of a plural band name ( and corwood 's curious tendency to refer to as '' a representative from corwood industries '' ) has led some fans to suggest that the reclusive artist intended his oeuvre to be perceived as the work of an anonymous collective rather than that of a single man indeed , though roughly two-thirds of his records are solo affairs , the other third have variably featured female vocalists , different male vocalists , bass guitar , electric guitar , drums , and accordion these contributions are usually credited to outside collaborators , but in the spin interview as well as a letter to dj irwin chusid the artist admitted to having overdubbed parts himself on occasion , such as on the album the rocks crumble no proper credits list has ever appeared on an album , but song titles have included '' nancy sings '' and '' john plays drums '' , though those pieces are two different versions of the same song one early theory suggested that all the music was recorded in a single , feverish , possibly manic phase and that after 19 albums the releases would stop '' then the 22nd album arrived and returned to the acoustic and vocal sound that is found on most of the first six corwood albums ( often referred to as '' the first acoustic phase '' ) this ushered in the most controversial period of albums in corwood 's history â€“ three albums of unaccompanied voice after these albums , though , the direction changed again and jandek returned to a voice and guitar mixture with occasional harmonica , though the approach was different than the earlier recordings further albums have continued the solo approach , though the instrument used has occasionally been a fretless bass , and the songs have stretched progressively longer and the lyrics have become even more personal though corwood still releases albums like this ( the most recent is what was out there disappeared ) , they are now alternated with releases of the live band shows , which are remarkably different and feature unusually tight playing in the 1980s and 1990s most fans stumbled into the world of jandek after hearing his music on college radio or freeform stations like wfmu and wcbn-fm the rep unknowingly gave two unauthorized phone interviews in his entire career , the first conducted by fellow outsider artist john trubee , for the aforementioned spin article in 1985 the spin article was jandek 's first major press ; as the '80s drew to a close , the magazine proclaimed him to be one of the most important artists of the 1980s in a special end-of-decade issue outsider music expert irwin chusid conducted the second interview and brought quite a bit of attention to jandek by including an account of his own dealings with corwood industries in his book songs in the key of z , the accompanying album featuring a track from ready for the house after jandek called him in response to chusid 's request for information corwood 's recommendation of vine for the documentary is seen as essentially endorsing the contents and confirming the authenticity of the texas monthly interview the book , representing jobe 's imagination of a possible biography of the artist , is almost entirely fictional ;

when the franco-dutch war began in may 1672 , french troops quickly overran much of the netherlands , but by july , the dutch position had stabilised in august 1673 , an imperial army entered the rhineland ; facing war on multiple fronts , the french abandoned most of their earlier gains to focus on said theaters , retaining only grave and maastricht in may , the french took the offensive in the franche-comté , while condé 's army in the spanish netherlands remained on the defensive a combined dutch-spanish force under william of orange and count monterrey , governor of the spanish netherlands , spent june and july attempting to bring condé to battle on 23 july , william was joined near nivelles by an imperial force under the comte de souches , a french huguenot exile , increasing his numbers to about 65,000 they hoped to tempt condé into an attack , but he simply shifted his troops ; next day , william proposed moving around seneffe , and into the french rear at 4:00 am on 11 august , the allies set out in three columns , each marching parallel to the french positions , a formation dictated by the poor roads around 10:00 am , de rannes came into contact with vaudémont , who asked william for infantry support ; he was sent three battalions , which he placed near the bridge over the zenne that flowed through seneffe , with his cavalry just behind french military historian de perini puts condé 's casualties as 7,000 dead or wounded , those of the allies as 8,000 , plus 250 prisoners , although this only relates to officers combined with the losses suffered by condé , the allied army was now stronger relative to the french than before seneffe , and william proposed another invasion attempt since his troops would not fight without their guns , and the dutch and spanish could not face the french on their own , this forced the allies to abandon the siege

when the franco-dutch war began in may 1672 , french troops quickly overran much of the netherlands , but by july , the dutch position had stabilised in may , the french took the offensive in the franche-comté , while condé 's army in the spanish netherlands remained on the defensive a combined dutch-spanish force under william of orange and count monterrey , governor of the spanish netherlands , spent june and july attempting to bring condé to battle on 23 july , william was joined near nivelles by an imperial force under the comte de souches , a french huguenot exile , increasing his numbers to about 65,000 concluding these positions were too strong to be attacked from the direction of nivelles , on 9 august the allied army established a line between the villages of arquennes to roux , on the french left they hoped to tempt condé into an attack , but he simply shifted his troops ; next day , william proposed moving around seneffe , and into the french rear he sent 400 light cavalry under saint clar to skirmish with the allied rearguard and slow down their march , while also despatching a cavalry brigade under the marquis de rannes to seize the high ground north of seneffe the allied horse was once again driven from the field , but the french were exhausted , the dutch infantry remained intact , and the ground in front of their position unsuitable for cavalry in any event , they shocked the french court , one contemporary , madame de sévigné , writing to the count of bussy : '' '' we have lost so much by this victory that without the te deum and captured flags at notre dame , we would believe we had lost the battle '' combined with the losses suffered by condé , the allied army was now stronger relative to the french than before seneffe , and william proposed another invasion attempt since his troops would not fight without their guns , and the dutch and spanish could not face the french on their own , this forced the allies to abandon the siege

in such places as the former rapids at laufenburg , it moved in torrents in 1796 , the plain on both sides of the river , some wide , was dotted with villages and farms at both far edges of the flood plain , especially on the eastern side , the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon the tributaries then wind in rivulets through the flood plain to the river 19–20 the rhine river itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty-first century ; the passage from basel to iffezheim was '' corrected '' ( straightened ) between 1817 and 1875 in the 1790s , the river was wild and unpredictable , in some places four or more times wider than the twenty-first century incarnation of the river , even under regular conditions among the german-speaking states , the holy roman empire 's administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords , between jurisdictions , and within jurisdictions in total , charles ’ troops stretched in a line from switzerland to the north sea habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army but the thin white line of habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from basel to frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of the opposition compared to french coverage , charles had half the number of troops covering a 211-mile front , stretching from renchen , near basel to bingen it was an army entirely dependent for support upon the countryside it occupied for provisions and wages until 1796 , wages were paid in the worthless assignat ( france 's paper currency ) ;

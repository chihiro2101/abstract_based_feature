the rhine campaign of 1795 ( april 1795 to january 1796 ) opened when two habsburg armies under the overall command of françois sébastien charles joseph de croix , count of clerfayt defeated an attempt by two republican french armies to cross the rhine river and capture the fortress of mainz at the start of the campaign the french army of the sambre and meuse led by jean-baptiste jourdan confronted clerfayt 's army of the lower rhine in the north , while the french army of rhine and moselle under pichegru lay opposite dagobert sigmund von wurmser 's army in the south the army of the sambre and meuse advanced south to the main river , completely isolating mainz pichegru 's army made a surprise capture of mannheim so that both french armies held significant footholds on the east bank of the rhine pichegru bungled at least one opportunity to seize clerfayt 's supply base in the battle of handschuhsheim with pichegru unexpectedly inactive , clerfayt massed against jourdan , beat him at höchst in october and forced most of the army of the sambre and meuse to retreat to the west bank of the rhine with jourdan temporarily out of the picture , the austrians defeated the left wing of the army of rhine and moselle at the battle of mainz and moved down the west bank in november , clerfayt gave pichegru a drubbing at pfeddersheim and successfully wrapped up the siege of mannheim in january 1796 , clerfayt concluded an armistice with the french , allowing the austrians to retain large portions of the west bank ramsay weston phipps , the armies of the first french republic : volume ii the armées du moselle , du rhin , de sambre-et-meuse , de rhin-et-moselle , us , pickle partners publishing , 2011 ( 1923 & ndash ;

in such places as the former rapids at laufenburg , it moved in torrents the rhine makes a wide , northerly turn , in what is called the rhine knee , and enters the so-called rhine ditch ( rheingraben ) , part of a rift valley bordered by the black forest on the east and vosges mountains on the west tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the black forest , creating deep defiles in the mountains 19–20 the rhine river itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty-first century ; the passage from basel to iffezheim was '' corrected '' ( straightened ) between 1817 and 1875 the german-speaking states on the east bank of the rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in central europe called the holy roman empire their size and influence varied , from the kleinstaaterei , the little states that covered no more than a few square miles , or included several non-contiguous pieces , to the small and complex territories of the princely hohenlohe family branches , to such sizable , well-defined territories as the kingdoms of bavaria and prussia see , for example , james allen vann , the swabian kreis : institutional growth in the holy roman empire 1648–1715 compared to french coverage , charles had half the number of troops covering a 211-mile front , stretching from renchen , near basel to bingen to the north , wilhelm von wartensleben ’ s autonomous corps stretched in a thin line between mainz and giessen in spring 1796 , drafts from the free imperial cities , and other imperial states in the swabian and franconian circles augmented the habsburg force with perhaps 20,000 men at the most an assault into the german states was essential , as far as french commanders understood , not only in terms of war aims , but also in practical terms : the french directory believed that war should pay for itself , and did not budget for the feeding of its troops the french citizen ’ s army , created by mass conscription of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults , had already made itself unwelcome throughout france the 20,000-man right wing under duke ferdinand frederick augustus of württemberg stood on the east bank of the rhine behind the sieg river , observing the french bridgehead at düsseldorf dagobert sigmund von wurmser , who initially commanded the whole operation , led the 80,000-strong army of the upper rhine its right wing occupied kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under anton sztáray , michael von fröhlich and louis joseph , prince of condé guarded the rhine from mannheim to switzerland however , after news arrived in vienna of napoleon bonaparte 's successes in northern italy , wurmser was sent to italy with 25,000 reinforcements ; the aulic council gave archduke charles command over both austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground on this army 's left flank , jean baptiste kléber had 22,000 troops entrenched at düsseldorf the french plan called for its two armies to press against the flanks of the coalition 's northern armies in the german states while simultaneously a third army approached vienna through italy once charles moved the mass of his army to the north , moreau ’ s army , which early in the year had been stationed by speyer , would move swiftly south to strasbourg ideally , this would encircle and trap charles and his army as the left wing of moreau 's army swung behind him , and as jourdan 's force cut off his flank with wartensleben 's autonomous corps on 20 june , his troops assaulted the forward posts between strasbourg and the river , overwhelming the pickets there ; the militia withdrew to kehl , leaving behind their cannons , which solved part of moreau 's artillery problem by turning both latour 's flanks , desaix drove his imperial and habsburg combined force back to the river alb recognizing the need for reinforcements , and fearing his army would be flanked by moreau 's surprise crossings at kehl and hüningen , charles arrived near rastatt with additional troops and prepared to advance against moreau on 10 july

– an allegro , a presto scherzo , an andante sosteunto slow movement joining on without a break to an assai vivace finale & nbsp ; – correspond to the layout of beethoven 's op.59 no.1 5 ( 1974 ) : is dedicated to angela musgrave , who became the composer 's second wife 10 , but is much more turbulent and intense in character : simpson said he was conscious of the influence of beethoven 's f minor quartet , op.95 in this work ;

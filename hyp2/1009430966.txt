cello concerto ( 1991 ) : a one-movement variation-form work of twenty-three minutes duration , commissioned by and dedicated to the cellist raphael wallfisch the quartet is dedicated to george enescu it is cast in a single movement and a single metronome mark , within which three themes ( and three tempi ) contest for dominance 3 ( 1953–54 ) : is in two movements , slow and quick : an adagio in c major and a pulsing allegro deciso that works round to an affirmative e major ( simpson made a transcription of this movement as an independent piece for full string orchestra ) simpson stated that string quartets nos the three simpson quartets offer , in his own idiom , '' musical analogies '' to the procedures of beethoven 's three quartets , but they can be performed without reference to the beethoven and indeed without reference to each other the four movements & nbsp ; – an allegro , a presto scherzo , an andante sosteunto slow movement joining on without a break to an assai vivace finale & nbsp ; – correspond to the layout of beethoven 's op.59 no.1 the work is in a single movement and makes much use of the open strings of the instruments , whose tuning simpson likened to the forces of gravity 10 , but is much more turbulent and intense in character : simpson said he was conscious of the influence of beethoven 's f minor quartet , op.95 in this work ; clarinet quintet ( 1968 ) : this is a large-scale work in five movements forming an arch shape & nbsp ; – a central scherzo of some 800 bars is framed by two slow movements , which themselves are framed by two outer fast movements the entire basis of the material for the work is outlined in the opening introduction , with the main theme having some sort of parallel with beethoven 's c sharp minor quartet as a writer on music ( he would have disavowed the title 'musicologist ' ) , simpson was guided by his deep admiration for tovey 's ability to discuss a composer 's sophisticated treatment of forms and keys in a manner that was accurate and incisive without ever alienating the non-specialist reader foreword to : beethoven , sibelius and the 'profound logic ' : studies in symphonic analysis '' , by lionel pike ( 1978 ) 'fiftieth birthday essays ' : a tribute to robert simpson , with articles by jascha horenstein , robert layton , hans keller , hugh ottoway , peter dobson and ainslee cox robert simpson society discography , bibliography and biographical information with a members ' forum article about robert simpson by malcolm macdonald robert simpson interview , 5 january 1991

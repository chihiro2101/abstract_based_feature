in 1951 he joined the music staff of the bbc and became one of its best-known and most respected music producers , remaining with the corporation for nearly three decades simpson was a great champion of havergal brian 's music , and under the bbc 's auspices he produced many broadcasts featuring brian 's works these included the mammoth '' gothic '' symphony in 1966 under sir adrian boult , and in 1973 the 28th symphony under leopold stokowski who , at the age of 91 , was premiering a work written by a 91-year-old composer simpson married bessie fraser in 1946 ; she died in 1981 and the following year he married angela musgrave , a fellow bbc employee and relative of composer thea musgrave in the latter part of his career as a bbc producer simpson frequently clashed with the management of the organisation a decade later simpson was energetic in his opposition to a cost-cutting reorganisation that ultimately proposed the decommissioning of five of the eleven bbc orchestras he was awarded many honours , including the carl nielsen gold medal , 1956 ( for his book carl nielsen , symphonist , published in 1952 ) , and the medal of honor of the bruckner society of america , 1962 dedicated as he was to renewing the classical tradition of a dynamic musical architecture built on the gravitational power of tonality , simpson wrote very few small or occasional works and concentrated on large-scale genres variation form was important to him , and in addition to variation-movements on his own themes he composed orchestral variations on themes of nielsen and johann sebastian bach , as well as a set of piano variations on a palindromic theme by haydn to which he returned in his large-scale string quartet no 4–6 can be regarded as variations upon the compositional processes , rather than the themes , of beethoven 's three rasumovsky quartets , op the trouble is that the symphony as an abstraction does not exist : there may be exhausted symphonies and exhausted composers , but the response to a challenge to one 's capacity for large-scale organisation and development & nbsp ; – that can be exhausted only in individuals 7 ( 1977 ) , dedicated to hans keller and his wife , the artist milein cosman symphony no 11 ( 1990 ) , dedicated to matthew taylor from 1987 to 1996 vernon handley recorded all but one of the symphonies for hyperion records , with the royal philharmonic orchestra ( in 1 , 3 , 5 and 8 ) , the bournemouth symphony orchestra ( 2 , 4 and 9 ) and the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra ( 6 , 7 and 10 ) simpson had considered revising the work , and matthew taylor has reworked the composition to fulfil simpson 's original intentions ; piano concerto ( 1967 ) : a one-movement twenty-minute work , falling into several sections and written for the pianist john ogdon simpson composed 15 numbered string quartets ; a quartet preceding this sequence was written as part of his course at durham university and still exists there ) in programme notes for a recital consisting of quartets nos 1 ( 1951–52 ) : is in two movements , quick and slow ; the second movement is a set of variations on a palindromic theme stated by the viola there is a power-struggle by the opposed tonal centres of e flat and a : e flat is the focus of the first movement and beats off the challenge of a , the second movement theme starts and ends in e flat with a central climax in a ; the variations work round to a major , in which key the work ends it is cast in a single movement and a single metronome mark , within which three themes ( and three tempi ) contest for dominance 3 ( 1953–54 ) : is in two movements , slow and quick : an adagio in c major and a pulsing allegro deciso that works round to an affirmative e major 1–3 , constituted '' a close study of beethoven 's three rasumovsky quartets , op the four movements & nbsp ; – an allegro molto with a written-out literal repeat of the exposition , an adagio , sempre semplice , an allegretto vivace and a whirlwind prestissimo finale & nbsp ; – correspond to the layout of beethoven 's op 6 ( 1975 ) : is dedicated to the film-maker barrie gavin and his wife jamila the work is in a single movement and makes much use of the open strings of the instruments , whose tuning simpson likened to the forces of gravity the slow , final coda is one of the darkest endings in all string chamber music literature 'ianus germinus : music in scandinavia ' ( 1960 ) , in twentieth century music & nbsp ;

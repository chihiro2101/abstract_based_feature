his father , robert warren simpson , was a descendant of sir james young simpson , the scottish pioneer of anaesthetics ; his mother , helena hendrika govaars , was the daughter of gerrit govaars , founder of the , the dutch arm of the salvation army he was intended for a medical career and studied in london for two years before his determination to be a musician gained the upper hand a conscientious objector in world war ii , he served with an arp mobile surgical unit during the london blitz , while taking lessons from herbert howells howells persuaded him to take the durham university bachelor of music degree , and in 1952 he gained the further degree of doctor of music from that university , the submitted work being his first symphony after the war simpson lectured extensively and founded the exploratory concerts society ; in 1951 he joined the music staff of the bbc and became one of its best-known and most respected music producers , remaining with the corporation for nearly three decades simpson was a great champion of havergal brian 's music , and under the bbc 's auspices he produced many broadcasts featuring brian 's works these included the mammoth '' gothic '' symphony in 1966 under sir adrian boult , and in 1973 the 28th symphony under leopold stokowski who , at the age of 91 , was premiering a work written by a 91-year-old composer simpson married bessie fraser in 1946 ; she died in 1981 and the following year he married angela musgrave , a fellow bbc employee and relative of composer thea musgrave in the 1970s he was one of those & nbsp ; – hans keller and deryck cooke were others & nbsp ; – who started the ( unsuccessful ) revolt against the report broadcasting in the seventies and its plan for '' generic broadcasting '' ( i.e hans keller , 'an untainted mass medium ' , the spectator , 20 december 1980 ) had simpson remained silent for a few more months he would have been able to retire with a full pension , but his feeling was that such a course would have compromised his principles abominating the ethos of thatcherite britain , in 1986 he moved to the republic of ireland , settling on tralee bay in kerry dedicated as he was to renewing the classical tradition of a dynamic musical architecture built on the gravitational power of tonality , simpson wrote very few small or occasional works and concentrated on large-scale genres the trouble is that the symphony as an abstraction does not exist : there may be exhausted symphonies and exhausted composers , but the response to a challenge to one 's capacity for large-scale organisation and development & nbsp ; – that can be exhausted only in individuals robert simpson is said to have written and destroyed four symphonies ( one of which even used serial procedures ) before his first published symphony 11 ( 1990 ) , dedicated to matthew taylor from 1987 to 1996 vernon handley recorded all but one of the symphonies for hyperion records , with the royal philharmonic orchestra ( in 1 , 3 , 5 and 8 ) , the bournemouth symphony orchestra ( 2 , 4 and 9 ) and the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra ( 6 , 7 and 10 ) ; flute concerto ( 1989 ) : a one movement work of twenty-five minutes duration , commissioned by and dedicated to the flautist susan milan ; cello concerto ( 1991 ) : a one-movement variation-form work of twenty-three minutes duration , commissioned by and dedicated to the cellist raphael wallfisch simpson composed 15 numbered string quartets ; a quartet preceding this sequence was written as part of his course at durham university and still exists there 4–6 are a clearly distinct group related to three beethoven quartets , though they can all be performed as entirely independent compositions in construction and tonality there are elements of an overall symmetry encompassing the three works 1 ( 1951–52 ) : is in two movements , quick and slow ; the second movement is a set of variations on a palindromic theme stated by the viola 2 ( 1953 ) : is the shortest of all simpson 's quartets , playing for about 15 minutes 3 ( 1953–54 ) : is in two movements , slow and quick : an adagio in c major and a pulsing allegro deciso that works round to an affirmative e major ) simpson stated that string quartets nos the three simpson quartets offer , in his own idiom , '' musical analogies '' to the procedures of beethoven 's three quartets , but they can be performed without reference to the beethoven and indeed without reference to each other the four movements & nbsp ; – an allegro , a presto scherzo , an andante sosteunto slow movement joining on without a break to an assai vivace finale & nbsp ; – correspond to the layout of beethoven 's op.59 no.1 7 ( 1977 ) : is dedicated to the organist susi jeans and written in celebration of the birth-centenary of her husband , the astronomer sir james jeans the work is in a single movement and makes much use of the open strings of the instruments , whose tuning simpson likened to the forces of gravity at about 57 minutes ' duration , it is one of the longest continuous movements for string quartet ever written simpson had already composed a set of piano variations on this minuet in 1948 , and three of those variations are transcribed as variations i-iii of the quartet the 32 quartet variations take simpson 's fascination with formal symmetry to a new extreme , though they are grouped to correspond to first movement , scherzo and slow movement 15 ( 1991 ) : is a shorter work in one movement with three contrasting sections , an adagio introduction and an allegretto finale framing a large central scherzo , marked severo most of it was completed in 1991 , before simpson was paralysed with a stroke that left him in permanent pain , but the final coda was dictated to his wife several years later the slow , final coda is one of the darkest endings in all string chamber music literature programme note for british premiere of original 1873 edition of bruckner 's symphony no 3 , royal philharmonic society ( 9 december 1987 ) robert simpson society discography , bibliography and biographical information with a members ' forum article about robert simpson by malcolm macdonald robert simpson interview , 5 january 1991

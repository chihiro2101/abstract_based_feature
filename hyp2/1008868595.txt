there are three main types of contemporary metal handcuffs : chain ( cuffs are held together by a short chain ) , hinged ( since hinged handcuffs permit less movement than a chain cuff , they are generally considered to be more secure ) , and rigid solid bar handcuffs while bulkier to carry , rigid handcuffs permit several variations in cuffing hiatts speedcuffs are rigid handcuffs used by most police forces in the united kingdom is one of the largest suppliers of rigid handcuffs to police forces both rigid and hinged cuffs can be used one-handed to apply pain-compliance/control techniques that are not workable with the chain type of cuff various accessories are available to improve the security or increase the rigidity of handcuffs , including boxes that fit over the chain or hinge and can themselves be locked with a padlock in 1933 the royal canadian mounted police used a type called '' mitten handcuffs '' to prevent criminals from being able to grab an object like the officer 's gun it is not unheard of for a single subject to receive five or more sets of disposable restraints in their first few hours in custody in addition , plastic restraints are believed by many to be more likely to inflict nerve or soft-tissue damage to the wearer than metal handcuffs legcuffs are similar to handcuffs , but have a larger inner perimeter so that they fit around a person 's ankles standard-type leg irons have a longer chain connecting the two cuffs compared to handcuffs the handcuffs are secured to the belly chain and the prisoner 's hands are kept at waist level for added security , some transport restraints have a pair of leg irons connected to a pair of handcuffs or a belly chain by a longer connector chain handcuffs with double locks have a detent which when engaged stops the cuff from ratcheting tighter to prevent the wearer from tightening them double locks are generally disengaged by inserting the key and rotating it in the opposite direction from that used to unlock the cuff the cuff lock handcuff key padlock uses this same standard key to prevent the restrained person from eventually opening the handcuffs with a handcuff key , a handcuff cover may be used to conceal the keyholes of the handcuffs in the past , police officers typically handcuffed an arrested person with their hands in front , but since approximately the mid-1960s behind-the-back handcuffing has been the standard the vast majority of police academies in the united states today also teach their recruits to apply handcuffs so that the palms of the suspect 's hands face outward after the handcuffs are applied this is why escaping from handcuffs is a common stunt performed by magicians or skilled criminals , perhaps most famously harry houdini this is because kazuyoshi miura who had been arrested brought a successful case to court arguing that being pictured in handcuffs implied guilt , and had prejudiced the trial in the 'handcuffs gesture ' the arms are crossed at the wrists in front of the chest , to represent being handcuffed

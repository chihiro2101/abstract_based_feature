in the successful ulster workers council strike in 1974 , which brought down the sunningdale agreement : a power-sharing agreement for northern ireland , which some unionists thought conceded too much to nationalist demands the uda enforced this general strike through widespread intimidation across northern ireland the strike was led by vupp assemblyman and uda member , glenn barr the uda were often referred to by the nickname '' wombles '' by their rivals , mainly the ulster volunteer force ( uvf ) the nickname is derived from the furry fictional children 's tv creatures the wombles , and

that if the provisional irish republican army ( provisional ira ) called off its campaign of violence , then it would do the same however , if the british government announced that it was withdrawing from northern ireland , then the uda would act as '' the ira in reverse 3 they benefited , along with the ulster volunteer force , and a group called ulster resistance ( set up by the democratic unionist party ) , from a shipment of arms imported from lebanon in 1988 although almost two–thirds of these weapons were later recovered by the royal ulster constabulary ( ruc ) , they enabled the uda to launch an assassination campaign against their perceived enemies uda members have since confirmed that they received intelligence files on republicans from british army and ruc intelligence

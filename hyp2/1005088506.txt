involved in the successful ulster workers council strike in 1974 , which brought down the sunningdale agreement : a power-sharing agreement for northern ireland , which some unionists thought conceded too much to nationalist demands the uda enforced this general strike through widespread intimidation across northern ireland the strike was led by vupp assemblyman and uda member , glenn barr the uda were often referred to by the nickname '' wombles '' by their rivals , mainly the ulster volunteer force ( uvf ) the nickname is derived from the furry fictional children 's tv creatures the wombles ,

starting in 1972 the uda along with the other main loyalist paramilitary group the ulster volunteer force , undertook an armed campaign against the catholic population of northern ireland that would last until the end of the troubles in may 1972 , the uda 's pressured leader tommy herron decided that responsibility for acts of violence committed by the uda would be claimed by the '' uff '' 21 the uda 's official position during the troubles was that if the provisional irish republican army ( provisional ira ) called off its campaign of violence , then it would do the same however , if the british government announced that it was withdrawing from northern ireland , then the uda would act as '' the ira in reverse company 's hit squad , led by stephen mckeag , became notorious for a campaign of random murders of catholic civilians in the first half of the 1990s henry mcdonald & jim cusack , uda – inside the heart of loyalist terror , dublin : penguin ireland , 2004 , p 3 they benefited , along with the ulster volunteer force , and a group called ulster resistance ( set up by the democratic unionist party ) , from a shipment of arms imported from lebanon in 1988 in 1992 brian nelson , a prominent uda member convicted of sectarian killings , revealed that he was also a british army agent this led to allegations that the british army and ruc were helping the uda to target irish republican activists uda members have since confirmed that they received intelligence files on republicans from british army and ruc intelligence sources according to the sutton database of deaths at the university of ulster 's cain project , the uda was responsible for 259 killings during the troubles 208 of its victims were civilians ( predominantly catholics ) , 12 were civilian political activists ( mainly members of sinn féin ) , 37 were other loyalist paramilitaries ( including 30 of its own members ) , three were members of the security forces and 11 were republican paramilitaries the police service of northern ireland began accompanying the paper 's delivery vans on 13 november 2005 the uda announced that it would '' consider its future '' , in the wake of the standing down of the provisional ira and loyalist volunteer force on 20 june 2006 , the uda expelled shoukri brothers , two of its senior members who were heavily involved in organised crime the move did see the southeast antrim brigade of the uda , which had been at loggerheads with the leadership for some time , support shoukri and break away under former uprg spokesman tommy kirkham while the report indicated the leadership intends to move towards its stated goals , factionalism hindered this change and was the strongest hindrance to progress although most loyalist actions were curtailed since the imc 's previous report , most of loyalist paramilitary activity was coming from the uda the imc report concluded that the leadership 's willingness to change has resulted in community tension and the group would continue to be monitored , although '' the mainstream uda still has some way to go '' furthermore , the imc warned the group to '' recognise that the organisation 's time as a paramilitary group has passed and that decommissioning is inevitable '' decommissioning was said to be the '' biggest outstanding issue for loyalist leaders , although not the only one '' on 6 january 2010 , the uda announced that it had put its weapons '' verifiably beyond use '' on one occasion the uda sent louis scott , one of a few black members of the uda , to make the transaction the uda is made up of : the inner council the ulster freedom fighters ( uff ) —whose role was to carry out attacks on republican and nationalist targets the ulster political research group ( uprg ) —the uda 's '' political advisory body '' billy mcfarland ( loyalist ) —north antrim and londonderry ( unknown–2013 ) he earned his nickname because of his moustache and swarthy appearance , and had overall command of the uda 's north antrim and londonderry brigade at the time of the belfast agreement

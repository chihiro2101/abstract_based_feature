pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin pepsin is most active in acidic environments between ph 1.5 to 2.5 pepsin is inactive at ph 6.5 and above , however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 8.0 therefore , pepsin in solutions of up to ph 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event pepsin remains in the larynx ( ph 6.8 ) following a gastric reflux event while enzymatically inactive in this environment , pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux under non-acid conditions ( neutral ph ) , pepsin is internalized by cells of the upper airways such as the larynx and hypopharynx by a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis upon cellular uptake , pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low ph at which its enzymatic activity would be restored a rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples 1-bis ( diazoacetyl ) -2-phenylethane reversibly inactivates pepsin at ph 5 , a reaction which is accelerated by the presence of cu ( ii ) pepsin is commonly used in the preparation of f ( ab ' ) 2 fragments from antibodies fab fragments are generated by cleavage of igg with papain instead of pepsin use of f ( ab ' ) 2 or fab fragments ensures that the antibodies are binding to the antigen and not fc receptors

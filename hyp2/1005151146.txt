pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann scientists around this time began discovering many biochemical compounds that play a significant role in biological processes , and pepsin was one of them pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme in the stomach , chief cells release pepsinogen this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining hydrochloric acid creates an acidic environment , which allows pepsinogen to unfold and cleave itself in an autocatalytic fashion , thereby generating pepsin ( the active form ) pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin the optimum temperature of pepsin is between 37 & nbsp ; °c and 42 & nbsp ; °c in humans the concentration of pepsin in the stomach reaches 0.5 – 1 & nbsp ; mg/ml pepsin is inactive at ph 6.5 and above , however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 8.0 pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event generally , hydrophobic amino acids at p1 and p1 ' positions increase cleavage probability pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux upon cellular uptake , pepsin is stored in intracellular vesicles of low ph at which its enzymatic activity would be restored pepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition ; a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin fab fragments are generated by cleavage of igg with papain instead of pepsin

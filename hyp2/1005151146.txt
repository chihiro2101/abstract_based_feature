pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme in the stomach , chief cells release pepsinogen this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin pepsin is most active in acidic environments between ph 1.5 to 2.5 pepsin is inactive at ph 6.5 and above , however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 8.0 therefore , pepsin in solutions of up to ph 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification pepsin will digest up to 20 % of ingested amide bonds generally , hydrophobic amino acids at p1 and p1 ' positions increase cleavage probability pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux pepsin remains in the larynx ( ph 6.8 ) following a gastric reflux event while enzymatically inactive in this environment , pepsin would remain stable and could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux amino acid residues 1 - 3 ( gln-phe-leu ) of mature pi-3 bind to p1 ' - p3 ' positions of pepsin fab fragments are generated by cleavage of igg with papain instead of pepsin

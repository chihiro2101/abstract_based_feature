pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann in 1928 , it became one of the first enzymes to be crystallized when john h pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme in the stomach , chief cells release pepsinogen this zymogen is activated by hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , which is released from parietal cells in the stomach lining pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin in humans the concentration of pepsin in the stomach reaches 0.5 – 1 & nbsp ; mg/ml pepsin is inactive at ph 6.5 and above , however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 8.0 pepsin exhibits a broad cleavage specificity generally , hydrophobic amino acids at p1 and p1 ' positions increase cleavage probability phenylalanine , leucine and methionine at the p1 position , and phenylalanine , tryptophan and tyrosine at the p1 ' position result in the highest cleavage probability cleavage is disfavoured by positively charged amino acids histidine , lysine and arginine at the p1 position pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux pepstatin is a low molecular weight compound and potent inhibitor specific for acid proteases with a ki of about 10 −10 m for pepsin pi-3 occupies the active site of pepsin using its n-terminal residues and thereby blocks substrate binding fab fragments are generated by cleavage of igg with papain instead of pepsin

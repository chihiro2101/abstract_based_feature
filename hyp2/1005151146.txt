pepsin was one of the first enzymes to be discovered in 1836 by theodor schwann pepsin is expressed as a zymogen called pepsinogen , whose primary structure has an additional 44 amino acids compared to the active enzyme pepsin cleaves the 44 amino acids from pepsinogen to create more pepsin pepsin is most active in acidic environments between ph 1.5 to 2.5 pepsin is inactive at ph 6.5 and above , however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until ph 8.0 the stability of pepsin at high ph has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux at the mean ph of the laryngopharynx ( ph 6.8 ) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues generally , hydrophobic amino acids at p1 and p1 ' positions increase cleavage probability pepsin is one of the primary causes of mucosal damage during laryngopharyngeal reflux pepsin remains in the larynx ( ph 6.8 ) following a gastric reflux event pepsin may also cause mucosal damage during weakly acidic or non-acid gastric reflux a rapid non-invasive pepsin diagnostic called peptest is now available which determines the presence of pepsin in saliva samples pepsin may be inhibited by high ph ( see activity and stability ) or by inhibitor compounds pepstatin does not covalently bind pepsin and inhibition of pepsin by pepstatin is therefore reversible amino acid residues 1 - 3 ( gln-phe-leu ) of mature pi-3 bind to p1 ' - p3 ' positions of pepsin pepsin also undergoes feedback inhibition ; a product of protein digestion slows down the reaction by inhibiting pepsin

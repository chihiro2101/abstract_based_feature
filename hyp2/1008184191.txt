there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron in response to this stimulus , the postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine , which activates adrenergic receptors that are present on the peripheral target tissues the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons ; the adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion sympathetic nerves arise from near the middle of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral nucleus of the lateral grey column , beginning at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column and are thought to extend to the second or third lumbar vertebra because its cells begin in the thoracolumbar division â€“ the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow to reach target organs and glands , the axons must travel long distances in the body , and , to accomplish this , many axons relay their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission because paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia are relatively close to the spinal cord , presynaptic neurons are generally much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts , which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia messages travel through the sympathetic nervous system in a bi-directional flow therefore , this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs in heart failure , the sympathetic nervous system increases its activity , leading to increased force of muscular contractions that in turn increases the stroke volume , as well as peripheral vasoconstriction to maintain blood pressure

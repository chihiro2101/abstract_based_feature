there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic from there , the long postganglionic fibers extend across most of the body in response to this stimulus , the postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine , which activates adrenergic receptors that are present on the peripheral target tissues the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons ; the adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion postganglionic sympathetic nerves terminating in the kidney release dopamine , which acts on dopamine d1 receptors of blood vessels to control how much blood the kidney filters because its cells begin in the thoracolumbar division â€“ the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow to reach target organs and glands , the axons must travel long distances in the body , and , to accomplish this , many axons relay their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission because paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia are relatively close to the spinal cord , presynaptic neurons are generally much shorter than their postsynaptic counterparts , which must extend throughout the body to reach their destinations in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia the cell that sends its fiber is called a preganglionic cell , while the cell whose fiber leaves the ganglion is called a postganglionic cell as mentioned previously , the preganglionic cells of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic segment and third lumbar segments of the spinal cord the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for priming the body for action , particularly in situations threatening survival the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs

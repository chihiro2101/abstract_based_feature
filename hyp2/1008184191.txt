there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron at the synapses within the ganglia , preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons in response to this stimulus , the postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine , which activates adrenergic receptors that are present on the peripheral target tissues the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons ; the adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion within this endocrine gland , pre-ganglionic neurons synapse with chromaffin cells , triggering the release of two transmitters : a small proportion of norepinephrine , and more substantially , epinephrine the synthesis and release of epinephrine as opposed to norepinephrine is another distinguishing feature of chromaffin cells compared to postganglionic sympathetic neurons because its cells begin in the thoracolumbar division â€“ the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow in this case , presynaptic neurons pass through paravertebral ganglia , on through prevertebral ganglia and then synapse directly with suprarenal tissue postganglionic cells have their cell bodies in the ganglia and send their axons to target organs or glands the target synapse of the postganglionic neuron is mediated by adrenergic receptors and is activated by either norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) or epinephrine ( adrenaline ) the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs cremaster muscle cremasteric reflex epinephrine history of catecholamine research limbic system norepinephrine sympathetic ganglia sympathetic trunk

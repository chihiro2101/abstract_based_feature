there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron at the synapses within the ganglia , preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons in response to this stimulus , the postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine , which activates adrenergic receptors that are present on the peripheral target tissues the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system however , there are three important exceptions : postganglionic neurons of sweat glands release acetylcholine for the activation of muscarinic receptors , except for areas of thick skin , the palms and the plantar surfaces of the feet , where norepinephrine is released and acts on adrenergic receptors chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons ; the adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion because its cells begin in the thoracolumbar division â€“ the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia postganglionic cells have their cell bodies in the ganglia and send their axons to target organs or glands messages travel through the sympathetic nervous system in a bi-directional flow therefore , this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the sympathetic nervous system and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla the afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system , which transmit sensory information from the internal organs of the body back to the central nervous system ( or cns ) , are not divided into parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers as the efferent fibers are together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs cremaster muscle cremasteric reflex epinephrine history of catecholamine research limbic system norepinephrine sympathetic ganglia sympathetic trunk

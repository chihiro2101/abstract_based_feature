there are two kinds of neurons involved in the transmission of any signal through the sympathetic system : pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic the shorter preganglionic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar division of the spinal cord specifically at t1 to l2~l3 , and travel to a ganglion , often one of the paravertebral ganglia , where they synapse with a postganglionic neuron at the synapses within the ganglia , preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine , a neurotransmitter that activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on postganglionic neurons in response to this stimulus , the postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine , which activates adrenergic receptors that are present on the peripheral target tissues the activation of target tissue receptors causes the effects associated with the sympathetic system chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are analogous to post-ganglionic neurons ; the adrenal medulla develops in tandem with the sympathetic nervous system and acts as a modified sympathetic ganglion the synthesis and release of epinephrine as opposed to norepinephrine is another distinguishing feature of chromaffin cells compared to postganglionic sympathetic neurons because its cells begin in the thoracolumbar division â€“ the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord - the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow to reach target organs and glands , the axons must travel long distances in the body , and , to accomplish this , many axons relay their message to a second cell through synaptic transmission the first cell ( the presynaptic cell ) sends a neurotransmitter across the synaptic cleft where it activates the second cell ( the postsynaptic cell ) in the sympathetic nervous system and other components of the peripheral nervous system , these synapses are made at sites called ganglia as mentioned previously , the preganglionic cells of the sympathetic nervous system are located between the first thoracic segment and third lumbar segments of the spinal cord sympathetic nervous system stimulation causes vasoconstriction of most blood vessels , including many of those in the skin , the digestive tract , and the kidneys together with the other component of the autonomic nervous system , the parasympathetic nervous system , the sympathetic nervous system aids in the control of most of the body 's internal organs cremaster muscle cremasteric reflex epinephrine history of catecholamine research limbic system norepinephrine sympathetic ganglia sympathetic trunk

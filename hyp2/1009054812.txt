there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled dusenbery , david b , enzymes ) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent '' soup '' in others , once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism , digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure , through a tube , or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient image : conjugation.svg right thumb 250px schematic drawing of bacterial conjugation 3- the mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of dna is transferred to the recipient cell in a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( mfp ) , and outer membrane protein ( omp ) it was discovered in agrobacterium tumefaciens , which uses this system to introduce the ti plasmid and proteins into the host , which develops the crown gall ( tumor ) such elements as the agrobacterium ti or ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells release of outer membrane vesicles in addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above , gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material : the formation of outer membrane vesicles the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity , which is lined with the gastrodermis , the internal layer of epithelium image : trophozoites of entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes.jpg thumb 125px left trophozoites of entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes a phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis to aid in the digestion of their food , animals evolved organs such as beaks , tongues , radulae , teeth , crops , gizzards , and others birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird 's ecological niche for example , macaws primarily eat seeds , nuts , and fruit , using their beaks to open even the toughest seed first they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak , then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak the mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins the beak is very robust , but does not contain any minerals , unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms , including marine species the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) the tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing the sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin , and underlain by a plexus of veins carnivores have canine tooth which are used to kill and tear meat a crop , or croup , is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion in adult doves and pigeons , the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds it serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop , referring to crop milk , a secretion from the lining of the crop of columbidae with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation capybara , rabbits , hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do , for example , ruminants young elephants , pandas , koalas , and hippos eat the faeces of their mother , probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation without them , they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components an earthworm 's digestive system consists of a mouth , pharynx , esophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine the stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes it is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in ph secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach gastric inhibitory peptide ( gip ) – is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach human physiology – digestion nih guide to digestive system the digestive

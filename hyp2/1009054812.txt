digestive systems take many forms external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled , enzymes ) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent '' soup '' in others , once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism , digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure , through a tube , or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient 2- pilus attaches to recipient cell , bringing the two cells together 4- both cells recircularize their plasmids , synthesize second strands , and reproduce pili ; both cells are now viable donors in a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( mfp ) , and outer membrane protein ( omp ) this secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20–900 kda ) a type iii secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium ( e.g the conjugation machinery of some bacteria ( and archaeal flagella ) is capable of transporting both dna and proteins it was discovered in agrobacterium tumefaciens , which uses this system to introduce the ti plasmid and proteins into the host , which develops the crown gall ( tumor ) the diazotroph rhizobia are an interesting case , wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines , which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources while release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions , the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective image : trophozoites of entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes.jpg thumb 125px left trophozoites of entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes to aid in the digestion of their food , animals evolved organs such as beaks , tongues , radulae , teeth , crops , gizzards , and others for example , macaws primarily eat seeds , nuts , and fruit , using their beaks to open even the toughest seed the beak is very robust , but does not contain any minerals , unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms , including marine species the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) the tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing the tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis this is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body the sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity , and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system , bypassing the gastrointestinal tract teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food teeth are not made of bone , but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness , such as enamel , dentine and cementum for example , herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter , which is difficult to digest in adult doves and pigeons , the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus in the first two chambers , the rumen and the reticulum , the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material in the omasum , water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream digesta is finally moved into the small intestine , where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop , referring to crop milk , a secretion from the lining of the crop of columbidae with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation capybara , rabbits , hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do , for example , ruminants soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately the major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection cholecystokinin ( cck ) – is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder gastric inhibitory peptide ( gip ) – is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach in the small intestines , the duodenum provides critical ph balancing to activate digestive enzymes

there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it “ life at small scale ” , pp in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled some organisms , including nearly all spiders , simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals ( e.g 4- both cells recircularize their plasmids , synthesize second strands , and reproduce pili ; both cells are now viable donors bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( mfp ) , and outer membrane protein ( omp ) , washington , dc : asm press the conjugation machinery of some bacteria ( and archaeal flagella ) is capable of transporting both dna and proteins the virb complex of agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system such elements as the agrobacterium ti or ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells in addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above , gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material : the formation of outer membrane vesicles portions of the outer membrane pinch off , forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity , which is lined with the gastrodermis , the internal layer of epithelium this cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus : waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus , which can be described as an incomplete gut a phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis a phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process , forming phagolysosomes to aid in the digestion of their food , animals evolved organs such as beaks , tongues , radulae , teeth , crops , gizzards , and others first they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak , then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak it is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) it is sensitive and kept moist by saliva the tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food teeth are not made of bone , but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness , such as enamel , dentine and cementum human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception the shapes , sizes and numbers of types of animals ' teeth are related to their diets certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus herbivores have evolved cecums ( or an abomasum in the case of ruminants ) microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine other animals , such as rabbits and rodents , practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food , especially in the case of roughage instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately in most vertebrates , digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system , starting from ingestion of raw materials , most often other organisms food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal , and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours it is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in ph in the small intestines , the duodenum provides critical ph balancing to activate digestive enzymes human physiology – digestion nih guide to digestive system the digestive system how does the digestive system work ?

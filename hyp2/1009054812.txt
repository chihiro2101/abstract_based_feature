external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled some organisms , including nearly all spiders , simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals ( e.g 2- pilus attaches to recipient cell , bringing the two cells together 3- the mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of dna is transferred to the recipient cell 4- both cells recircularize their plasmids , synthesize second strands , and reproduce pili ; both cells are now viable donors bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments in a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria this secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20–900 kda ) the molecules secreted vary in size from the small escherichia coli peptide colicin v , ( 10 kda ) to the pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein lapa of 900 kda a type iii secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium ( e.g certain types of salmonella , shigella , yersinia ) can inject nutrients into protist cells pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host 's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium the conjugation machinery of some bacteria ( and archaeal flagella ) is capable of transporting both dna and proteins it was discovered in agrobacterium tumefaciens , which uses this system to introduce the ti plasmid and proteins into the host , which develops the crown gall ( tumor ) the diazotroph rhizobia are an interesting case , wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation such elements as the agrobacterium ti or ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines , which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity , which is lined with the gastrodermis , the internal layer of epithelium this cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus : waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus , which can be described as an incomplete gut a phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis in humans , entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird 's ecological niche it is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) the tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis this is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food a crop , or croup , is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion the cud is then regurgitated , chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size it is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach ( e.g it serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine digesta is finally moved into the small intestine , where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine in mammals , preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal , and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours it is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in ph sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine human physiology – digestion nih guide to digestive system the digestive system how does the digestive system work ?

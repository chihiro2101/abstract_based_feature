digestive systems take many forms there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion “ life at small scale ” , pp animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled , enzymes ) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent '' soup '' 3- the mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of dna is transferred to the recipient cell bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments this secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20–900 kda ) the molecules secreted vary in size from the small escherichia coli peptide colicin v , ( 10 kda ) to the pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein lapa of 900 kda the conjugation machinery of some bacteria ( and archaeal flagella ) is capable of transporting both dna and proteins the virb complex of agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system the diazotroph rhizobia are an interesting case , wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation such elements as the agrobacterium ti or ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors ti and ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system ( the tra , or transfer , operon ) from that for inter-kingdom transfer ( the vir , or virulence , operon ) such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent agrobacteria portions of the outer membrane pinch off , forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors , some have immunomodulatory effects , and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells while release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions , the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body image : trophozoites of entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes.jpg thumb 125px left trophozoites of entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes a phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis to aid in the digestion of their food , animals evolved organs such as beaks , tongues , radulae , teeth , crops , gizzards , and others the beak is very robust , but does not contain any minerals , unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms , including marine species the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) the tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing the sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin , and underlain by a plexus of veins the sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity , and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system , bypassing the gastrointestinal tract teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food a crop , or croup , is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion digesta is finally moved into the small intestine , where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs other animals , such as rabbits and rodents , practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food , especially in the case of roughage capybara , rabbits , hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do , for example , ruminants soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately an earthworm 's digestive system consists of a mouth , pharynx , esophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine the esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay this releases carbohydrates , protein , fat , and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis during digestion , bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase , resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides in the small intestines , the duodenum provides critical ph balancing to activate digestive enzymes

there is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion external digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it in this process , enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism , where they break down an organic material , and some of the products diffuse back to the organism animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled some organisms , including nearly all spiders , simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals ( e.g in others , once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism , digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure , through a tube , or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient image : conjugation.svg right thumb 250px schematic drawing of bacterial conjugation 4- both cells recircularize their plasmids , synthesize second strands , and reproduce pili ; both cells are now viable donors in a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( mfp ) , and outer membrane protein ( omp ) this secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20–900 kda ) the molecules secreted vary in size from the small escherichia coli peptide colicin v , ( 10 kda ) to the pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein lapa of 900 kda a type iii secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium ( e.g portions of the outer membrane pinch off , forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials while release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions , the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity , which is lined with the gastrodermis , the internal layer of epithelium in humans , entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells to aid in the digestion of their food , animals evolved organs such as beaks , tongues , radulae , teeth , crops , gizzards , and others first they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak , then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak the tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates , that manipulates food for chewing ( mastication ) and swallowing ( deglutition ) the sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity , and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system , bypassing the gastrointestinal tract human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception this is the ability of sensation when chewing , for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth , such as a chipped plate mixed in food , our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it can not be chewed , so we stop trying for example , herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter , which is difficult to digest a crop , or croup , is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion in adult doves and pigeons , the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds the abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants it serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine other animals , such as rabbits and rodents , practise coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food , especially in the case of roughage capybara , rabbits , hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do , for example , ruminants the esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay the major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine the large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion in mammals , preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach the stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection the partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme during digestion , bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase , resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose after the b 12 -haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum , pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the b 12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor ( if ) gastric inhibitory peptide ( gip ) – is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach human physiology – digestion nih guide to digestive system the digestive system how does the digestive system work ?

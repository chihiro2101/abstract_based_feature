the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio for audio broadcasts to be possible , electronic detection and amplification devices had to be incorporated later known as the fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker the triode ( mercury-vapor filled with a control grid ) was created on march 4 , 1906 , by the austrian robert von lieben drp 179807 tapan k by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable however , an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on christmas eve in 1906 by reginald fessenden , although this is disputed in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station in 1916 , frank conrad , an electrical engineer employed at the westinghouse electric ( 1886 ) , began broadcasting from his wilkinsburg , pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8xk westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states the first licensed broadcast in the united states came from kdka itself : the results of the u.s she was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts the 2mt station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922 radio argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the teatro coliseo in buenos aires on august 27 , 1920 , making its own priority claim this station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment and cultural fare for several decades '' early history of radio broadcasting in argentina radio in education soon followed and colleges across the u.s began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula the point of this is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology can receive the broadcast in line to itu radio regulations ( article1.61 ) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using am technology that can be received over thousands of miles ( especially at night ) thumb am stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted europe also uses the long wave band based on the '' interference '' entry of the concise oxford english dictionary , 11th edition , online one advantage of am radio signal is that it can be detected ( turned into sound ) with simple equipment if a signal is strong enough , not even a power source is needed ; building an unpowered crystal radio was a common childhood project in the early decades of am broadcasting some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in north america ; these are called clear-channel stations at the time that am broadcasting began in the 1920s , this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones , 78 rpm recordings , and loudspeakers am stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area bob carver had left the company and the carver corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely shortwave is used largely for national broadcasters , international propaganda , or religious broadcasting organizations at the same time , greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum at the time fm was set up , the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for am radio - by a factor of approximately 100 pirate radio stations are sometimes referred to as bootleg radio or clandestine stations extensions of traditional radio-wave broadcasting for audio broadcasting in general include cable radio , local wire television networks , dtv radio , satellite radio , and internet radio via streaming media on the internet as technology for sound recording improved , an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material '' empire of the air : the men who made radio '' ( 1992 ) by ken burns was a pbs documentary based on the book the american radio industry and its latin american activities , 1900-1939 ( university of illinois press , 1990 )

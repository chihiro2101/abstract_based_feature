the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio he developed a device he called an '' oscillation valve '' ( because it passes current in only one direction ) the heated filament , or cathode , was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate ( or anode ) when it was at a higher voltage later known as the fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable however , an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on christmas eve in 1906 by reginald fessenden , although this is disputed charles herrold started broadcasting in california in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station later , the station was moved to the top of the westinghouse factory building in east pittsburgh , pennsylvania westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 '' early history of radio broadcasting in argentina radio in education soon followed and colleges across the u.s began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves the point of this is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology can receive the broadcast in line to itu radio regulations ( article1.61 ) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms for example , the bbc , voa , vor , and deutsche welle have transmitted via shortwave to africa and asia thumb am stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed europe also uses the long wave band in response to the growing popularity of fm stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s , some north american stations began broadcasting in am stereo , though this never gained popularity , and very few receivers were ever sold based on the '' interference '' entry of the concise oxford english dictionary , 11th edition , online one advantage of am radio signal is that it can be detected ( turned into sound ) with simple equipment if a signal is strong enough , not even a power source is needed ; building an unpowered crystal radio was a common childhood project in the early decades of am broadcasting some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in north america ; these are called clear-channel stations bob carver had left the company and the carver corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely see shortwave for the differences between shortwave , medium wave , and long wave spectra image:2006fm broadcast stations.png thumb right 260px fm radio broadcast stations in 2006 fm refers to frequency modulation , and occurs on vhf airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 mhz everywhere except japan and russia edwin howard armstrong invented fm radio to overcome the problem of electromagnetic interference ( rfi ) , which plagued am radio reception at the same time , greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum instead of 10 & nbsp ; khz apart , as on the am band in the us , fm channels are 200 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.2 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart at the time fm was set up , the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for am radio - by a factor of approximately 100 pirate radio is illegal or non-regulated radio transmission hd radio is owned by a consortium of private companies that is called ibiquity currently , the us operates similar services aimed at cuba ( radio y televisión martí ) and the people 's republic of china , vietnam , laos and north korea ( radio free asia ) in the us and canada , just two services , xm satellite radio and sirius satellite radio exist le marché de la radio au québec : document de reference the american radio industry and its latin american activities , 1900-1939 ( university of illinois press , 1990 )

the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio for audio broadcasts to be possible , electronic detection and amplification devices had to be incorporated the thermionic valve ( a kind of vacuum tube ) was invented in 1904 by the english physicist john ambrose fleming he developed a device he called an '' oscillation valve '' ( because it passes current in only one direction ) the heated filament , or cathode , was capable of thermionic emission of electrons that would flow to the plate ( or anode ) when it was at a higher voltage electrons , however , could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons later known as the fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable however , an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on christmas eve in 1906 by reginald fessenden , although this is disputed in 1916 , frank conrad , an electrical engineer employed at the westinghouse electric ( 1886 ) , began broadcasting from his wilkinsburg , pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8xk later , the station was moved to the top of the westinghouse factory building in east pittsburgh , pennsylvania westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states the commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license ; advertisings did not air until years later in 1920 , wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the uk from the marconi research centre 2mt at writtle near chelmsford , england the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 '' early history of radio broadcasting in argentina radio in education soon followed and colleges across the u.s curry college in milton , massachusetts introduced one of the first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with wloe in boston to have students broadcast programs a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms for example , the bbc , voa , vor , and deutsche welle have transmitted via shortwave to africa and asia thumb am stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) channels are spaced every 10 & nbsp ; khz in the americas , and generally every 9 & nbsp ; khz everywhere else the fidelity of sound equipment subsequently improved considerably , but the receivers did not am stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area this prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other bob carver had left the company and the carver corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely see shortwave for the differences between shortwave , medium wave , and long wave spectra russia , like the former soviet union , uses 65.9 to 74 & nbsp ; mhz frequencies in addition to the world standard at the same time , greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum instead of 10 & nbsp ; khz apart , as on the am band in the us , fm channels are 200 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.2 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power , the range of a given fm signal was much shorter ; thus its market was more local than for am radio the original fm radio service in the u.s pirate radio stations are sometimes referred to as bootleg radio or clandestine stations in the us and canada , just two services , xm satellite radio and sirius satellite radio exist early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time , known as live broadcasting

the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio the thermionic valve ( a kind of vacuum tube ) was invented in 1904 by the english physicist john ambrose fleming he developed a device he called an '' oscillation valve '' ( because it passes current in only one direction ) later known as the fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker , p.335 sōgo okamura ( ed ) , history of electron tubes , ios press , 1994 page 20 independent from that , on october 25 , 1906 , lee de forest patented his three-element audion by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states she was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 radio argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the teatro coliseo in buenos aires on august 27 , 1920 , making its own priority claim radio in education soon followed and colleges across the u.s began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms there are several subtypes , namely commercial broadcasting , non-commercial educational ( nce ) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio , student-run campus radio stations , and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using am technology that can be received over thousands of miles ( especially at night ) for example , the bbc , voa , vor , and deutsche welle have transmitted via shortwave to africa and asia am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted in response to the growing popularity of fm stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s , some north american stations began broadcasting in am stereo , though this never gained popularity , and very few receivers were ever sold if a signal is strong enough , not even a power source is needed ; building an unpowered crystal radio was a common childhood project in the early decades of am broadcasting am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in north america ; these are called clear-channel stations during the night , absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via ionospheric reflections at the time that am broadcasting began in the 1920s , this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones , 78 rpm recordings , and loudspeakers am stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area this prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other bob carver created an am stereo tuner employing notch filtering that demonstrated that an am broadcast can meet or exceed the 15 & nbsp ; khz baseband bandwidth allotted to fm stations without objectionable interference instead of 10 & nbsp ; khz apart , as on the am band in the us , fm channels are 200 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.2 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart in other countries , greater spacing is sometimes mandatory , such as in new zealand , which uses 700 & nbsp ; khz spacing ( previously 800 & nbsp ; khz ) bandwidth of 200 khz is not needed to accommodate an audio signal & mdash ; 20 & nbsp ; khz to 30 & nbsp ; khz is all that is necessary for a narrowband fm signal the 200 & nbsp ; khz bandwidth allowed room for ±75 & nbsp ; khz signal deviation from the assigned frequency , plus guard bands to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference the larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15 & nbsp ; khz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38 & nbsp ; khz stereo '' subcarrier '' —a piggyback signal that rides on the main signal regular fm broadcasting began in 1939 but did not pose a significant threat to the am broadcasting industry rules and regulations vary largely from country to country , but often the term pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of fm radio , am radio , or shortwave signals over a wide range an international non-profit consortium digital radio mondiale ( drm ) , has introduced the public domain drm system , which is used by a relatively small number of broadcasters worldwide early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time , known as live broadcasting points on the dial : golden age radio beyond the networks ( duke university press ; 2010 ) 278 pages ; discusses regional and local radio as forms that '' complicate '' the image of the medium as a national unifier from the 1920s to the 1950s

the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio electrons , however , could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons later known as the fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker the triode ( mercury-vapor filled with a control grid ) was created on march 4 , 1906 , by the austrian robert von lieben drp 179807 tapan k by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable however , an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on christmas eve in 1906 by reginald fessenden , although this is disputed charles herrold started broadcasting in california in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states the commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license ; advertisings did not air until years later the montreal station that became cfcf began broadcast programming on may 20 , 1920 , and the detroit station that became wwj began program broadcasts beginning on august 20 , 1920 , although neither held a license at the time in 1920 , wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the uk from the marconi research centre 2mt at writtle near chelmsford , england a famous broadcast from marconi 's new street works factory in chelmsford was made by the famous soprano dame nellie melba on june 15 , 1920 , where she sang two arias and her famous trill she was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts the 2mt station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922 the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 radio argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the teatro coliseo in buenos aires on august 27 , 1920 , making its own priority claim '' early history of radio broadcasting in argentina a radio broadcasting station is usually associated with wireless transmission , though in practice broadcasting transmission ( sound and television ) take place using both wires and radio waves in line to itu radio regulations ( article1.61 ) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily thumb broadcasting by radio takes several forms many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using am technology that can be received over thousands of miles ( especially at night ) am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted in response to the growing popularity of fm stereo radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s , some north american stations began broadcasting in am stereo , though this never gained popularity , and very few receivers were ever sold am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) in a crowded channel environment , this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference , which reduces the potential nighttime audience at the time that am broadcasting began in the 1920s , this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones , 78 rpm recordings , and loudspeakers bob carver had left the company and the carver corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely edwin howard armstrong invented fm radio to overcome the problem of electromagnetic interference ( rfi ) , which plagued am radio reception bandwidth of 200 khz is not needed to accommodate an audio signal & mdash ; 20 & nbsp ; khz to 30 & nbsp ; khz is all that is necessary for a narrowband fm signal the larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15 & nbsp ; khz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38 & nbsp ; khz stereo '' subcarrier '' —a piggyback signal that rides on the main signal the am radio problem of interference at night was addressed in a different way using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power , the range of a given fm signal was much shorter ; thus its market was more local than for am radio in some places , radio stations are legal where the signal is transmitted , but illegal where the signals are received—especially when the signals cross a national boundary during the cold war the american radio free europe and radio liberty and indian radio air were founded to broadcast news from '' behind the iron curtain '' that was otherwise being censored and promote dissent and occasionally , to disseminate disinformation another station , such as hcjb or trans world radio will carry brokered programming from evangelists broadcasting construction permit call sign disc jockey ( dj ) history of broadcasting international broadcasting list of radio topics low power radio station radio radio antenna radio network radio personality rf modulation sports commentator television station broadcasting : radio and television ( harper & brothers , 1952 )

the earliest radio stations were radiotelegraphy systems and did not carry audio he developed a device he called an '' oscillation valve '' ( because it passes current in only one direction ) later known as the fleming valve , it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector this greatly improved the crystal set which rectified the radio signal using an early solid-state diode based on a crystal and a so-called cat 's whisker by about 1920 , valve technology had matured to the point where radio broadcasting was quickly becoming viable however , an early audio transmission that could be termed a broadcast may have occurred on christmas eve in 1906 by reginald fessenden , although this is disputed in the hague , the netherlands , pcgg started broadcasting on november 6 , 1919 , making it , arguably the first commercial broadcasting station in 1916 , frank conrad , an electrical engineer employed at the westinghouse electric ( 1886 ) , began broadcasting from his wilkinsburg , pennsylvania garage with the call letters 8xk later , the station was moved to the top of the westinghouse factory building in east pittsburgh , pennsylvania westinghouse relaunched the station as kdka on november 2 , 1920 , as the first commercially licensed radio station in the united states the commercial broadcasting designation came from the type of broadcast license ; advertisings did not air until years later the first licensed broadcast in the united states came from kdka itself : the results of the u.s the montreal station that became cfcf began broadcast programming on may 20 , 1920 , and the detroit station that became wwj began program broadcasts beginning on august 20 , 1920 , although neither held a license at the time in 1920 , wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the uk from the marconi research centre 2mt at writtle near chelmsford , england the 2mt station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922 the bbc was amalgamated in 1922 and received a royal charter in 1926 , making it the first national broadcaster in the world , followed by czech radio and other european broadcasters in 1923 radio argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the teatro coliseo in buenos aires on august 27 , 1920 , making its own priority claim '' early history of radio broadcasting in argentina in line to itu radio regulations ( article1.61 ) each broadcasting station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily there are several subtypes , namely commercial broadcasting , non-commercial educational ( nce ) public broadcasting and non-profit varieties as well as community radio , student-run campus radio stations , and hospital radio stations can be found throughout the world many stations broadcast on shortwave bands using am technology that can be received over thousands of miles ( especially at night ) am refers to amplitude modulation , a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted based on the '' interference '' entry of the concise oxford english dictionary , 11th edition , online one advantage of am radio signal is that it can be detected ( turned into sound ) with simple equipment am broadcasts occur on north american airwaves in the medium wave frequency range of 525 to 1705 khz ( known as the “ standard broadcast band ” ) some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in north america ; these are called clear-channel stations reducing the bandwidth of the receivers reduces the cost of manufacturing and makes them less prone to interference see shortwave for the differences between shortwave , medium wave , and long wave spectra russia , like the former soviet union , uses 65.9 to 74 & nbsp ; mhz frequencies in addition to the world standard at the same time , greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the radio frequency spectrum instead of 10 & nbsp ; khz apart , as on the am band in the us , fm channels are 200 & nbsp ; khz ( 0.2 & nbsp ; mhz ) apart in other countries , greater spacing is sometimes mandatory , such as in new zealand , which uses 700 & nbsp ; khz spacing ( previously 800 & nbsp ; khz ) the improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s , but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband fm bandwidth of 200 khz is not needed to accommodate an audio signal & mdash ; 20 & nbsp ; khz to 30 & nbsp ; khz is all that is necessary for a narrowband fm signal germany and the netherlands use the dab and dab+ systems , and france uses the l-band system of dab digital radio the enormous entry costs of space-based satellite transmitters and restrictions on available radio spectrum licenses has restricted growth of satellite radio broadcasts lewis , tom , empire of the air : the men who made radio , 1st ed : comprises : robert pilon 's and isabelle lamoureux ' profil du marché de radio au québec : un analyse de média-culture points on the dial : golden age radio beyond the networks ( duke university press ;

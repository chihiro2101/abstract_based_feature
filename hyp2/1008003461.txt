the book is named after the book of jasher mentioned in joshua and 2 samuel joseph jacobs schulim ochser 1911 jewish encyclopedia article although it is presented as the original '' book of jasher '' in translations such as that of moses samuel ( 1840 ) , it is not accepted as such in rabbinical judaism , nor does the original hebrew text make such a claim it should not be confused with the very different book of jasher ( pseudo-jasher ) printed by jacob ilive in 1751 , which was purported to have been translated by the english monk alcuin the book covers biblical history from the creation of adam and eve until a summary of the initial israelite conquest of canaan in the beginning of the book of judges the bible twice quotes from a sefer hayashar , and this midrashic work includes text that fits both biblical references - the reference about the sun and moon found in joshua , and also the reference in 2 samuel ( in the hebrew but not in the septuagint ) to teaching the sons of judah to fight with the bow ( mcr ) but the book as a whole was written much later - as shown by chapter 10 , covering the descendants of noah , but containing medieval names for territories and countries , most obviously franza for france and lumbardi in italy for lombardy the text of this chapter closely follows the beginning of josippon , a tenth-century rabbinic text that lists the various peoples living in europe in ca most of its extra-biblical accounts are found in nearly the same form in other medieval compilations , or in the talmud , other midrash or arabic sources there are five discrepancies when comparing it with chapter 5 of genesis : when the sefer relates that a son of seth died '' in the eighty-fourth year of the life of noah '' , it calls that son enoch instead of enosh in its genealogy of abram ( 7:19 ) , it makes no mention of the cainan between arpachsad and shelah , in congruence with the masoretic text and samaritan pentateuch , but in conflict with the septuagint ( lxx ) and luke 's genealogy in chapter 3 of his gospel abraham ibn ezra 's commentary on numbers 12:1 ( hebrew ) , where he wrote : '' …and there are those who say that moses reigned over kush and took a negro wife , etc the earliest extant version of this hebrew midrash was printed in venice in 1625 , and the introduction refers to an earlier 1552 edition in naples , of which neither trace nor other mention has been found the printer yosèf ben samuel claimed the work was copied by a scribe named jacob the son of atyah , from an ancient manuscript whose letters could hardly be made out modena was a member of the venetian rabbinate that supervised the hebrew press in venice , and modena prevented the printers from identifying sefer ha-yashar with the biblical lost book - page 68 yaacob dweck - 2011 '' modena compared the pseudepigraphic character of the zohar to sefer ha-yashar , a hebrew work printed in venice in the early seventeenth century some of these scholars suggest that the book likely contains many original portions of the sefer hayashar referenced in the old testament but also has a number of added interpolations hebrew editions sefer ha-yashar , ed dan joseph , jerusalem , 1986 english translation : book of yasher ( 1750 ) , by thomas ilive book of jasher referred to in joshua and second samuel ( 1840 ) , by moses samuel book of jasher referred to in joshua and second samuel ( 1887 ) , edited by j

on twin earth , there is a twin equivalent of every person and thing here on earth the one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on twin earth finally , we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago , when the residents of earth and twin earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called '' water '' were h 2 o and xyz respectively now the question arises : when an earthling ( or oscar for simplicity 's sake ) and his twin on twin earth say 'water ' do they mean the same thing ? ( the twin is also called 'oscar ' on his own planet , of course ( oscar , for instance , learned the word 'water ' in a world filled with h 2 o , whereas twin oscar learned 'water ' in a world filled with xyz tyler burge subsequently argued in '' other bodies '' ( 1982 ) that the twins ' mental states are different : oscar has the concept h 2 o , while twin oscar has the concept xyz putnam has since expressed agreement with burge 's interpretation of the thought experiment ) a number of philosophers have argued that '' water '' for both oscar and twin oscar refers to anything that is sufficiently water-like ( i.e searle , along with others , considers this sufficient argument to '' solve '' the thought experiment altogether ; others , such as donald davidson , feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions john mcdowell , in his paper '' putnam on mind and meaning '' , see john mcdowell ( 1998 ) : '' putnam on mind and meaning ''

putnam 's original formulation of the experiment was this : we begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like earth in virtually all aspects , which we refer to as '' twin earth '' on twin earth , there is a twin equivalent of every person and thing here on earth the one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on twin earth finally , we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago , when the residents of earth and twin earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called '' water '' were h 2 o and xyz respectively the experience of people on earth with water and that of those on twin earth with xyz would be identical now the question arises : when an earthling ( or oscar for simplicity 's sake ) and his twin on twin earth say 'water ' do they mean the same thing ? ( the twin is also called 'oscar ' on his own planet , of course putnam has since expressed agreement with burge 's interpretation of the thought experiment although this type of argument does not directly disprove externalism , it is pressing because of the intuitive plausibility of privileged self-knowledge 's existence john mcdowell , in his paper '' putnam on mind and meaning '' , see john mcdowell ( 1998 ) : '' putnam on mind and meaning '' swampman internalism and externalism externalism semantic externalism philosophy of language

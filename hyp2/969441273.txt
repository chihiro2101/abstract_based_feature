putnam 's original formulation of the experiment was this : we begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like earth in virtually all aspects , which we refer to as '' twin earth '' on twin earth , there is a twin equivalent of every person and thing here on earth the one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on twin earth finally , we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago , when the residents of earth and twin earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called '' water '' were h 2 o and xyz respectively now the question arises : when an earthling ( or oscar for simplicity 's sake ) and his twin on twin earth say 'water ' do they mean the same thing ? ( the twin is also called 'oscar ' on his own planet , of course yet , at least according to putnam , when oscar says 'water ' , the term refers to h 2 o , whereas when twin oscar says 'water ' it refers to xyz ( oscar , for instance , learned the word 'water ' in a world filled with h 2 o , whereas twin oscar learned 'water ' in a world filled with xyz in his original article , putnam had claimed that the reference of the twins ' '' water '' varied even though their psychological states were the same putnam has since expressed agreement with burge 's interpretation of the thought experiment has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds , which many have taken to be established and/or supported by putnam 's twin earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification

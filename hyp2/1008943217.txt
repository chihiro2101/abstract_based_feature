'' both papers exaggerated and distorted any information they could obtain , sometimes even fabricating news when none that fitted their agenda was available its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to havana , including frederic remington , and hearst announced a reward of 50,000 '' for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 american sailors to their deaths privately , pulitzer believed that '' nobody outside a lunatic asylum '' really believed that spain sanctioned maines destruction the american public , already agitated over reported spanish atrocities in cuba , was driven to increased hysteria he frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident in the first place , such a thing has never occurred before that i have ever heard of either in the british navy or ours the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo the episode focused national attention on the crisis in cuba advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking in addition to the inquiry commissioned by the spanish government to naval officers del peral and de salas , two naval courts of inquiry were ordered : the sampson board in 1898 and the vreeland board in 1911 rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion , and the national geographic society did an investigation in 1999 , using computer simulations all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded the spanish inquiry , conducted by del peral and de salas , collected evidence from officers of naval artillery , who had examined the remains of the maine del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion additional observations included that : had a mine been the cause of the explosion , a column of water would have been observed the wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact , but only by using electricity , but no cables had been found no dead fish were found in the harbor , as would be expected following an explosion in the water munition stores do not usually explode when a ship is sunk by a mine in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t captain sigsbee had written that '' many spanish officers , including representatives of general blanco , now with us to express sympathy '' in a cable , the spanish minister of colonies , segismundo moret , had advised blanco '' to gather every fact you can , to prove the maine catastrophe can not be attributed to us rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking , the secretary of the navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally '' eventually , navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board , captain sampson being senior to captain sigsbee captain sampson read commander converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition , with a resulting explosion sinking the ship the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines the official report from the board , which was presented to the navy department in washington on 21 march , specifically stated the following : wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the threat of war , which had been the case in 1898 , lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously moreover , since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers , they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been they concluded that an external explosion had triggered the explosion of the magazines this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the sampson board he concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine , and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause , from coal in the bunker next to the magazine navy and the spanish–american war , wegner revisits the rickover investigation and offers additional details wegner says that all relevant documents were obtained and studied , including the ship 's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of maine in 1912 ( the progress of the cofferdam ) written by william furgueson , chief engineer for the project wegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the rickover study up to the time of the maines building , he explains , common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers , and american naval ships burned smokeless anthracite coal with an increase in the number of steel ships , the navy switched to bituminous coal , which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal and allowed ships to steam faster pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally experienced spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine the pyrites could have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire could have taken place and ignited the ship 's ammunition due to the 1912 raising of the ship , the wreck was completely missing its bow ;

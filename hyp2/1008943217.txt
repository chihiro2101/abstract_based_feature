the new york journal and new york world , owned respectively by william randolph hearst and joseph pulitzer , gave maine intense press coverage , employing tactics that would later be labeled '' yellow journalism nevertheless , this did not stop the world from insisting that the only '' atonement '' spain could offer the u.s for the loss of ship and life , was the granting of complete cuban independence the american public , already agitated over reported spanish atrocities in cuba , was driven to increased hysteria william randolph hearst 's reporting on maine whipped up support for military action against the spanish in cuba regardless of their actual involvement in the sinking he frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident in the first place , such a thing has never occurred before that i have ever heard of either in the british navy or ours '' hearst 's sources never had to be specifically named because he just needed them to support the narrative that the explosion was caused by an attack by the spanish maines destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with spain , but the event created an atmosphere that precluded a peaceful solution the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking in addition to the inquiry commissioned by the spanish government to naval officers del peral and de salas , two naval courts of inquiry were ordered : the sampson board in 1898 and the vreeland board in 1911 rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion , and the national geographic society did an investigation in 1999 , using computer simulations all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion additional observations included that : had a mine been the cause of the explosion , a column of water would have been observed the wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact , but only by using electricity , but no cables had been found no dead fish were found in the harbor , as would be expected following an explosion in the water hugh thomas , memoria del 98 ( 1997 edition ) , chapter 7 ( '' la explosión del maine '' ) , p 1898 sampson board 's court of inquiry in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t ramón blanco y erenas , spanish governor of cuba , had proposed instead a joint spanish-american investigation of the sinking '' in a cable , the spanish minister of colonies , segismundo moret , had advised blanco '' to gather every fact you can , to prove the maine catastrophe can not be attributed to us rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking , the secretary of the navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally instead , he fell back on protocol and assigned the commander-in-chief of the north atlantic squadron to do so '' eventually , navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board , captain sampson being senior to captain sigsbee '' another inconsistency , according to wegner , was that of only one technical witness , commander george converse , from the torpedo station at newport , rhode island the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines besides the desire for a more thorough investigation , this would also facilitate the recovery of the bodies of the victims , so they could be buried in the united states moreover , since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers , they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the sampson board the vreeland board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines , not by the external explosion he concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine , and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause , from coal in the bunker next to the magazine two experts were brought in to analyze the naval demolitions and ship explosions they concluded that the photos showed '' no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside , '' and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship the second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions in 1998 , national geographic magazine commissioned an analysis by advanced marine enterprises ( ame ) the ame investigation noted that '' the size and location of the soil depression beneath the maine 'is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone ' '' some experts , including admiral rickover 's team and several analysts at ame , do not agree with the conclusion the maine monument in havana describes maines sailors as '' victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of cuba '' , which claims that u.s the army corps of engineers built a cofferdam around the maine and pumped water out from inside it , east potomac park file : mainemonument1200.jpg monument to victims of maine in havana , cuba , c jpg memorial plaque by charles keck , uss maine memorial file : uss maine monument ( 1913 ) , new york city ( p1000124r ) jpg sculpture group by attilio piccirilli at uss maine memorial file : uss maine monument ( 1913 ) , new york city ( p1000126 )

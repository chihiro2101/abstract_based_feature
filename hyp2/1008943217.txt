for a week following the sinking , the journal devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news , editorials and pictures to the event its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to havana , including frederic remington , and hearst announced a reward of 50,000 '' for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 american sailors to their deaths nor did it stop the paper from accusing spain of '' treachery , willingness , or laxness '' for failing to ensure the safety of havana harbor the american public , already agitated over reported spanish atrocities in cuba , was driven to increased hysteria he frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident he quoted an '' officer high in authority '' as saying '' the idea that the catastrophe resulted from an internal accident is preposterous in the first place , such a thing has never occurred before that i have ever heard of either in the british navy or ours '' hearst 's sources never had to be specifically named because he just needed them to support the narrative that the explosion was caused by an attack by the spanish the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion , and the national geographic society did an investigation in 1999 , using computer simulations all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded the spanish inquiry , conducted by del peral and de salas , collected evidence from officers of naval artillery , who had examined the remains of the maine del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion the possibility that other combustibles , such as paint or drier products , had caused the explosion was not discounted additional observations included that : had a mine been the cause of the explosion , a column of water would have been observed the wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact , but only by using electricity , but no cables had been found in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t ramón blanco y erenas , spanish governor of cuba , had proposed instead a joint spanish-american investigation of the sinking rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking , the secretary of the navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally '' eventually , navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board , captain sampson being senior to captain sigsbee the sampson board produced its findings in two parts : the proceedings , which consisted mainly of testimonies , and the findings , which were the facts , as determined by the court captain sampson read commander converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition , with a resulting explosion sinking the ship the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines they reached this conclusion based on the fact that the majority of witnesses stated that they had heard two explosions and that part of the keel was bent inwards the official report from the board , which was presented to the navy department in washington on 21 march , specifically stated the following : wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the threat of war , which had been the case in 1898 , lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously between 20 november and 2 december 1911 , a court of inquiry headed by rear admiral charles e they concluded that an external explosion had triggered the explosion of the magazines this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the sampson board the vreeland board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines , not by the external explosion he published a book about this investigation in 1976 entitled how the battleship maine was destroyed in the 2001 book theodore roosevelt , the u.s navy and the spanish–american war , wegner revisits the rickover investigation and offers additional details navy '' made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy they concluded that the photos showed '' no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside , '' and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship wegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the rickover study in addition , there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal : iron sulfide , also known as pyrite , was likely present pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally experienced spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine this process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams , which exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section , through which jets of water were pumped , to break the mud seal holding the ship , then plugged , with flood cocks , which would later be used for sinking the ship in february 1898 , the recovered bodies of sailors who died on maine were interred in the colon cemetery , havana in 1914 , one of maines six anchors was taken from the washington navy yard to city park in reading , pennsylvania , and dedicated during a ceremony presided over by franklin d one of the ship 's anchors was donated to the city of reading , pennsylvania

nevertheless , this did not stop the world from insisting that the only '' atonement '' spain could offer the u.s for the loss of ship and life , was the granting of complete cuban independence he frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident in the first place , such a thing has never occurred before that i have ever heard of either in the british navy or ours maines destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with spain , but the event created an atmosphere that precluded a peaceful solution the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo the mckinley administration did not cite the explosion as a casus belli , but others were already inclined to go to war with spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in cuba advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded the spanish inquiry , conducted by del peral and de salas , collected evidence from officers of naval artillery , who had examined the remains of the maine del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion hugh thomas , memoria del 98 ( 1997 edition ) , chapter 7 ( '' la explosión del maine '' ) , p in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t captain sigsbee had written that '' many spanish officers , including representatives of general blanco , now with us to express sympathy '' in a cable , the spanish minister of colonies , segismundo moret , had advised blanco '' to gather every fact you can , to prove the maine catastrophe can not be attributed to us instead , he fell back on protocol and assigned the commander-in-chief of the north atlantic squadron to do so the commander produced a list of junior line officers for the board the board arrived on 21 february and took testimony from survivors , witnesses , and divers ( who were sent down to investigate the wreck ) between the proceedings and the findings , there was what wegner calls , '' a broad gap '' , where the court '' left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the often-inconsistent witnesses to its conclusion '' another inconsistency , according to wegner , was that of only one technical witness , commander george converse , from the torpedo station at newport , rhode island the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines they reached this conclusion based on the fact that the majority of witnesses stated that they had heard two explosions and that part of the keel was bent inwards the official report from the board , which was presented to the navy department in washington on 21 march , specifically stated the following : 1911 vreeland board 's court of inquiry wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the threat of war , which had been the case in 1898 , lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously moreover , since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers , they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been beginning in december 1910 , a cofferdam was built around the wreck and water was pumped out , exposing the wreck by late 1911 this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the sampson board rickover became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation in 1974 , using information from the two official inquiries , newspapers , personal papers , and information on the construction and ammunition of maine he concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine , and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause , from coal in the bunker next to the magazine navy '' made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy wegner says that all relevant documents were obtained and studied , including the ship 's plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of maine in 1912 ( the progress of the cofferdam ) written by william furgueson , chief engineer for the project they concluded that the photos showed '' no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside , '' and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship up to the time of the maines building , he explains , common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers , and american naval ships burned smokeless anthracite coal with an increase in the number of steel ships , the navy switched to bituminous coal , which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal and allowed ships to steam faster pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally experienced spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire could have taken place and ignited the ship 's ammunition in an echo of the yellow press headlines of the earlier period , it used the phrase '' a 'remember the maine incident '' in february 1898 , the recovered bodies of sailors who died on maine were interred in the colon cemetery , havana 1930 file : gun recovered from the uss maine.jpg a 6-inch gun from maine at fort allen park in portland , maine file : u.s jpg memorial plaque by

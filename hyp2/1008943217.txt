'' both papers exaggerated and distorted any information they could obtain , sometimes even fabricating news when none that fitted their agenda was available the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo the mckinley administration did not cite the explosion as a casus belli , but others were already inclined to go to war with spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in cuba advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking in addition to the inquiry commissioned by the spanish government to naval officers del peral and de salas , two naval courts of inquiry were ordered : the sampson board in 1898 and the vreeland board in 1911 rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion , and the national geographic society did an investigation in 1999 , using computer simulations the spanish inquiry , conducted by del peral and de salas , collected evidence from officers of naval artillery , who had examined the remains of the maine del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion additional observations included that : had a mine been the cause of the explosion , a column of water would have been observed the wind and the waters were calm on that date and hence a mine could not have been detonated by contact , but only by using electricity , but no cables had been found munition stores do not usually explode when a ship is sunk by a mine hugh thomas , memoria del 98 ( 1997 edition ) , chapter 7 ( '' la explosión del maine '' ) , p 1898 sampson board 's court of inquiry ramón blanco y erenas , spanish governor of cuba , had proposed instead a joint spanish-american investigation of the sinking captain sigsbee had written that '' many spanish officers , including representatives of general blanco , now with us to express sympathy '' in a cable , the spanish minister of colonies , segismundo moret , had advised blanco '' to gather every fact you can , to prove the maine catastrophe can not be attributed to us rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking , the secretary of the navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally '' eventually , navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board , captain sampson being senior to captain sigsbee the board arrived on 21 february and took testimony from survivors , witnesses , and divers ( who were sent down to investigate the wreck ) captain sampson read commander converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition , with a resulting explosion sinking the ship commander converse '' simply stated , without elaboration , that he could not realize such an event happening '' the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines the official report from the board , which was presented to the navy department in washington on 21 march , specifically stated the following : besides the desire for a more thorough investigation , this would also facilitate the recovery of the bodies of the victims , so they could be buried in the united states moreover , since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers , they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been they concluded that an external explosion had triggered the explosion of the magazines the vreeland board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines , not by the external explosion he concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine , and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause , from coal in the bunker next to the magazine navy and the spanish–american war , wegner revisits the rickover investigation and offers additional details navy '' made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy rickover asked whether they could investigate the matter , and they agreed they concluded that the photos showed '' no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside , '' and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship up to the time of the maines building , he explains , common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers , and american naval ships burned smokeless anthracite coal pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally experienced spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine this process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams , which exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water a number of bunker fires of this type had been reported aboard warships before the maines explosion , in several cases nearly sinking the ships the team noted that this was not '' definitive in proving that a mine was the cause of the sinking '' but it did '' strengthen the case '' the maine monument in havana describes maines sailors as '' victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of cuba '' , which claims that u.s holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section , through which jets of water were pumped , to break the mud seal holding the ship , then plugged , with flood cocks , which would later be used for sinking the ship in february 1898 , the recovered bodies of sailors who died on maine were interred in the colon cemetery ,

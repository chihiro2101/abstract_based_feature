the new york journal and new york world , owned respectively by william randolph hearst and joseph pulitzer , gave maine intense press coverage , employing tactics that would later be labeled '' yellow journalism for a week following the sinking , the journal devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news , editorials and pictures to the event its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to havana , including frederic remington , and hearst announced a reward of 50,000 '' for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 american sailors to their deaths for the loss of ship and life , was the granting of complete cuban independence william randolph hearst 's reporting on maine whipped up support for military action against the spanish in cuba regardless of their actual involvement in the sinking he frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident in the first place , such a thing has never occurred before that i have ever heard of either in the british navy or ours '' hearst 's sources never had to be specifically named because he just needed them to support the narrative that the explosion was caused by an attack by the spanish maines destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with spain , but the event created an atmosphere that precluded a peaceful solution the spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers , but the sampson board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo advocates of war used the rallying cry , '' remember the maine ! to hell with spain ! '' the spanish–american war began on april 21 , 1898 , two months after the sinking in addition to the inquiry commissioned by the spanish government to naval officers del peral and de salas , two naval courts of inquiry were ordered : the sampson board in 1898 and the vreeland board in 1911 rickover commissioned a private investigation into the explosion , and the national geographic society did an investigation in 1999 , using computer simulations all investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship , but different conclusions were reached as to how the magazines could have exploded the spanish inquiry , conducted by del peral and de salas , collected evidence from officers of naval artillery , who had examined the remains of the maine del peral and de salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker , located adjacent to the munition stores in maine , as the likely cause of the explosion additional observations included that : had a mine been the cause of the explosion , a column of water would have been observed in order to find the cause of the explosion , a naval inquiry was ordered by the united states shortly after the incident , headed by captain william t '' in a cable , the spanish minister of colonies , segismundo moret , had advised blanco '' to gather every fact you can , to prove the maine catastrophe can not be attributed to us rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking , the secretary of the navy had the option of selecting a board of inquiry personally the commander produced a list of junior line officers for the board '' eventually , navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board , captain sampson being senior to captain sigsbee '' another inconsistency , according to wegner , was that of only one technical witness , commander george converse , from the torpedo station at newport , rhode island captain sampson read commander converse a hypothetical situation of a coal bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition , with a resulting explosion sinking the ship the board concluded that maine had been blown up by a mine , which , in turn , caused the explosion of her forward magazines the official report from the board , which was presented to the navy department in washington on 21 march , specifically stated the following : besides the desire for a more thorough investigation , this would also facilitate the recovery of the bodies of the victims , so they could be buried in the united states the fact that the cuban government wanted the wreck removed from havana harbor might also have played a role : it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898 , while simultaneously obliging the now-independent cubans this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the sampson board the vreeland board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines , not by the external explosion rickover became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation in 1974 , using information from the two official inquiries , newspapers , personal papers , and information on the construction and ammunition of maine he concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine , and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause , from coal in the bunker next to the magazine navy and the spanish–american war , wegner revisits the rickover investigation and offers additional details navy '' made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy '' the historians were working with rickover on a study of the navy 's nuclear propulsion program , but they said that they knew no details of maines sinking they concluded that the photos showed '' no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside , '' and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship wegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the rickover study up to the time of the maines building , he explains , common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers , and american naval ships burned smokeless anthracite coal wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire could have taken place and ignited the ship 's ammunition the ame investigation noted that '' the size and location of the soil depression beneath the maine 'is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone ' '' , east potomac park file : mainemonument1200.jpg monument to victims of maine in

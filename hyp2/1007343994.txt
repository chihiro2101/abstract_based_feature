the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder they then pass down along the sides of the pelvis and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides at the back of the bladder the ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder in the contracted bladder , they are about apart and about the same distance from the internal urethral orifice ; in the distended bladder , these measurements may be increased to about a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder in its upper part , the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle and sits just behind the peritoneum in the lower part of the abdomen , the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the terminal ileum , and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon as the ureters enter the pelvis , they are surrounded by connective tissue , and travel backward and outward , passing in front of the internal iliac arteries and internal iliac veins from here , in males , they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter the bladder near the trigone in females , the ureters pass behind the ovaries and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus the upper third of the ureter , closest to the kidney , is supplied by the renal artery the middle part of the ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries , direct branches from the abdominal aorta , and gonadal artery ; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery in men and the ovarian artery in women the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries the arterial supply can be variable , with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery , branches directly from the aorta , and , in women , the uterine and vaginal arteries there are many connections between the arteries of the ureter , particularly in the adventitia , which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter lymphatic drainage depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter those vessels closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels , and from here into the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels the middle part of the ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right , and the left paraaortic nodes on the left in the lower ureter , lymph may drain into the common iliac lymph nodes , or lower down in the pelvis to the common , external , or internal iliac lymph nodes the ureters are richly supplied by nerves that form a network of nerves , the ureteric plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters the ureter is lined by urothelium , a type of transitional epithelium that is capable of responding to stretches in the ureters here , the ureter ( in orange ) can be seen emerging from the bottom of the mesonephric duct ( labelled '' wolffian duct '' ) , connected to the primitive bladder finally , the entry points of the ureters into the bladder move upwards , owing to the upward migration of the kidneys in the developing embryo this may involve reinserting the ureters into a new place on the bladder ( reimplantion ) , or widening of the ureter after the cancer is staged , treatment may involve open surgery to remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved ; or , if the lesion is small , it may be removed via ureteroscopy more invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy , which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters

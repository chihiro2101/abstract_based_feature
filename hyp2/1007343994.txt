the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder the ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder the ureters enter the bladder from its back surface , traveling before opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like ureteric orifices a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder in its upper part , the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle and sits just behind the peritoneum the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta sit to the midline of the right and left ureters , respectively as the ureters enter the pelvis , they are surrounded by connective tissue , and travel backward and outward , passing in front of the internal iliac arteries and internal iliac veins from here , in males , they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter the bladder near the trigone the upper third of the ureter , closest to the kidney , is supplied by the renal artery the middle part of the ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries , direct branches from the abdominal aorta , and gonadal artery ; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery in men and the ovarian artery in women the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries the artery that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of the ureters there are many connections between the arteries of the ureter , particularly in the adventitia , which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter the ureters are richly supplied by nerves that form a network of nerves , the ureteric plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters the ureter is lined by urothelium , a type of transitional epithelium that is capable of responding to stretches in the ureters the transitional epithelium may appear as a layer of columnar epithelia when relaxed , and of flatter cells when distended beyond these layers sits an adventitia containing blood vessels , lymphatic vessels , and veins eventually , successive divisions from these buds form not only the ureters , but also the pelvis , major and minor calyces , and collecting ducts of the kidneys over time , as the bladder enlarges , it absorbs the surrounding parts of the primitive ureters the ureters are a component of the urinary system urine , produced by the kidneys , travels along the ureters to the bladder file : ultrasound_demonstration_of_ureteral_jet_effect_0301105703_1105300.gif ultrasound showing a jet of urine entering the bladder ( large black section ) through the ureter this may involve reinserting the ureters into a new place on the bladder ( reimplantion ) , or widening of the ureter it is usually due to cancer of the urothelium , the cells that line the surface of the ureters more invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy , which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad

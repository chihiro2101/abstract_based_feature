the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder from the renal pelvis , they descend on top of the psoas major muscle to reach the pelvic brim they then pass down along the sides of the pelvis and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides at the back of the bladder the ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder the ureters enter the bladder from its back surface , traveling before opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like ureteric orifices a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder in its upper part , the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle and sits just behind the peritoneum the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta sit to the midline of the right and left ureters , respectively from here , in males , they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter the bladder near the trigone they then pass by the cervix , traveling inward towards the bladder the upper third of the ureter , closest to the kidney , is supplied by the renal artery the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries the artery that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of the ureters there are many connections between the arteries of the ureter , particularly in the adventitia , which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter those vessels closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels , and from here into the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels the transitional epithelium may appear as a layer of columnar epithelia when relaxed , and of flatter cells when distended the ureter is surrounded by two muscular layers , an inner longitudinal layer of muscle , and an outer circular or spiral layer of muscle over time , the buds elongate , moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue , dilate , and divide into left and right ureters the ureters are a component of the urinary system urine , produced by the kidneys , travels along the ureters to the bladder vesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into the ureters medical imaging , including urinary tract ultrasound , ct or nuclear medicine imaging is conducted to investigate many causes it is usually due to cancer of the urothelium , the cells that line the surface of the ureters several forms of medical imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad the insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis , bypassing the uterers and urinary tract , called nephrostomy , was first described in 1941

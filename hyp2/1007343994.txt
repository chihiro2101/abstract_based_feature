the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder they then pass down along the sides of the pelvis and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides at the back of the bladder the ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder the ureters enter the bladder from its back surface , traveling before opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like ureteric orifices in the contracted bladder , they are about apart and about the same distance from the internal urethral orifice ; in the distended bladder , these measurements may be increased to about a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder in the lower part of the abdomen , the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the terminal ileum , and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon as the ureters enter the pelvis , they are surrounded by connective tissue , and travel backward and outward , passing in front of the internal iliac arteries and internal iliac veins they then travel inward and forward , crossing the umbilical , inferior vesical , and middle rectal arteries in females , the ureters pass behind the ovaries and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus the upper third of the ureter , closest to the kidney , is supplied by the renal artery the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries there are many connections between the arteries of the ureter , particularly in the adventitia , which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter the ureters are richly supplied by nerves that form a network of nerves , the ureteric plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters sensation to the ureters is provided by nerves that come from t11 - l2 segments of the spinal cord the ureter is lined by urothelium , a type of transitional epithelium that is capable of responding to stretches in the ureters the transitional epithelium may appear as a layer of columnar epithelia when relaxed , and of flatter cells when distended image : gray1116.png thumb right 300px image showing the bottom part of an embryo 4 - 5 weeks old here , the ureter ( in orange ) can be seen emerging from the bottom of the mesonephric duct ( labelled '' wolffian duct '' ) , connected to the primitive bladder over time , the buds elongate , moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue , dilate , and divide into left and right ureters over time , as the bladder enlarges , it absorbs the surrounding parts of the primitive ureters urine , produced by the kidneys , travels along the ureters to the bladder this may involve reinserting the ureters into a new place on the bladder ( reimplantion ) , or widening of the ureter more invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy , which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad the first to examine the ureter through an internal approach , called ureteroscopy , rather than surgery was hampton young in 1929

the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder here , they cross in front of the common iliac artery they then pass down along the sides of the pelvis and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides at the back of the bladder the ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder the ureters enter the bladder from its back surface , traveling before opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like ureteric orifices a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder in its upper part , the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle and sits just behind the peritoneum from here , in males , they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter the bladder near the trigone in females , the ureters pass behind the ovaries and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus the upper third of the ureter , closest to the kidney , is supplied by the renal artery the artery that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of the ureters lymphatic drainage depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter the ureters are richly supplied by nerves that form a network of nerves , the ureteric plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters the lower third of the ureter has a third muscular layer here , the ureter ( in orange ) can be seen emerging from the bottom of the mesonephric duct ( labelled '' wolffian duct '' ) , connected to the primitive bladder the urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus the ureters are a component of the urinary system urine , produced by the kidneys , travels along the ureters to the bladder file : ultrasound_demonstration_of_ureteral_jet_effect_0301105703_1105300.gif ultrasound showing a jet of urine entering the bladder ( large black section ) through the ureter pain often comes in waves lasting up to two hours , then subsides , called renal colic this condition can be associated with urinary tract infections , particularly in children , and is present in up to 28â€“36 % of children to some degree a number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis of the condition , with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound , mag 3 nuclear medicine scaning , and a micturition urethrocystogram medical imaging , including urinary tract ultrasound , ct or nuclear medicine imaging is conducted to investigate many causes it is usually due to cancer of the urothelium , the cells that line the surface of the ureters several forms of medical imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad

the ureters are tubular structures , approximately in adults , that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into the bladder they then pass down along the sides of the pelvis and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides at the back of the bladder the ureters are in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for near their ends just before they enter the bladder the ureters enter the bladder from its back surface , traveling before opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like ureteric orifices in the contracted bladder , they are about apart and about the same distance from the internal urethral orifice ; in the distended bladder , these measurements may be increased to about a number of structures pass by , above , and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the bladder in its upper part , the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle and sits just behind the peritoneum as the ureters enter the pelvis , they are surrounded by connective tissue , and travel backward and outward , passing in front of the internal iliac arteries and internal iliac veins the upper third of the ureter , closest to the kidney , is supplied by the renal artery the lower third of the ureter , closest to the bladder , is supplied by branches from the internal iliac artery , mainly the superior and inferior vesical arteries the artery that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of the ureters there are many connections between the arteries of the ureter , particularly in the adventitia , which means damage to a single vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter the middle part of the ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right , and the left paraaortic nodes on the left the ureter is lined by urothelium , a type of transitional epithelium that is capable of responding to stretches in the ureters the lamina propria is made up of loose connective tissue with many elastic fibers interspersed with blood vessels , veins and lymphatics here , the ureter ( in orange ) can be seen emerging from the bottom of the mesonephric duct ( labelled '' wolffian duct '' ) , connected to the primitive bladder the urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus urine , produced by the kidneys , travels along the ureters to the bladder a kidney stone can move from the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter , which can block the flow of urine , as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back , side , or lower abdomen pain often comes in waves lasting up to two hours , then subsides , called renal colic blockage , or obstruction of the ureter can occur , as a result of narrowing within the ureter , or compression or fibrosis of structures around the ureter a narrowed ureter may lead to ureteric enlargement and cause swelling of the kidneys ( hydronephrosis ) associated symptoms may include recurrent infections , pain or haematuria ; and when tested , kidney function might be seen to decrease more invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy , which is the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters the duct that connects the kidney to excrete urine in these animals is the ureter the urinary tract including the ureters , as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys , has been described by galen in the second century ad

voegelin identified the root of the gnostic impulse as alienation , ( a sense of disconnection with society ) and a belief that the disconnection is the result of the inherent disorder or even evil of the world the alienation has two effects : the belief that the disorder of the world can be transcended by extraordinary insight , learning , or knowledge , called a gnostic speculation by voegelin ( the gnostics themselves referred to it as gnosis ) the desire to create and implement a policy to actualize the speculation , or as voegelin described it , to immanentize the eschaton , to create a sort of heaven on earth within history by triggering the apocalypse voegelin 's conception of gnosis , and his analysis of gnosticism in general was criticized by eugene webb in the article '' voegelin 's gnosticism reconsidered , '' webb explained that voegelin 's concept of gnosticism was conceived '' not primarily to describe ancient phenomena but to help us understand some modern ones for which the evidence is a great deal clearer and the fact that the idea of gnosticism as such has become so problematic and complex in recent years must at the very least undercut voegelin 's effort to trace a historical line of descent from ancient sources to the modern phenomena he tried to use them to illuminate he did not speculate on the institutional forms in which a spiritual recovery might take place but expressed confidence that the current 500-year cycle of secularism would come to an end because he stated that '' you can not deny the human forever '' in an essay published in 1965 , '' in search of the ground '' , published essays , 1953—1965 , p 239 ( collected works vol 11 ) voegelin suggested that the soviet union would collapse from within because of its historical roots in philosophy and christianity later , at an informal talk given at university college , dublin , ireland in 1972 , the irish dialogue with eric voegelin : eric voegelin informal talk at university college , dublin in 1972 , recorded and transcribed by brendan purcell voegelin suggested the soviet union might collapse by 1980 because of its failure to succeed in its domestic commitments and external political challenges matthes & seitz , berlin 2007 , conversations with eric voegelin , mitschrift von vier vorlesungen in montreal in den jahren 1965 , 1967 , 1970 , 1976 thomas more institute , montreal 1980 briefwechsel 1939–1949 : eric voegelin und hermann broch , in : sinn und form , heft 2/2008 , s 149–174 briefwechsel , eric voegelin und karl löwith , in : sinn und form , heft 6/2007 , s thompson volume 23 : history of political ideas , volume v , religion and the rise of modernity , edited by james l cooper , barry : eric voegelin and the foundations of modern political science , university of missouri press , 1999 federici , michael : eric voegelin : the restoration of order , isi books 2002 , basic introduction

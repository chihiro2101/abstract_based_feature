elemental aluminium can not be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt , because hydronium ions readily redox elemental aluminium although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process , alumina , al 2 o 3 , is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite , na 3 alf 6 , to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of in industrial production , alf 3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2–3 to further reduce the melting point , so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 & nbsp ; °c the density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 & nbsp ; g/ml , so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell this causes liquid aluminium metal to be deposited at the cathode , while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce mostly carbon dioxide while solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature , liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around the electrolytic mixture is sprinkled with coke to prevent the anode 's oxidation by the oxygen evolved the exhaust is primarily co 2 produced from the anode consumption and hydrogen fluoride ( hf ) from the cryolite and flux ( alf 3 ) the materials most often used in anodes , coke and pitch resin , are mainly residues from the petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte there are two primary anode technologies using the hall–héroult process : söderberg technology and prebaked technology the anode is contained within a frame and , as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into co 2 during the electrolysis , the anode loses mass and , being amorphous , it slowly sinks within its frame this smaller distance decreases the resistance caused by the electrolyte mixture and increases the efficiency of prebaked anodes over söderberg anodes prebake technology also has much lower risk of the anode effect ( see below ) , but cells using it are more expensive to build and labor-intensive to use , as each prebaked anode in a cell needs to be removed and replaced once it has been used the anode effect is mainly a problem in söderberg technology cells , not in prebaked

elemental aluminium can not be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt , because hydronium ions readily redox elemental aluminium although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process , alumina , al 2 o 3 , is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite , na 3 alf 6 , to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of aluminium fluoride ( alf 3 ) is usually added to the electrolyte in industrial production , alf 3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2–3 to further reduce the melting point , so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 & nbsp ; °c this causes liquid aluminium metal to be deposited at the cathode , while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce mostly carbon dioxide while solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature , liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around the aluminium sinks to the bottom of the electrolytic cell , where it is periodically collected in non-agitating static pool cells , the impurities either rise to the top of the metallic aluminium , or sink to the bottom , leaving high-purity aluminium in the middle area there are two primary anode technologies using the hall–héroult process : söderberg technology and prebaked technology in cells using söderberg or self-baking anodes , there is a single anode per electrolysis cell compared to söderberg anodes , computer-controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis prebaked anodes are either made in the same factory where electrolysis happens , or are brought there from elsewhere the anode effect decreases the energy-efficiency and the aluminium production of the cell in 1997 , the hall–héroult process was designated a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society in recognition of the importance of the process in the commercialization of aluminium

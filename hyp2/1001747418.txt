elemental aluminium can not be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt , because hydronium ions readily redox elemental aluminium although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process , alumina , al 2 o 3 , is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite , na 3 alf 6 , to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis the carbon source is generally a coke ( fuel ) in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of in industrial production , alf 3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2–3 to further reduce the melting point , so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 & nbsp ; °c the density of liquid aluminum is 2.3 & nbsp ; g/ml at temperatures between 950 and 1000 & nbsp ; °c the density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 & nbsp ; g/ml , so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell the theoretical minimum energy requirement for this process is 6.23 kwh/ ( kg of al ) , but the process commonly requires 15.37 kwh while solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature , liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around the aluminium sinks to the bottom of the electrolytic cell , where it is periodically collected the materials most often used in anodes , coke and pitch resin , are mainly residues from the petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte there are two primary anode technologies using the hall–héroult process : söderberg technology and prebaked technology compared to söderberg anodes , computer-controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis prior to the hall–héroult process , elemental aluminium was made by heating ore along with elemental sodium or potassium in a vacuum in 1997 , the hall–héroult process was designated a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society in recognition of the importance of the process in the commercialization of aluminium

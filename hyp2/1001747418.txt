elemental aluminium can not be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt , because hydronium ions readily redox elemental aluminium although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process , alumina , al 2 o 3 , is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite , na 3 alf 6 , to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of aluminium fluoride ( alf 3 ) is usually added to the electrolyte the density of liquid aluminum is 2.3 & nbsp ; g/ml at temperatures between 950 and 1000 & nbsp ; °c the density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 & nbsp ; g/ml , so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell this causes liquid aluminium metal to be deposited at the cathode , while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce mostly carbon dioxide the theoretical minimum energy requirement for this process is 6.23 kwh/ ( kg of al ) , but the process commonly requires 15.37 kwh while solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature , liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around the aluminium sinks to the bottom of the electrolytic cell , where it is periodically collected in cells using söderberg or self-baking anodes , there is a single anode per electrolysis cell the baking process in söderberg anodes during electrolysis releases more carcinogenic pahs and other pollutants than electrolysis with prebaked anodes and , partially for this reason , prebaked anode-using cells have become more common in the aluminium industry this smaller distance decreases the resistance caused by the electrolyte mixture and increases the efficiency of prebaked anodes over söderberg anodes the hall–héroult process was invented independently and almost simultaneously in 1886 by the american chemist charles martin hall and by the france paul héroult héroult , paul ; french patent no aluminum produced via the hall–héroult process , in combination with cheaper electric power , helped make aluminium ( and incidentally magnesium ) an inexpensive commodity rather than a precious metal

elemental aluminium can not be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt , because hydronium ions readily redox elemental aluminium although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead , aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 & nbsp ; °c so electrolysing it is impractical in the hall–héroult process , alumina , al 2 o 3 , is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite , na 3 alf 6 , to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis in the hall–héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes : cathode : anode : overall : in reality , much more carbon dioxide is formed at the anode than co : pure cryolite has a melting point of aluminium fluoride ( alf 3 ) is usually added to the electrolyte in industrial production , alf 3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2–3 to further reduce the melting point , so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 & nbsp ; °c the density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 & nbsp ; g/ml , so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell the theoretical minimum energy requirement for this process is 6.23 kwh/ ( kg of al ) , but the process commonly requires 15.37 kwh oxidation of the carbon anode increases the electrical efficiency at a cost of consuming the carbon electrodes and producing carbon dioxide while solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature , liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around the aluminium sinks to the bottom of the electrolytic cell , where it is periodically collected agitation of the molten material in the cell increases its production rate at the expense of an increase in cryolite impurities in the product there are two primary anode technologies using the hall–héroult process : söderberg technology and prebaked technology cathodes also degrade during electrolysis , but much more slowly than anodes do , and thus they need neither be as high in purity , nor be maintained as often the hall–héroult process was invented independently and almost simultaneously in 1886 by the american chemist charles martin hall and by the france paul héroult héroult , paul ; french patent no in 1997 , the hall–héroult process was designated a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society in recognition of the importance of the process in the commercialization of aluminium

thus , proteins , polysaccharides , and polynucleic acids are excellent polydentate ligands for many metal ions organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators the marine mussels use metal chelation esp fe 3+ chelation with the dopa residues in mussel foot protein-1 to improve the strength of the threads that they use to secure themselves to surfaces , peptides and sugars ) that extract metal ions from minerals and rocks most metal complexes in the environment and in nature are bound in some form of chelate ring ( e.g thus , metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil , the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms in the 1960s , scientists developed the concept of chelating a metal ion prior to feeding the element to the animal amino acids , being effective metal binders , were chosen as the prospective ligands , and research was conducted on the metalâ€“amino acid combinations chelation using calcium disodium edta has been approved by the u.s chelate complexes of gadolinium are often used as contrast agents in mris , although iron particle and manganese chelate complexes have also been explored , and the gadolinium complexes often employ the usage of octadentate ligands such as dtpa , according to desreux et al chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) edta is the typical chelating agent that keeps these metal ions in a soluble form

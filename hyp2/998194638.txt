the thermodynamic principles underpinning the chelate effect are illustrated by the contrasting affinities of copper ( ii ) for ethylenediamine ( en ) vs thus , proteins , polysaccharides , and polynucleic acids are excellent polydentate ligands for many metal ions organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators many microbial species produce water-soluble pigments that serve as chelating agents , termed siderophores the marine mussels use metal chelation esp , peptides and sugars ) that extract metal ions from minerals and rocks thus , metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil , the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms amino acids , being effective metal binders , were chosen as the prospective ligands , and research was conducted on the metal–amino acid combinations the research supported that the metal–amino acid chelates were able to enhance mineral absorption if the mineral was taken from the edta ligand , the ligand could not be used by the body and would be expelled chelating agents convert these metal ions into a chemically and biochemically inert form that can be excreted chelate complexes of gadolinium are often used as contrast agents in mris , although iron particle and manganese chelate complexes have also been explored although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level most fertilizers contain phosphate salts that , in the absence of chelating agents , typically convert these metal ions into insoluble solids that are of no nutritional value to the plants

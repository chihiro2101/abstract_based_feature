the thermodynamic principles underpinning the chelate effect are illustrated by the contrasting affinities of copper ( ii ) for ethylenediamine ( en ) vs organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators virtually all metalloenzymes feature metals that are chelated , usually to peptides or cofactors and prosthetic groups . such chelating agents include the porphyrin rings in hemoglobin and chlorophyll in earth science , chemical weathering is attributed to organic chelating agents ( e.g , peptides and sugars ) that extract metal ions from minerals and rocks selective chelation of heavy metals is relevant to bioremediation ( e.g in the 1960s , scientists developed the concept of chelating a metal ion prior to feeding the element to the animal these applied the same concept of chelation and did create chelated compounds ; but these synthetics were too stable and not nutritionally viable if the mineral was taken from the edta ligand , the ligand could not be used by the body and would be expelled chelation therapy is an antidote for poisoning by mercury , arsenic , and lead chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) chelators are used in water treatment programs and specifically in steam engineering , e.g the word chelation is derived from greek χηλή , chēlē , meaning '' claw '' ; the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a lobster

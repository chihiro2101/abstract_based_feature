thus , proteins , polysaccharides , and polynucleic acids are excellent polydentate ligands for many metal ions organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators in addition to these adventitious chelators , several biomolecules are specifically produced to bind certain metals ( see next section ) the marine mussels use metal chelation esp most metal complexes in the environment and in nature are bound in some form of chelate ring ( e.g thus , metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil , the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms amino acids , being effective metal binders , were chosen as the prospective ligands , and research was conducted on the metal–amino acid combinations these applied the same concept of chelation and did create chelated compounds ; but these synthetics were too stable and not nutritionally viable chelation therapy is an antidote for poisoning by mercury , arsenic , and lead disodium edta is not approved by the fda for any use , and all fda-approved chelation therapy products require a prescription chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level edta is the typical chelating agent that keeps these metal ions in a soluble form the word chelation is derived from greek χηλή , chēlē , meaning '' claw '' ; the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a lobster

the thermodynamic principles underpinning the chelate effect are illustrated by the contrasting affinities of copper ( ii ) for ethylenediamine ( en ) vs thus , proteins , polysaccharides , and polynucleic acids are excellent polydentate ligands for many metal ions organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators the marine mussels use metal chelation esp in earth science , chemical weathering is attributed to organic chelating agents ( e.g thus , metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil , the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms selective chelation of heavy metals is relevant to bioremediation ( e.g in the 1960s , scientists developed the concept of chelating a metal ion prior to feeding the element to the animal amino acids , being effective metal binders , were chosen as the prospective ligands , and research was conducted on the metal–amino acid combinations the research supported that the metal–amino acid chelates were able to enhance mineral absorption chelation using calcium disodium edta has been approved by the u.s chelate complexes of gadolinium are often used as contrast agents in mris , although iron particle and manganese chelate complexes have also been explored although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level edta is the typical chelating agent that keeps these metal ions in a soluble form

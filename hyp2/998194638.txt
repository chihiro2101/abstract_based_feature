the thermodynamic principles underpinning the chelate effect are illustrated by the contrasting affinities of copper ( ii ) for ethylenediamine ( en ) vs in general it is difficult to account precisely for thermodynamic values in terms of changes in solution at the molecular level , but it is clear that the chelate effect is predominantly an effect of entropy thus , proteins , polysaccharides , and polynucleic acids are excellent polydentate ligands for many metal ions organic compounds such as the amino acids glutamic acid and histidine , organic diacids such as malate , and polypeptides such as phytochelatin are also typical chelators in addition to these adventitious chelators , several biomolecules are specifically produced to bind certain metals ( see next section ) the marine mussels use metal chelation esp fe 3+ chelation with the dopa residues in mussel foot protein-1 to improve the strength of the threads that they use to secure themselves to surfaces in earth science , chemical weathering is attributed to organic chelating agents ( e.g thus , metal chelates are relevant to the mobilization of metals in the soil , the uptake and the accumulation of metals into plants and microorganisms amino acids , being effective metal binders , were chosen as the prospective ligands , and research was conducted on the metalâ€“amino acid combinations chelation using calcium disodium edta has been approved by the u.s chelation in the intestinal tract is a cause of numerous interactions between drugs and metal ions ( also known as '' minerals '' in nutrition ) although the treatment is often referred to as '' softening , '' chelation has little effect on the water 's mineral content , other than to make it soluble and lower the water 's ph level edta is the typical chelating agent that keeps these metal ions in a soluble form

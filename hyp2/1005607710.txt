mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper according to the prevailing classification scheme by lyle campbell and terrence kaufman , the first division occurred around 2200 bce , when huastecan split away from mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the gulf coast of mexico when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages according to an alternative theory by robertson and houston , huastecan stayed in the guatemalan highlands with speakers of chʼolan–tzeltalan , separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by kaufman in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this has led to hypotheses that the early maya were dominated by speakers of mixe–zoquean languages , possibly the olmec this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language yet the maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others , the last independent maya kingdom ( tayasal ) was not conquered until 1697 , some 170 years after the first conquistadores arrived during the colonial and postcolonial periods , maya peoples periodically rebelled against the colonizers , such as the caste war of yucatán , which extended into the 20th century the maya area is now dominated by the spanish language while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language the driving concern of maya communities is not to revitalize their language but to buttress it against the increasingly rapid spread of spanish rather than being at the end of a process of language shift , mayan languages are as maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread , the mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as maya , the heirs of the maya civilization writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' on the other hand , they do recognize the value of mayan language when they wish to claim the 'authentic mayan identity ' '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language see chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of the usage and meanings of the words '' dialect '' and '' language '' in mesoamerica in guatemala , matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the mayan languages are governed by the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ; guatemalan academy of mayan languages ) , which was founded by maya organisations in 1986 similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry examples include linking mayan with the uru–chipaya languages , mapuche , the lencan languages , purépecha and huave mayan has also been included in various hokan and penutian hypotheses the linguist joseph greenberg included mayan in his highly controversial amerind languages , which is rejected by most historical linguists as unsupported by available evidence in 2015 , campbell noted that recent evidence presented by david mora-marin makes the case for a relationship between mayan and mixe-zoquean languages '' much more plausible '' typically , these languages are grouped into 5-6 major subgroups ( yucatecan , huastecan , chʼolan–tzeltalan , qʼanjobʼalan , mamean , and kʼichean ) an alternative proposed classification groups the huastecan branch as springing from the chʼolan–tzeltalan node , rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-mayan node studies estimate that mayan languages are spoken by more than 6 million people most of them live in guatemala where depending on estimates 40 % -60 % of the population speaks a mayan language in mexico the mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010 , whereas the belizean speaker population figures around 30,000 the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas it was previously also spoken in the extreme west of honduras and el salvador , but the salvadorian variant is now extinct and the honduran one is considered moribund chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology , and are closely related to the classic maya language found in the central lowlands gordon ( 2005 ) recognizes eastern and western dialects of jakaltek , as well as mochoʼ ( also called mototzintlec ) , a language with less than 200 speakers in the chiapan villages of tuzantán and mototzintla the quichean–mamean languages and dialects , with two sub-branches and three subfamilies , are spoken in the guatemalan highlands '' maya , yucatec '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) mayan sign language cauque mayan ( mixed language )

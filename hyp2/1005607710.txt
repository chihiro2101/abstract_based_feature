mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper see attribution in terrence kaufman and john justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-mayan language proto-yucatecan and proto-chʼolan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the yucatán peninsula speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by mamean and quichean people when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this has led to hypotheses that the early maya were dominated by speakers of mixe–zoquean languages , possibly the olmec this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' the reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the maya region ; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite they propose that it originated in western and south-central petén basin , and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language the use of mayan languages in many important domains of society , including administration , religion and literature , came to an end yet the maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others , the last independent maya kingdom ( tayasal ) was not conquered until 1697 , some 170 years after the first conquistadores arrived and perhaps for this reason , many maya communities still retain a high proportion of monolingual speakers the maya area is now dominated by the spanish language while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language rather than being at the end of a process of language shift , mayan languages are as maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread , the mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as maya , the heirs of the maya civilization writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' on the one hand , mayans denigrate kʼicheʼ and have doubts about its potential to continue as a viable language because the command of spanish is an economic and political necessity it is this conflation of conflicting and ambivalent ideologies that inform language choice the broader meaning of '' maya '' now current , while defined by linguistic relationships , is also used to refer to ethnic or cultural traits maya , rather , has become a strategy of self-representation for the maya movements and its followers see chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of the usage and meanings of the words '' dialect '' and '' language '' in mesoamerica in guatemala , matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the mayan languages are governed by the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ; guatemalan academy of mayan languages ) , which was founded by maya organisations in 1986 the mayan language family has no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry the linguist joseph greenberg included mayan in his highly controversial amerind languages , which is rejected by most historical linguists as unsupported by available evidence studies estimate that mayan languages are spoken by more than 6 million people in mexico the mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010 , whereas the belizean speaker population figures around 30,000 the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas ethnologue report on chʼol de tila , ethnologue report on chʼol de tumbalá , both accessed march 07 , 2007 chʼortiʼ : a language of guatemala chʼoltiʼ , a sister language of chʼortiʼ , is also extinct '' tzeltal '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) '' lacandon '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) from the classic language to the present day , a body of literature has been written in mayan languages because indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of mexico and guatemala after independence , mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages , learning to read and write in spanish , if at all

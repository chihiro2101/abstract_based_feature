mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper see attribution in terrence kaufman and john justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-mayan language when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages according to an alternative theory by robertson and houston , huastecan stayed in the guatemalan highlands with speakers of chʼolan–tzeltalan , separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by kaufman in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) the split between proto-yucatecan ( in the north , that is , the yucatán peninsula ) and proto-chʼolan ( in the south , that is , the chiapas highlands and petén basin ) had already occurred by the classic period , when most extant glyphic writing were written both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' they propose that it originated in western and south-central petén basin , and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests however , mora-marín has argued that traits shared by classic lowland maya and the chʼoltiʼan languages are retentions rather than innovations , and that the diversification of chʼolan in fact post-dates the classic period during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language the use of mayan languages in many important domains of society , including administration , religion and literature , came to an end yet the maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others , the last independent maya kingdom ( tayasal ) was not conquered until 1697 , some 170 years after the first conquistadores arrived grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' however , there is a complex array of perceptions about mayan language and identity among mayans who i researched in momostenango , a highland maya community in guatemala on the other hand , they do recognize the value of mayan language when they wish to claim the 'authentic mayan identity ' '' the word '' maya '' was likely derived from the postclassical yucatán city of mayapan ; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the yucatán peninsula as '' yucatec '' or '' kʼicheʼ '' ; but they also recognize a shared maya kinship fabri writes : '' the term maya is problematic because maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ) finds twenty-one distinct mayan languages see chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of the usage and meanings of the words '' dialect '' and '' language '' in mesoamerica in guatemala , matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the mayan languages are governed by the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ; guatemalan academy of mayan languages ) , which was founded by maya organisations in 1986 following the 1996 peace accords , it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on mayan languages both among mayan scholars and the maya peoples similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry examples include linking mayan with the uru–chipaya languages , mapuche , the lencan languages , purépecha and huave mayan has also been included in various hokan and penutian hypotheses the linguist joseph greenberg included mayan in his highly controversial amerind languages , which is rejected by most historical linguists as unsupported by available evidence writing in 1997 , lyle campbell , an expert in mayan languages and historical linguistics , argued that the most promising proposal is the '' macro-mayan '' hypothesis , which posits links between mayan , the mixe–zoque languages and the totonacan languages , but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis some scholars think these form a separate western branch ( as in the diagram below ) the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas ethnologue report on chʼol de tila , ethnologue report on chʼol de tumbalá , both accessed march 07 , 2007 its closest relative , the chontal maya language , chontal maya is not to be confused with the tequistlatecan languages that are referred to as '' chontal of oaxaca '' chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology , and are closely related to the classic maya language found in the central lowlands the closest relatives of the chʼolan languages are the languages of the tzeltalan branch , tzotzil and tzeltal , both spoken in chiapas by large and stable or growing populations ( 265,000 for tzotzil and 215,000 for tzeltal ) '' akateko '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) the famous maya mythological document , popol vuh , is written in an antiquated kʼicheʼ often called classical kʼicheʼ language '' maya , yucatec '' ethnologue : languages of the world , eighteenth edition , ( 2015 ) subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) mayan sign language cauque mayan ( mixed language )

mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this has led to hypotheses that the early maya were dominated by speakers of mixe–zoquean languages , possibly the olmec this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language the use of mayan languages in many important domains of society , including administration , religion and literature , came to an end yet the maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others , the last independent maya kingdom ( tayasal ) was not conquered until 1697 , some 170 years after the first conquistadores arrived while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language as maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread , the mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as maya , the heirs of the maya civilization writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' on the other hand , they do recognize the value of mayan language when they wish to claim the 'authentic mayan identity ' '' the word '' maya '' was likely derived from the postclassical yucatán city of mayapan ; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the yucatán peninsula as '' yucatec '' or '' kʼicheʼ '' ; but they also recognize a shared maya kinship maya , rather , has become a strategy of self-representation for the maya movements and its followers '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language the mayan language family has no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion a wide range of proposals have tried to link the mayan family to other language families or isolates , but none is generally supported by linguists the linguist joseph greenberg included mayan in his highly controversial amerind languages , which is rejected by most historical linguists as unsupported by available evidence writing in 1997 , lyle campbell , an expert in mayan languages and historical linguistics , argued that the most promising proposal is the '' macro-mayan '' hypothesis , which posits links between mayan , the mixe–zoque languages and the totonacan languages , but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis the mayan family consists of thirty languages the mayan language family is extremely well documented , and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established , except for some minor unresolved differences an alternative proposed classification groups the huastecan branch as springing from the chʼolan–tzeltalan node , rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-mayan node most of them live in guatemala where depending on estimates 40 % -60 % of the population speaks a mayan language in mexico the mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010 , whereas the belizean speaker population figures around 30,000 the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas its closest relative , the chontal maya language , chontal maya is not to be confused with the tequistlatecan languages that are referred to as '' chontal of oaxaca '' chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology , and are closely related to the classic maya language found in the central lowlands the closest relatives of the chʼolan languages are the languages of the tzeltalan branch , tzotzil and tzeltal , both spoken in chiapas by large and stable or growing populations ( 265,000 for tzotzil and 215,000 for tzeltal ) qʼanjobʼal is spoken by 77,700 in guatemala 's huehuetenango department , with small populations elsewhere the famous maya mythological document , popol vuh , is written in an antiquated kʼicheʼ often called classical kʼicheʼ language yucatec maya ( known simply as '' maya '' to its speakers ) is the most commonly spoken mayan language in mexico it is currently spoken by approximately 800,000 people , the vast majority of whom are to be found on the yucatán peninsula due to subsequent vowel loss many mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at both ends of syllables subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) however , since the establishment of the cordemex and the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( 1986 ) , native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in mayan languages

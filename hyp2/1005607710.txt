mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper see attribution in terrence kaufman and john justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-mayan language proto-yucatecan and proto-chʼolan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the yucatán peninsula when speakers of proto-tzeltalan later separated from the chʼolan group and moved south into the chiapas highlands , they came into contact with speakers of mixe–zoque languages in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this has led to hypotheses that the early maya were dominated by speakers of mixe–zoquean languages , possibly the olmec this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) during the classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages however , mora-marín has argued that traits shared by classic lowland maya and the chʼoltiʼan languages are retentions rather than innovations , and that the diversification of chʼolan in fact post-dates the classic period during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language the use of mayan languages in many important domains of society , including administration , religion and literature , came to an end yet the maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others , the last independent maya kingdom ( tayasal ) was not conquered until 1697 , some 170 years after the first conquistadores arrived the maya area is now dominated by the spanish language while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' however , there is a complex array of perceptions about mayan language and identity among mayans who i researched in momostenango , a highland maya community in guatemala the broader meaning of '' maya '' now current , while defined by linguistic relationships , is also used to refer to ethnic or cultural traits fabri writes : '' the term maya is problematic because maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity the mayan language family has no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry a wide range of proposals have tried to link the mayan family to other language families or isolates , but none is generally supported by linguists examples include linking mayan with the uru–chipaya languages , mapuche , the lencan languages , purépecha and huave in 2015 , campbell noted that recent evidence presented by david mora-marin makes the case for a relationship between mayan and mixe-zoquean languages '' much more plausible '' the mayan family consists of thirty languages typically , these languages are grouped into 5-6 major subgroups ( yucatecan , huastecan , chʼolan–tzeltalan , qʼanjobʼalan , mamean , and kʼichean ) other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between chʼolan and qʼanjobalan–chujean ; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language an alternative proposed classification groups the huastecan branch as springing from the chʼolan–tzeltalan node , rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-mayan node most of them live in guatemala where depending on estimates 40 % -60 % of the population speaks a mayan language in mexico the mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010 , whereas the belizean speaker population figures around 30,000 the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas gordon , raymond g ethnologue report on chʼol de tila , ethnologue report on chʼol de tumbalá , both accessed march 07 , 2007 its closest relative , the chontal maya language , chontal maya is not to be confused with the tequistlatecan languages that are referred to as '' chontal of oaxaca '' is spoken by 55,000 gordon , raymond g another member of this branch is akatek , with over 50,000 speakers in san miguel acatán and san rafael la independencia yucatec maya ( known simply as '' maya '' to its speakers ) is the most commonly spoken mayan language in mexico subsequently , the guatemalan academy of mayan languages ( known by its spanish acronym almg ) , founded in 1986 , adapted these standards to 22 mayan languages ( primarily in guatemala ) colonial-era literature in mayan languages include the famous popol vuh , a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century classical quiché but believed to be based on an earlier work written in the 1550s , now lost mayan sign language cauque mayan ( mixed language )

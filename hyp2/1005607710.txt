mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called proto-mayan or , in kʼicheʼ maya , nabʼee mayaʼ tzij ( '' the old maya language '' ) the proto-mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the cuchumatanes highlands of central guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where qʼanjobalan is spoken today the earliest proposal was that of which identified the chiapas-guatemalan highlands as the likely '' cradle '' of mayan languages was published by the german antiquarian and scholar karl sapper see attribution in terrence kaufman and john justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-mayan language speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by mamean and quichean people in the archaic period ( before 2000 bce ) , a number of loanwords from mixe–zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-mayan language this has led to hypotheses that the early maya were dominated by speakers of mixe–zoquean languages , possibly the olmec this theory was first proposed by in the case of the xincan and lencan languages , on the other hand , mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords mayan language specialists such as campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between maya and the lencan and xinca people , possibly during the classic period ( 250–900 ) during the classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages the split between proto-yucatecan ( in the north , that is , the yucatán peninsula ) and proto-chʼolan ( in the south , that is , the chiapas highlands and petén basin ) had already occurred by the classic period , when most extant glyphic writing were written both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as '' classic maya language '' during the spanish colonization of central america , all indigenous languages were eclipsed by spanish , which became the new prestige language the use of mayan languages in many important domains of society , including administration , religion and literature , came to an end and perhaps for this reason , many maya communities still retain a high proportion of monolingual speakers the maya area is now dominated by the spanish language while a number of mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered , others remain quite viable , with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society grenoble & whaley ( 1998 ) characterized the situation this way : '' mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers , and a majority of mayas speak a mayan language as a first language rather than being at the end of a process of language shift , mayan languages are writes : '' in the recent maya cultural activism , maintenance of mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified maya identity ' as '' yucatec '' or '' kʼicheʼ '' ; but they also recognize a shared maya kinship fabri writes : '' the term maya is problematic because maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity the academia de lenguas mayas de guatemala ( almg ) finds twenty-one distinct mayan languages '' this pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different mayan languages , some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language following the 1996 peace accords , it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on mayan languages both among mayan scholars and the maya peoples the mayan language family has no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families similarities with some languages of mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into mayan and not to common ancestry examples include linking mayan with the uru–chipaya languages , mapuche , the lencan languages , purépecha and huave in 2015 , campbell noted that recent evidence presented by david mora-marin makes the case for a relationship between mayan and mixe-zoquean languages '' much more plausible '' the mayan family consists of thirty languages typically , these languages are grouped into 5-6 major subgroups ( yucatecan , huastecan , chʼolan–tzeltalan , qʼanjobʼalan , mamean , and kʼichean ) other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between chʼolan and qʼanjobalan–chujean ; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language studies estimate that mayan languages are spoken by more than 6 million people in mexico the mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010 , whereas the belizean speaker population figures around 30,000 the chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the maya area , but today the language with most speakers is chʼol , spoken by 130,000 in chiapas another related language , now endangered , is chʼortiʼ , which is spoken by 30,000 in guatemala it was previously also spoken in the extreme west of honduras and el salvador , but the salvadorian variant is now extinct and the honduran one is considered moribund chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology , and are closely related to the classic maya language found in the central lowlands the famous maya mythological document , popol vuh , is written in an antiquated kʼicheʼ often called classical kʼicheʼ language the kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from guatemala city westward to the northern shore of lake atitlán proto-mayan ( the common ancestor of the mayan languages as reconstructed using the comparative method ) has a predominant cvc syllable structure , only allowing consonant clusters across syllable boundaries the yucatec convention of dz for is retained in maya family names such as dzib mayan sign language cauque mayan ( mixed language )

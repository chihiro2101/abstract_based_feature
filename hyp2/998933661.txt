the concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by franz brentano ( a german philosopher and psychology who is generally regarded as the founder of intentionalism ) franz brentano â€“ britannica.com in his work psychology from an empirical standpoint ( 1874 ) brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena brentano coined the expression '' intentional inexistence '' to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena exists in or has in-existence , existing not externally but in the psychological state '' ( jacquette 2004 , p a major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire , i.e dennett ( see below ) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the '' intentional stance '' however , most philosophers use '' intentionality '' to mean something with no teleological import for philosophers of language , what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning to bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality , husserl followed on brentano , and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention , both in continental and analytic philosophy in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable the effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content , and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing platonist roderick chisholm has revived the brentano thesis through linguistic analysis , distinguishing two parts to brentano 's concept , the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect in current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind , intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference , with both skeptical and supportive adherents a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states on the one hand , it seems that this thought is intentional : that mary is thinking about something relationalist try to solve the problem by interpreting intentional states as relations while adverbialists interpret them as properties it might seem to us and to mary that she is thinking about something but she is not really thinking at all such a position could be motivated by a form of semantic externalism , the view that the meaning of a term , or in this example the content of a thought , is determined by factors external to the subject so if mary perceives a tree , we might say that a perceptual relation holds between mary , the subject of this relation , and the tree , the object of this relation such objects are sometimes called '' proxies '' , '' traces '' , or '' ersatz objects '' so when mary thinks about superman , she is standing in a thinking relation to the abstract object or the platonic form that corresponds to superman in this case , there exists a mental object corresponding to superman in mary 's mind as mary is thinking about superman , she is neither thinking about a platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object adverbialists hold that intentional states are properties of subjects so no independent objects are needed besides the subject , which is how adverbialists avoid the problem of non-existence instead of saying that mary is thinking about superman , it would be more precise , according to adverbialists , to say that mary is thinking in a superman-ly manner or that mary is thinking superman-ly another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem . dennett 's taxonomy of current theories about intentionality daniel dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in chapter 10 of his book intentional stance anscombe ( 1957 ) , peter geach ( 1957 ) , and charles taylor ( 1964 ) all adhere to the former position , namely that intentional idiom is problematic and can not be integrated with the natural sciences members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) the latter position , which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences , is further divided into three standpoints : eliminative materialism , supported by w.v quine ( 1960 ) and churchland ( 1981 ) realism , advocated by jerry fodor ( 1975 ) , as well as burge , dretske , kripke , and the early hilary putnam those who adhere to the quinean double standard this category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality however , exponents of this view are still further divided into those who make an assumption of rationality and those who adhere to the principle of charity intentionalism is the thesis that all mental states are intentional , i.e phenomenal intentionality theory is commonly contrasted with naturalism about intentionality , the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied

the concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by franz brentano ( a german philosopher and psychology who is generally regarded as the founder of intentionalism ) franz brentano â€“ britannica.com in his work psychology from an empirical standpoint ( 1874 ) brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena brentano coined the expression '' intentional inexistence '' to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena according to some interpreters the '' in- '' of '' in-existence '' is to be read as locative , i.e a major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire , i.e for philosophers of language , what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning to bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality , husserl followed on brentano , and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention , both in continental and analytic philosophy in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process , and ayer that describing one 's knowledge is not to describe mental processes the effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content , and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing chisholm 's criteria for the intentional use of sentences are : existence independence , truth-value indifference , and opaque context a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states on the one hand , it seems that this thought is intentional : that mary is thinking about something eliminativists deny that this kind of problematic mental state is possible it might seem to us and to mary that she is thinking about something but she is not really thinking at all such a position could be motivated by a form of semantic externalism , the view that the meaning of a term , or in this example the content of a thought , is determined by factors external to the subject if meaning depends on successful reference then failing to refer would result in a lack of meaning relationalists hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object this is the most natural position for non-problematic cases but one way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of intentionality exceptionalism : that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does n't apply to it so when mary thinks about superman , she is standing in a thinking relation to the abstract object or the platonic form that corresponds to superman a similar solution replaces abstract objects with concrete mental objects as mary is thinking about superman , she is neither thinking about a platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object a related solution sees possible objects as intentional objects so no independent objects are needed besides the subject , which is how adverbialists avoid the problem of non-existence another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem . dennett 's taxonomy of current theories about intentionality daniel dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in chapter 10 of his book intentional stance anscombe ( 1957 ) , peter geach ( 1957 ) , and charles taylor ( 1964 ) all adhere to the former position , namely that intentional idiom is problematic and can not be integrated with the natural sciences proponents of the eliminative materialism , understand intentional idiom , such as '' belief '' , '' desire '' , and the like , to be replaceable either with behavioristic language ( e.g in other words , manuals for translating one language into another can not be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects those who adhere to the so-called quinean double standard ( namely that ontologically there is nothing intentional , but that the language of intentionality is indispensable ) , accept quine 's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation and its implications , while the other positions so far mentioned do not in other words , the behavior ( including speech dispositions ) of any physical system , in theory , could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution intentionalism is entailed by brentano 's claim that intentionality is '' the mark of the mental '' : if all and only mental states are intentional then it is surely the case that all mental states are intentional so the visual perception and the haptic perception agree in both intentional object and intentional content but differ in intentional mode critics of intentionalism , so-called anti-intentionalists , have proposed various apparent counterexamples to intentionalism : states that are considered mental but lack intentionality ( 1972 )

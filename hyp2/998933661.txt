brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena brentano coined the expression '' intentional inexistence '' to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena exists in or has in-existence , existing not externally but in the psychological state '' ( jacquette 2004 , p however , most philosophers use '' intentionality '' to mean something with no teleological import to bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality , husserl followed on brentano , and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention , both in continental and analytic philosophy in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable ayer were critical of husserl 's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness the effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content , and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing platonist roderick chisholm has revived the brentano thesis through linguistic analysis , distinguishing two parts to brentano 's concept , the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect in current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind , intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference , with both skeptical and supportive adherents john searle argued for this position with the chinese room thought experiment , according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states this is particularly relevant for cases involving objects that have no existence outside the mind , as in the case of mere fantasies or hallucinations on the one hand , it seems that this thought is intentional : that mary is thinking about something this suggests that mary is either not thinking about something or that mary is thinking about something that does n't exist various theories have been proposed in order to reconcile these conflicting intuitions it might seem to us and to mary that she is thinking about something but she is not really thinking at all the difficulty for such a position is to explain why it seems to mary that she is thinking about something and how seeming to think is different from actual thinking relationalists hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object this principle rules out that we can bear relations to non-existing entities but one way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of intentionality exceptionalism : that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does n't apply to it a more common relationalist solution is to look for existing objects that can play the role that the non-existing object was supposed to play a similar solution replaces abstract objects with concrete mental objects in this case , there exists a mental object corresponding to superman in mary 's mind as mary is thinking about superman , she is neither thinking about a platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object adverbialists hold that intentional states are properties of subjects most , if not all , current theories on intentionality accept brentano 's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom anscombe ( 1957 ) , peter geach ( 1957 ) , and charles taylor ( 1964 ) all adhere to the former position , namely that intentional idiom is problematic and can not be integrated with the natural sciences members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) in other words , manuals for translating one language into another can not be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects famously , fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought dennett comments on this issue , fodor '' attempts to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them ( somehow ) in the 'syntax ' of a system of physically realized mental representations '' ( dennett 1987 , 345 ) dennett ( 1969 , 1971 , 1975 ) , cherniak ( 1981 , 1986 ) , and the more recent work of putnam ( 1983 ) recommend the assumption of rationality , which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational critics of intentionalism , so-called anti-intentionalists , have proposed various apparent counterexamples to intentionalism : states that are considered mental but lack intentionality ) another form of anti-intentionalism associated with john searle regards phenomenality itself as the '' mark of the mental '' and sidelines intentionality in the moderate version , phenomenal intentionality is privileged because other types of intentionality depend on it or are grounded in it phenomenal intentionality theory is commonly contrasted with naturalism about intentionality , the view that intentional properties are

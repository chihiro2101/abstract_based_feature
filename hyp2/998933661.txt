the concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by franz brentano ( a german philosopher and psychology who is generally regarded as the founder of intentionalism ) franz brentano â€“ britannica.com in his work psychology from an empirical standpoint ( 1874 ) brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena brentano coined the expression '' intentional inexistence '' to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena a major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire , i.e dennett ( see below ) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the '' intentional stance '' however , most philosophers use '' intentionality '' to mean something with no teleological import for philosophers of language , what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning to bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality , husserl followed on brentano , and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention , both in continental and analytic philosophy in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable german philosopher martin heidegger ( being and time ) , defined intentionality as '' care '' ( sorge ) , a sentient condition where an individual 's existence , facticity , and being in the world identifies their ontological significance , in contrast to that which is merely ontic ( '' thinghood '' ) ayer were critical of husserl 's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process , and ayer that describing one 's knowledge is not to describe mental processes platonist roderick chisholm has revived the brentano thesis through linguistic analysis , distinguishing two parts to brentano 's concept , the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect in current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind , intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference , with both skeptical and supportive adherents a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states it might seem to us and to mary that she is thinking about something but she is not really thinking at all such a position could be motivated by a form of semantic externalism , the view that the meaning of a term , or in this example the content of a thought , is determined by factors external to the subject the difficulty for such a position is to explain why it seems to mary that she is thinking about something and how seeming to think is different from actual thinking relationalists hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object so when mary thinks about superman , she is standing in a thinking relation to the abstract object or the platonic form that corresponds to superman a similar solution replaces abstract objects with concrete mental objects a related solution sees possible objects as intentional objects adverbialists hold that intentional states are properties of subjects this approach has been termed '' adverbialism '' since the object of the intentional state is seen as a modification of this state , which can be linguistically expressed through adverbs another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem daniel dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in chapter 10 of his book intentional stance most , if not all , current theories on intentionality accept brentano 's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) proponents of the eliminative materialism , understand intentional idiom , such as '' belief '' , '' desire '' , and the like , to be replaceable either with behavioristic language ( e.g those who adhere to the so-called quinean double standard ( namely that ontologically there is nothing intentional , but that the language of intentionality is indispensable ) , accept quine 's thesis of the indeterminacy of translation and its implications , while the other positions so far mentioned do not this category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality working on the intentionality of vision , belief , and knowledge , pierre le morvan ( 2005 ) has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs '' transparent '' , '' translucent '' , and '' opaque '' respectively tim crane , himself an impure intentionalist , explains this difference by distinguishing three aspects of intentional states : the intentional object , the intentional content , and the intentional mode for example , seeing that an apple is round and tasting that this apple is sweet both have the same intentional object : the apple critics of intentionalism , so-called anti-intentionalists , have proposed various apparent counterexamples to intentionalism : states that are considered mental but lack intentionality phenomenal intentionality theory is commonly contrasted with naturalism about intentionality , the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied by the natural sciences '' the intentionality of consciousness and

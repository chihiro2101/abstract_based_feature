the concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by franz brentano ( a german philosopher and psychology who is generally regarded as the founder of intentionalism ) franz brentano â€“ britannica.com in his work psychology from an empirical standpoint ( 1874 ) brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena brentano coined the expression '' intentional inexistence '' to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena a major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire , i.e dennett ( see below ) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the '' intentional stance '' for philosophers of language , what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable german philosopher martin heidegger ( being and time ) , defined intentionality as '' care '' ( sorge ) , a sentient condition where an individual 's existence , facticity , and being in the world identifies their ontological significance , in contrast to that which is merely ontic ( '' thinghood '' ) ayer were critical of husserl 's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process , and ayer that describing one 's knowledge is not to describe mental processes ( sartre also referred to '' consciousness '' as '' nothing '' ) chisholm 's criteria for the intentional use of sentences are : existence independence , truth-value indifference , and opaque context in current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind , intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference , with both skeptical and supportive adherents a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states on the one hand , it seems that this thought is intentional : that mary is thinking about something this suggests that mary is either not thinking about something or that mary is thinking about something that does n't exist relationalists hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object relations are usually assumed to be existence-entailing : the instance of a relation entails the existence of its relata but one way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of intentionality exceptionalism : that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does n't apply to it abstract objects have actual existence but they exist outside space and time as mary is thinking about superman , she is neither thinking about a platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object so no independent objects are needed besides the subject , which is how adverbialists avoid the problem of non-existence instead of saying that mary is thinking about superman , it would be more precise , according to adverbialists , to say that mary is thinking in a superman-ly manner or that mary is thinking superman-ly another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem daniel dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in chapter 10 of his book intentional stance anscombe ( 1957 ) , peter geach ( 1957 ) , and charles taylor ( 1964 ) all adhere to the former position , namely that intentional idiom is problematic and can not be integrated with the natural sciences members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) the latter position , which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences , is further divided into three standpoints : eliminative materialism , supported by w.v proponents of the eliminative materialism , understand intentional idiom , such as '' belief '' , '' desire '' , and the like , to be replaceable either with behavioristic language ( e.g holders of realism argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution in other words , manuals for translating one language into another can not be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects famously , fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought dennett comments on this issue , fodor '' attempts to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them ( somehow ) in the 'syntax ' of a system of physically realized mental representations '' ( dennett 1987 , 345 ) dennett , for example , argues in true believers ( 1981 ) that intentional idiom ( or '' folk psychology '' ) is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system , then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it let 's call the '' intendum '' what an intentional state is about , and the '' intender '' the subject who is in the intentional state intentionalism is entailed by brentano 's claim that intentionality is '' the mark of the mental '' : if all and only mental states are intentional then it is surely the case that all mental states are intentional phenomenal intentionality theory is commonly contrasted with naturalism about intentionality , the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied by

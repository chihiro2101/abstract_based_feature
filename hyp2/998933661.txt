the concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by franz brentano ( a german philosopher and psychology who is generally regarded as the founder of intentionalism ) franz brentano â€“ britannica.com in his work psychology from an empirical standpoint ( 1874 ) brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus '' psychical '' or '' mental '' phenomena , by which they may be set apart from '' physical '' or '' natural '' phenomena brentano coined the expression '' intentional inexistence '' to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena exists in or has in-existence , existing not externally but in the psychological state '' ( jacquette 2004 , p was intended to carry any ontological commitment '' ( chrudzimski and smith 2004 , p however , most philosophers use '' intentionality '' to mean something with no teleological import for philosophers of language , what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning this lack of clarity may underpin some of the differences of view indicated below in contrast to brentano 's view , french philosopher jean-paul sartre ( being and nothingness ) identified intentionality with consciousness , stating that the two were indistinguishable ayer were critical of husserl 's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness the effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content , and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing in current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind , intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference , with both skeptical and supportive adherents . the problem of intentional inexistence a central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of intentional inexistence : to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states this is particularly relevant for cases involving objects that have no existence outside the mind , as in the case of mere fantasies or hallucinations on the one hand , it seems that this thought is intentional : that mary is thinking about something this suggests that mary is either not thinking about something or that mary is thinking about something that does n't exist if meaning depends on successful reference then failing to refer would result in a lack of meaning relationalists hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object but one way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of intentionality exceptionalism : that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does n't apply to it it has been suggested that abstract objects or platonic forms can play this role abstract objects have actual existence but they exist outside space and time a similar solution replaces abstract objects with concrete mental objects one problem for both of these theories is that they seem to mischaracterize the experience of thinking as mary is thinking about superman , she is neither thinking about a platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object this involves a commitment to modal realism , for example in the form of the lewisian model or as envisioned by takashi yagisawa so no independent objects are needed besides the subject , which is how adverbialists avoid the problem of non-existence another objection is that , by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states , adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents , the so-called many-property-problem most , if not all , current theories on intentionality accept brentano 's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom anscombe ( 1957 ) , peter geach ( 1957 ) , and charles taylor ( 1964 ) all adhere to the former position , namely that intentional idiom is problematic and can not be integrated with the natural sciences members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects , which may imply some kind of dualism ( though this is debatable ) the latter position , which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences , is further divided into three standpoints : eliminative materialism , supported by w.v quine ( 1960 ) and churchland ( 1981 ) realism , advocated by jerry fodor ( 1975 ) , as well as burge , dretske , kripke , and the early hilary putnam those who adhere to the quinean double standard intentionalism is entailed by brentano 's claim that intentionality is '' the mark of the mental '' : if all and only mental states are intentional then it is surely the case that all mental states are intentional . mental states without intentionality a further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional , although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them phenomenal intentionality is the type of intentionality grounded in phenomenal or conscious mental states '' the intentionality of consciousness and consciousness of intentionality

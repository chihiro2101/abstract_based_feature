the concept of virtual particles arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory , an approximation scheme in which interactions ( in essence , forces ) between actual particles are calculated in terms of exchanges of virtual particles such calculations are often performed using schematic representations known as feynman diagrams , in which virtual particles appear as internal lines by expressing the interaction in terms of the exchange of a virtual particle with four-momentum , where is given by the difference between the four-momenta of the particles entering and leaving the interaction vertex , both momentum and energy are conserved at the interaction vertices of the feynman diagram a virtual particle does not precisely obey the energyâ€“momentum relation most of these have analogous effects in solid-state physics ; indeed , one can often gain a better intuitive understanding by examining these cases a virtual particle is in a virtual state where the probability amplitude is not conserved the calculation of scattering amplitudes in theoretical particle physics requires the use of some rather large and complicated integrals over a large number of variables thus , it is natural to associate the other lines in the diagram with particles as well , called the '' virtual particles '' in the adjacent image , the solid lines correspond to actual particles ( of momentum p 1 and so on ) , while the dotted line corresponds to a virtual particle carrying momentum k since these particles do not have a permanent existence , they are called virtual particles or vacuum fluctuations of vacuum energy

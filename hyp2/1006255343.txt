the concept of virtual particles arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory , an approximation scheme in which interactions ( in essence , forces ) between actual particles are calculated in terms of exchanges of virtual particles such calculations are often performed using schematic representations known as feynman diagrams , in which virtual particles appear as internal lines by expressing the interaction in terms of the exchange of a virtual particle with four-momentum , where is given by the difference between the four-momenta of the particles entering and leaving the interaction vertex , both momentum and energy are conserved at the interaction vertices of the feynman diagram a virtual particle is in a virtual state where the probability amplitude is not conserved in the adjacent image , the solid lines correspond to actual particles ( of momentum p 1 and so on ) , while the dotted line corresponds to a virtual particle carrying momentum k in formal terms , a particle is considered to be an eigenstate of the particle number operator a † a , where a is the particle annihilation operator and a † the particle creation operator ( sometimes collectively called ladder operators ) since these particles do not have a permanent existence , they are called virtual particles or vacuum fluctuations of vacuum energy virtual particles are often popularly described as coming in pairs , a particle and antiparticle which can be of any kind for this reason , virtual particles & ndash ; which exist only temporarily as they are exchanged between ordinary particles & ndash ; do not typically obey the mass-shell relation ; the longer a virtual particle exists , the more the energy and momentum approach the mass-shell relation

indigenous illyrian kingdom emerged with its capital at shkodër as roman power declined , this part of the dalmatia suffered from intermittent ravages by various semi-nomadic invaders , especially the goths in the late 5th century and the avars during the 6th century because the terrain was extremely rugged and lacked any major sources of wealth such as mineral riches , the area that is now montenegro became a haven for residual groups of earlier settlers , including some tribes who had escaped romanisation in the second half of the 6th century , slavs migrated from the bay of kotor to the river of bojana and the hinterland of it as well as surround the skadar lake under the following missions of cyril and methodus , the population was christianised the slavic tribes organised into a semi-independent dukedom of duklja ( doclea ) by the 9th century prince časlav klonimirović of the serbian vlastimirović dynasty extended his influence over doclea in the 10th century after the fall of the serbian realm in 960 , the docleans faced a renewed byzantine occupation through to the 11th century later on mihailo sent his troops , led by his son bodin , in 1072 to assist the uprising of slavs in macedonia the expansions of the kings of the vojislavljević dynasty led to the control over the other slavic lands , including zahumlje , bosnia and rascia the might of the doclea declined and they generally became subjected to the grand princes of rascia in the 12th century stefan nemanja was born in 1117 in ribnica ( today podgorica ) the region of duklja ( zeta ) was ruled by the nemanjić dynasty from c the principality of zeta was ruled by the house of crnojević dynasty from c after the dramatic fall of the western roman empire ( 476 ) , the romanised illyrians of the coast of dalmatia survived the barbarian invasions of the avars in the 6th century and were only nominally under the influence of the slavs in the 7th and 8th centuries venice started to take control of the southern dalmatia around the 10th century , quickly assimilating the dalmatian language with venetian by the 14th century the republic of venice was able to create a territorial continuity around the bay of kotor ( cattaro ) clans were ruled by chieftains , who also were military leaders of a clan independent montenegro of that time was divided into three parts : old montenegro , which included the territory of the modern-day town of cetinje and part of danilovgrad montenegrin prince-bishops ( vladikas ) lived and ruled from cetinje this area was also known as '' the seven hills '' ( sedam brda ) because it was inhabited by seven montenegrin clans : vasojevići , bjelopavlići , piperi , kuči , bratonožići , morača and rovca the clans were led by vojvodas ( dukes ) , either elective or hereditary ones for 180 years after their first appointment , the vladikas were elected by the clans and people — an arrangement which was ultimately abandoned in favour of the hereditary system in 1696 a pretender to montenegrin throne , one of the crnojević family who had converted to islam , invaded montenegro just as staniša , thirty years before , and with the same result vukotić , the civil governor , repulsed the attack of turks the national historians are silent upon the subject of the haraç ( tax in ottoman empire ) , which the invaders are said to have exacted from the inhabitants of the free mountains others were killed by montenegrin pursuers much light is thrown upon the condition of montenegro at this period and the causes of its invariable success in war even against fearful odds are explained by the accounts of a contemporary writer , mariano bolizza at the time , the whole male population of cetinje available for war consisted of 8,027 persons , distributed among ninety-three villages each nahia was divided into tribes , or plemena , each presided over by a headman or kniez , who acted as a judge in disputes between the clansmen the serbia joined montenegro , but it was defeated by turkish forces that same year russia now joined in and decisively routed the turks in 1877–78 the treaty of san stefano ( march 1878 ) was highly advantageous to montenegro , as well as russia , serbia , romania and bulgaria under nicholas i the country was also granted its first constitution ( 1905 ) and was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1910 in the balkan wars ( 1912–1913 ) , montenegro did make further territorial gains by splitting sanjak with serbia montenegro suffered severely in world war i for purposes of coordination in the fight against the enemy army , serbian general bozidar jankovic was named head of high command of both serbian and montenegrin armies lack of vital materials eventually led montenegro to surrender austria-hungary dispatched a separate army to invade montenegro and to prevent a junction of the serbian and montenegrin armies this force , however , was repulsed , and from the top of the strongly fortified lovćen , the montenegrins carried on the bombardment of kotor held by the enemy the austro-hungarian army managed to capture the town of pljevlja while on the other hand the montenegrins took budva , then under austrian control the dominant political parties in montenegro were democratic party , people 's radical party , communist party of yugoslavia , alliance of agrarians , montenegrin federalist party and yugoslav republican party all of the parties except federalists had the same attitude towards the first question , favouring centralism to federalism josip broz tito

within montenegro , and in 1947 the seat of the republic was moved to the city , now named titograd in honor to marshal tito during the war montenegro was bombed as part of nato operations against

substantial greek colonies were established on the 6th and 7th centuries bc and celts are known to have settled there in the 4th century bc during the 3rd century bc , an indigenous illyrian kingdom emerged with its capital at shkodër the romans mounted several punitive expeditions against local pirates and finally conquered this illyrian kingdom in the 2nd century bc , annexing it to the province of illyricum as roman power declined , this part of the dalmatia suffered from intermittent ravages by various semi-nomadic invaders , especially the goths in the late 5th century and the avars during the 6th century because the terrain was extremely rugged and lacked any major sources of wealth such as mineral riches , the area that is now montenegro became a haven for residual groups of earlier settlers , including some tribes who had escaped romanisation in the second half of the 6th century , slavs migrated from the bay of kotor to the river of bojana and the hinterland of it as well as surround the skadar lake the slavic tribes organised into a semi-independent dukedom of duklja ( doclea ) by the 9th century prince časlav klonimirović of the serbian vlastimirović dynasty extended his influence over doclea in the 10th century stefan vojislav started an uprising against the byzantine domination and gained a huge victory against the army of several byzantine strategs in tudjemili ( bar ) in 1042 , which put to an end the byzantine influence over the doclea in 1077 , pope gregory vii recognised duklja as an independent state , acknowledging its king mihailo ( michael , of the vojislavljević dynasty founded by nobleman stefan vojislav ) as rex doclea ( king of duklja ) in 1082 , after numerous pleas the bar bishopric of bar was upgraded to an archbishopric the expansions of the kings of the vojislavljević dynasty led to the control over the other slavic lands , including zahumlje , bosnia and rascia the might of the doclea declined and they generally became subjected to the grand princes of rascia in the 12th century stefan nemanja was born in 1117 in ribnica ( today podgorica ) in 1168 , as the serbian grand zhupan , stefan nemanja took doclea the region of duklja ( zeta ) was ruled by the nemanjić dynasty from c the principality of zeta was ruled by the house of balšić from c after the dramatic fall of the western roman empire ( 476 ) , the romanised illyrians of the coast of dalmatia survived the barbarian invasions of the avars in the 6th century and were only nominally under the influence of the slavs in the 7th and 8th centuries venice started to take control of the southern dalmatia around the 10th century , quickly assimilating the dalmatian language with venetian in those four centuries the area around the cattaro ( kotor ) became part of venetian albania only small town centers were controlled by ottomans , but mountains and rural area were de facto independent and controlled by several montenegrin clans , which were warrior societies all clan leaders met up several times a year at a zbor ( assembly ) in cetinje , the montenegrin capital , to make important decisions for the nation , to solve blood feuds , and to declare wars independent montenegro of that time was divided into three parts : old montenegro , which included the territory of the modern-day town of cetinje and part of danilovgrad this area was also known as '' the seven hills '' ( sedam brda ) because it was inhabited by seven montenegrin clans : vasojevići , bjelopavlići , piperi , kuči , bratonožići , morača and rovca vladika vavil was elected in 1516 as montenegrin prince-bishop by the montenegrin people for 180 years after their first appointment , the vladikas were elected by the clans and people — an arrangement which was ultimately abandoned in favour of the hereditary system in 1696 the next ottoman invasion of montenegro took place in 1570 the national historians are silent upon the subject of the haraç ( tax in ottoman empire ) , which the invaders are said to have exacted from the inhabitants of the free mountains about 1500 montenegrin warriors attacked the turkish camp on lješkopolje field during the night , which counted 10.000 ottoman soldiers ottoman soldiers were twice as numerous as whole population of old montenegro on 10 september the montenegrins met the turkish army , on the same spot skenderbeg crnojević was defeated nearly a century ago the montenegrins , although assisted by some neighbouring tribes , counted 4000 and were completely outnumbered much light is thrown upon the condition of montenegro at this period and the causes of its invariable success in war even against fearful odds are explained by the accounts of a contemporary writer , mariano bolizza this author , a patrician of venice , residing at kotor in the early part of the seventeenth century , spent a considerable time in the old montenegro , and published in 1614 a description of cetinje still , there was a system of local government each nahia was divided into tribes , or plemena , each presided over by a headman or kniez , who acted as a judge in disputes between the clansmen a short history of yugoslavia from earliest times to 1966 austria-hungary dispatched a separate army to invade montenegro and to prevent a junction of the serbian and montenegrin armies this force , however , was repulsed , and from the top of the strongly fortified lovćen , the montenegrins carried on the bombardment of kotor held by the enemy the serbian victory at the battle of cer ( 15–24 august 1914 ) diverted enemy forces from sandžak , and pljevlja came into montenegrin hands again on august 10 , 1914 , the montenegrin infantry delivered a strong attack against the austrian garrisons , but they did not succeed in making good the advantage they first gained however , the serbian army survived , and led by king peter i of serbia , started retreating across albania see serbian campaign ( world war i ) for details a newly convened podgorica assembly , accused the кing of seeking a separate peace with the enemy and consequently deposed him , banned his return and decided that montenegro should join the kingdom of serbia on december 1 , 1918 the breakup of yugoslavia ( 1991–1992 ) and the introduction of a multi-party system found montenegro with a young leadership that had risen to office only a few years earlier in the late 1980s it allowed them to win the first multi-party parliamentary election held on 9 and 16 december 1990 , and presidential elections held on 9 and 23 december 1990 this distance from the policies of milošević played a role in sparing montenegro from the heavy bombing that serbia endured in the spring of 1999 during the nato air-campaign the state union had a parliament and an army in common , and for three years ( until 2006 ) , neither serbia nor montenegro held a referendum on the break-up of the union demographic history of montenegro

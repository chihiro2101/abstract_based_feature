indigenous illyrian kingdom emerged with its capital at shkodër the romans mounted several punitive expeditions against local pirates and finally conquered this illyrian kingdom in the 2nd century bc , annexing it to the province of illyricum as roman power declined , this part of the dalmatia suffered from intermittent ravages by various semi-nomadic invaders , especially the goths in the late 5th century and the avars during the 6th century these soon were supplanted by the slavs , who became widely established in dalmatia by the middle of the 7th century because the terrain was extremely rugged and lacked any major sources of wealth such as mineral riches , the area that is now montenegro became a haven for residual groups of earlier settlers , including some tribes who had escaped romanisation in the second half of the 6th century , slavs migrated from the bay of kotor to the river of bojana and the hinterland of it as well as surround the skadar lake the slavic tribes organised into a semi-independent dukedom of duklja ( doclea ) by the 9th century after facing subsequent bulgarian domination , the people were split as the doclean brother-archonts split the lands among each other after 900 prince časlav klonimirović of the serbian vlastimirović dynasty extended his influence over doclea in the 10th century the might of the doclea declined and they generally became subjected to the grand princes of rascia in the 12th century in 1168 , as the serbian grand zhupan , stefan nemanja took doclea the region of duklja ( zeta ) was ruled by the nemanjić dynasty from c after the death of balša iii , last representative of house of balšić , zeta joined the serbian despotate in 1421 after the dramatic fall of the western roman empire ( 476 ) , the romanised

centuries of the first millennium , these romanised illyrians started to develop their own neo-latin language , called dalmatian language , around their small coastal villages that were growing with maritime commerce venice started to take control of the southern dalmatia around the 10th century , quickly assimilating the dalmatian language with venetian only small town centers were controlled by ottomans , but mountains and rural area were de facto independent and controlled by several montenegrin clans , which were warrior societies clans were ruled by chieftains , who also were military leaders of a clan all clan leaders met up several times a year at a zbor ( assembly ) in cetinje , the montenegrin capital , to make important decisions for the nation , to solve blood feuds , and to declare wars independent montenegro of that time was divided into three parts : old montenegro , which included the territory of the modern-day town of cetinje and part of danilovgrad this area was also known as '' the seven hills '' ( sedam brda ) because it was inhabited by seven montenegrin clans : vasojevići , bjelopavlići , piperi , kuči , bratonožići , morača and rovca old herzegovina , an

second-in-command and a hundred other turkish officers were carried off and stuck on the ramparts of cetinje much light is thrown upon the condition of montenegro at this period and the causes of its invariable success in war even against fearful odds are explained by the accounts of a contemporary writer , mariano bolizza at the time , the whole male population of cetinje available for war consisted of 8,027 persons , distributed among ninety-three villages war was the chief occupation of its inhabitants from sheer necessity , and the arts of peace languished the serbia joined

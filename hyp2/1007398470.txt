though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages this leads some librarians to superstitious and cult-like behaviors , such as the '' purifiers '' , who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the '' crimson hexagon '' and its illustrated , magical books others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him in his book the race with the tortoise ( berlin , 1919 ) , dr theodor wolff suggests that it is a derivation from , or a parody of , ram√≥n llull 's thinking machine there is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in '' the library of babel '' , although borges had mentioned that analogy in '' the total library '' : '' a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would , in a few eternities , produce all the books in the british museum '' borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story , '' the book of sand '' in which there is an infinite book ( or book with an indefinite number of pages ) rather than an infinite library the concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a sphere having its center everywhere and its circumference nowhere every book in the library is '' intelligible '' if one decodes it correctly , simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad on a psychological level , the infinite storehouse of information is a hindrance and a distraction , because it lures one away from writing one 's own book ( i.e borges ' narrator notes this fact , but believes that the library is nevertheless infinite ; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically , giving an eventual '' order '' to the '' disorder '' of the seemingly random arrangement of books quine noted the interesting fact that the library of babel is finite ( that is , we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written ) , and that any text that does n't fit in a single book can be reconstructed by finding a second book ( which is guaranteed to exist ) with the continuation daniel dennett 's 1995 book darwin 's dangerous idea includes an elaboration of the library of babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences , which he calls the library of mendel , in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation russell standish 's theory of nothing uses the concept of the library of babel to illustrate how an ultimate ensemble containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe the unimaginable mathematics of borges ' library of babel ( 2008 ) by william goldbloom bloch explores the short story from a mathematical perspective peck wrote a novella entitled a short stay in hell ( 2012 ) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of borges ' library of babel each book is marked by a coordinate , corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library ( hexagon name , wall number , shelf number , and book name ) so that every book can be found at the same place every time gene wolfe 's the shadow of the torturer features an impossibly large , labyrinthine library , the caretaker of which is a blind man , in direct homage to borges and his work

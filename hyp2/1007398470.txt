though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages conversely , for many of the texts , some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents this leads some librarians to superstitious and cult-like behaviors , such as the '' purifiers '' , who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the '' crimson hexagon '' and its illustrated , magical books others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him many of borges ' signature motifs are featured in the story , including infinity , reality , kabbalah , and labyrinths the concept of the library is often compared to infinite monkey theorem there is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in '' the library of babel '' , although borges had mentioned that analogy in '' the total library '' : '' a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would , in a few eternities , produce all the books in the british museum '' borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story , '' the book of sand '' in which there is an infinite book ( or book with an indefinite number of pages ) rather than an infinite library the mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal employed this metaphor , and in an earlier essay borges noted that pascal 's manuscript called the sphere effroyable , or '' frightful '' every book in the library is '' intelligible '' if one decodes it correctly , simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad the library becomes a temptation , even an obsession , because it contains these gems of enlightenment while also burying them in deception russell standish 's theory of nothing uses the concept of the library of babel to illustrate how an ultimate ensemble containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe michael ende reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the temple of a thousand doors from the neverending story , which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm in greg bear 's novel city at the end of time ( 2008 ) , the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'babel ' , an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language peck wrote a novella entitled a short stay in hell ( 2012 ) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of borges ' library of babel this scene has been compared to the library of babel , and nolan cites borges as an artistic influence gene wolfe 's the shadow of the torturer features an impossibly large , labyrinthine library , the caretaker of which is a blind man , in direct homage to borges and his work

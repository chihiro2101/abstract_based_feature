though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages this leads some librarians to superstitious and cult-like behaviors , such as the '' purifiers '' , who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the '' crimson hexagon '' and its illustrated , magical books others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him in his book the race with the tortoise ( berlin , 1919 ) , dr theodor wolff suggests that it is a derivation from , or a parody of , ram√≥n llull 's thinking machine lasswitz urges mankind to construct that inhuman library , which chance would organize and which would eliminate intelligence there is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in '' the library of babel '' , although borges had mentioned that analogy in '' the total library '' : '' a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would , in a few eternities , produce all the books in the british museum '' borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story , '' the book of sand '' in which there is an infinite book ( or book with an indefinite number of pages ) rather than an infinite library in the library of babel , borges interpolates italian mathematician bonaventura cavalieri 's suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes the concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a sphere having its center everywhere and its circumference nowhere every book in the library is '' intelligible '' if one decodes it correctly , simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad borges ' narrator notes this fact , but believes that the library is nevertheless infinite ; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically , giving an eventual '' order '' to the '' disorder '' of the seemingly random arrangement of books the size of the alphabet can be reduced by using , say , morse code , even though it makes the books more verbose ; the size of the books can also be reduced by splitting each into multiple volumes and discarding the duplicates the full possible set of protein sequences ( protein sequence space ) has been compared to the library of babel he describes the library of mendel and the library of toshiba as subsets within the library of babel in greg bear 's novel city at the end of time ( 2008 ) , the sum-runners carried by the protagonists are intended by their creator to be combined to form a 'babel ' , an infinite library containing every possible permutation of every possible character in every possible language peck wrote a novella entitled a short stay in hell ( 2012 ) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of borges ' library of babel the library of babel , a website created by jonathan basile , emulates an english-language version of borges ' library

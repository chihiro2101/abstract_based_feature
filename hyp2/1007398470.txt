borges ' narrator describes how his universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent hexagonal rooms though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages conversely , for many of the texts , some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him the totality of such variations would form a total library of astronomical size there is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in '' the library of babel '' , although borges had mentioned that analogy in '' the total library '' : '' a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would , in a few eternities , produce all the books in the british museum in the library of babel , borges interpolates italian mathematician bonaventura cavalieri 's suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes every book in the library is '' intelligible '' if one decodes it correctly , simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad this lends itself to the philosophical idea proposed by immanuel kant , that our mind helps to structure our experience of reality ; thus the rules of reality ( as we know it ) are intrinsic to the mind one can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write writes quine , '' the ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face : a universal library of two volumes , one containing a single dot and the other a dash in the library of babel , finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his toshiba computer , which he calls the library of toshiba michael ende reused the idea of a universe of hexagonal rooms in the temple of a thousand doors from the neverending story , which contained all the possible characteristics of doors in the fantastic realm as the parallel universe collapses , darkness falls , and a character perishes in the void after uttering the words , '' o time thy pyramids , '' which are contained on the second-to-last page of a book in the library of babel each book is marked by a coordinate , corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library ( hexagon name , wall number , shelf number , and book name ) so that every book can be found at the same place every time gene wolfe 's the shadow of the torturer features an impossibly large , labyrinthine library , the caretaker of which is a blind man , in direct homage to borges and his work

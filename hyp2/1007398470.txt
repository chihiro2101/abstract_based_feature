though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless , the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic grapheme ( 22 letters , the period , the comma , and space ) though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish , the library also must contain , somewhere , every coherent book ever written , or that might ever be written , and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books the narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information , including predictions of the future , biographies of any person , and translations of every book in all languages conversely , for many of the texts , some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents this leads some librarians to superstitious and cult-like behaviors , such as the '' purifiers '' , who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the '' crimson hexagon '' and its illustrated , magical books others believe that since all books exist in the library , somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library 's contents ; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the '' man of the book '' has read it , and they travel through the library seeking him the story repeats the theme of borges ' 1939 essay '' the total library '' ( '' la biblioteca total '' ) , which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by kurd lasswitz in his 1901 story '' the universal library '' ( '' die universalbibliothek '' ) : certain examples that aristotle attributes to democritus and leucippus clearly prefigure it , but its belated inventor is gustav theodor fechner , and its first exponent , kurd lasswitz there is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in '' the library of babel '' , although borges had mentioned that analogy in '' the total library '' : '' a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would , in a few eternities , produce all the books in the british museum '' borges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story , '' the book of sand '' in which there is an infinite book ( or book with an indefinite number of pages ) rather than an infinite library in the library of babel , borges interpolates italian mathematician bonaventura cavalieri 's suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes every book in the library is '' intelligible '' if one decodes it correctly , simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad one can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the existence of god , as it is carried out by david hume using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind , but by nature borges ' narrator notes this fact , but believes that the library is nevertheless infinite ; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically , giving an eventual '' order '' to the '' disorder '' of the seemingly random arrangement of books quine noted the interesting fact that the library of babel is finite ( that is , we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written ) , and that any text that does n't fit in a single book can be reconstructed by finding a second book ( which is guaranteed to exist ) with the continuation russell standish 's theory of nothing uses the concept of the library of babel to illustrate how an ultimate ensemble containing all possible descriptions would in sum contain zero information and would thus be the simplest possible explanation for the existence of the universe peck wrote a novella entitled a short stay in hell ( 2012 ) in which the protagonist must find the book containing his life story in an afterlife replica of borges ' library of babel this scene has been compared to the library of babel , and nolan cites borges as an artistic influence each book is marked by a coordinate , corresponding to its place on the hexagonal library ( hexagon name , wall number , shelf number , and book name ) so that every book can be found at the same place every time

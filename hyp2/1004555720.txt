hyper-threading technology is a form of simultaneous multithreading technology introduced by intel , while the concept behind the technology has been patented by sun microsystems architecturally , a processor with hyper-threading technology consists of two logical processors per core , each of which has its own processor architectural state each logical processor can be individually halted , interrupted or directed to execute a specified thread , independently from the other logical processor sharing the same physical core unlike a traditional dual-processor configuration that uses two separate physical processors , the logical processors in a hyper-threaded core share the execution resources these resources include the execution engine , caches , and system bus interface ; the sharing of resources allows two logical processors to work with each other more efficiently , and allows a logical processor to borrow resources from a stalled logical core ( assuming both logical cores are associated with the same physical core ) the degree of benefit seen when using a hyper-threaded or multi core processor depends on the needs of the software , and how well it and the operating system are written to manage the processor efficiently this allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as the usual '' physical '' processor and an extra '' logical '' processor to the host operating system ( htt-unaware operating systems see two '' physical '' processors ) , allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously and appropriately when execution resources would not be used by the current task in a processor without hyper-threading , and especially when the processor is stalled , a hyper-threading equipped processor can use those execution resources to execute another scheduled task the minimum that is required to take advantage of hyper-threading is symmetric multiprocessing ( smp ) support in the operating system , as the logical processors appear as standard separate processors if the operating system 's thread scheduler is unaware of hyper-threading , it will treat all four logical processors the same according to intel , the first hyper-threading implementation used only 5 % more die area than the comparable non-hyperthreaded processor , but the performance was 15â€“30 % better this is due to the replay system of the pentium & nbsp ; 4 tying up valuable execution resources , equalizing the processor resources between the two programs , which adds a varying amount of execution time according to a november 2009 analysis by intel , performance impacts of hyper-threading result in increased overall latency in case the execution of threads does not result in significant overall throughput gains , which vary by the application

hyper-threading technology is a form of simultaneous multithreading technology introduced by intel , while the concept behind the technology has been patented by sun microsystems architecturally , a processor with hyper-threading technology consists of two logical processors per core , each of which has its own processor architectural state each logical processor can be individually halted , interrupted or directed to execute a specified thread , independently from the other logical processor sharing the same physical core unlike a traditional dual-processor configuration that uses two separate physical processors , the logical processors in a hyper-threaded core share the execution resources these resources include the execution engine , caches , and system bus interface ; the sharing of resources allows two logical processors to work with each other more efficiently , and allows a logical processor to borrow resources from a stalled logical core ( assuming both logical cores are associated with the same physical core ) hyper-threading works by duplicating certain sections of the processor—those that store the architectural state—but not duplicating the main execution unit this allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as the usual '' physical '' processor and an extra '' logical '' processor to the host operating system ( htt-unaware operating systems see two '' physical '' processors ) , allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously and appropriately the minimum that is required to take advantage of hyper-threading is symmetric multiprocessing ( smp ) support in the operating system , as the logical processors appear as standard separate processors if the operating system 's thread scheduler is unaware of hyper-threading , it will treat all four logical processors the same it was also included on the 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz northwood-based pentium & nbsp ; 4 in the same year , and then remained as a feature in every pentium & nbsp ; 4 & nbsp ; ht , pentium & nbsp ; 4 extreme edition and pentium extreme edition processor since the itanium & nbsp ; 9300 launched with eight threads per processor ( two threads per core ) through enhanced hyper-threading technology when the first ht processors were released , many operating systems were not optimized for hyper-threading technology ( e.g potential solutions to this include the processor changing its cache eviction strategy or the operating system preventing the simultaneous execution , on the same physical core , of threads with different privileges

hyper-threading technology is a form of simultaneous multithreading technology introduced by intel , while the concept behind the technology has been patented by sun microsystems architecturally , a processor with hyper-threading technology consists of two logical processors per core , each of which has its own processor architectural state unlike a traditional dual-processor configuration that uses two separate physical processors , the logical processors in a hyper-threaded core share the execution resources this allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as the usual '' physical '' processor and an extra '' logical '' processor to the host operating system ( htt-unaware operating systems see two '' physical '' processors ) , allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously and appropriately the minimum that is required to take advantage of hyper-threading is symmetric multiprocessing ( smp ) support in the operating system , as the logical processors appear as standard separate processors for example , consider an smp system with two physical processors that are both hyper-threaded ( for a total of four logical processors ) if the operating system 's thread scheduler is unaware of hyper-threading , it will treat all four logical processors the same the intel core & core 2 processor lines ( 2006 ) that succeeded the pentium 4 model line did n't utilize hyper-threading intel released the nehalem microarchitecture ( core & nbsp ; i7 ) in november 2008 , in which hyper-threading made a return the itanium & nbsp ; 9300 launched with eight threads per processor ( two threads per core ) through enhanced hyper-threading technology this is due to the replay system of the pentium & nbsp ; 4 tying up valuable execution resources , equalizing the processor resources between the two programs , which adds a varying amount of execution time when the first ht processors were released , many operating systems were not optimized for hyper-threading technology ( e.g potential solutions to this include the processor changing its cache eviction strategy or the operating system preventing the simultaneous execution , on the same physical core , of threads with different privileges

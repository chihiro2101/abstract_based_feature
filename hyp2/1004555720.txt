hyper-threading technology is a form of simultaneous multithreading technology introduced by intel , while the concept behind the technology has been patented by sun microsystems architecturally , a processor with hyper-threading technology consists of two logical processors per core , each of which has its own processor architectural state unlike a traditional dual-processor configuration that uses two separate physical processors , the logical processors in a hyper-threaded core share the execution resources the degree of benefit seen when using a hyper-threaded or multi core processor depends on the needs of the software , and how well it and the operating system are written to manage the processor efficiently this allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as the usual '' physical '' processor and an extra '' logical '' processor to the host operating system ( htt-unaware operating systems see two '' physical '' processors ) , allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously and appropriately when execution resources would not be used by the current task in a processor without hyper-threading , and especially when the processor is stalled , a hyper-threading equipped processor can use those execution resources to execute another scheduled task if the operating system 's thread scheduler is unaware of hyper-threading , it will treat all four logical processors the same it was also included on the 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz northwood-based pentium & nbsp ; 4 in the same year , and then remained as a feature in every pentium & nbsp ; 4 & nbsp ; ht , pentium & nbsp ; 4 extreme edition and pentium extreme edition processor since the p6 microarchitecture was used in earlier iterations of pentium processors , namely , the pentium pro , pentium & nbsp ; ii and pentium & nbsp ; iii ( plus their celeron & xeon derivatives at the time ) the itanium & nbsp ; 9300 launched with eight threads per processor ( two threads per core ) through enhanced hyper-threading technology as a result , performance improvements are very application-dependent ; however , when running two programs that require full attention of the processor , it can actually seem like one or both of the programs slows down slightly when hyper-threading technology is turned on this is due to the replay system of the pentium & nbsp ; 4 tying up valuable execution resources , equalizing the processor resources between the two programs , which adds a varying amount of execution time when the first ht processors were released , many operating systems were not optimized for hyper-threading technology ( e.g

architecturally , a processor with hyper-threading technology consists of two logical processors per core , each of which has its own processor architectural state each logical processor can be individually halted , interrupted or directed to execute a specified thread , independently from the other logical processor sharing the same physical core unlike a traditional dual-processor configuration that uses two separate physical processors , the logical processors in a hyper-threaded core share the execution resources these resources include the execution engine , caches , and system bus interface ; the sharing of resources allows two logical processors to work with each other more efficiently , and allows a logical processor to borrow resources from a stalled logical core ( assuming both logical cores are associated with the same physical core ) this allows a hyper-threading processor to appear as the usual '' physical '' processor and an extra '' logical '' processor to the host operating system ( htt-unaware operating systems see two '' physical '' processors ) , allowing the operating system to schedule two threads or processes simultaneously and appropriately when execution resources would not be used by the current task in a processor without hyper-threading , and especially when the processor is stalled , a hyper-threading equipped processor can use those execution resources to execute another scheduled task the minimum that is required to take advantage of hyper-threading is symmetric multiprocessing ( smp ) support in the operating system , as the logical processors appear as standard separate processors if the operating system 's thread scheduler is unaware of hyper-threading , it will treat all four logical processors the same should an instruction from a given process block the pipe , instructions from other processes would continue after the pipeline drained it was also included on the 3.06 & nbsp ; ghz northwood-based pentium & nbsp ; 4 in the same year , and then remained as a feature in every pentium & nbsp ; 4 & nbsp ; ht , pentium & nbsp ; 4 extreme edition and pentium extreme edition processor since intel released the nehalem microarchitecture ( core & nbsp ; i7 ) in november 2008 , in which hyper-threading made a return the itanium & nbsp ; 9300 launched with eight threads per processor ( two threads per core ) through enhanced hyper-threading technology the intel xeon & nbsp ; 5500 server chips also utilize two-way hyper-threading

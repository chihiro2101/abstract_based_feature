much like fellow alternative rock/industrial band nine inch nails , crosby was the only member but found a touring band who knew the songs well enough to play with him live vast released a teaser of their upcoming debut album visual audio sensory theater , titled vast is , which featured the first four tracks of the album after visual audio sensory theater , elektra pressured crosby to go back to the drawing board and craft an album that was accessible to more listeners , but still retaining the distinct sound of the last album the album featured a more rock-oriented sound , and benefited from major-label funding by allowing crosby to work with the new bombay recording orchestra in india turmoil was abundant during the album 's recording and rehearsal process as crosby constantly fought with record executives over the music 's direction and former backup guitarist rowan robertson wishing to leave vast to begin his own solo career by the end of the album 's recording process , robertson had left vast , and crosby reluctantly moved forward with the band the band became a relative success after music for people , but the album 's poor sales and lack of a second charting single led to tension between elektra and crosby in 2004 , crosby recorded bundles of tracks that were titled turquoise 3.x and crimson 3.x ; they were released through an online electronic delivery outlet with the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label , many record companies were outraged with the releases this release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs , as the online releases were only available via mp3 after a short tour for nude , the band released 2blossoms 's first release , a complete demonstration , which was a collection of early demo tracks during the visual audio sessions then in 2006 , vast released turquoise & crimson , a double-disc collection of all the tracks that were released as bundles online in 2004 online under his label originally it was only available through the 2blossoms website , but it was later released to retail stores during the tour for the double album , vast played at cbgb 's , and , in late 2006 , released live at cbgb 's on their 2blossoms record to moderate sales crosby later said that he only had it in him to do one album like april , and that it was his favorite vast album '' works in progress 4 '' featured four new demo tracks : '' call on me '' , '' broken girl '' , '' like god '' and '' put your lips around my generation '' on april 24 , 2018 , the vast companion was made available for pre-order , a book detailing the stories behind vast songs : '' the book goes into where he jon was when he wrote them , what went into making them , and the stories behind each song visual audio sensory theater ( 1998 ) elektra music for people ( 2000 ) elektra nude ( 2004 ) 456 entertainment / spv turquoise & crimson ( 2006 ) 2blossoms april ( 2007 ) 2blossoms me and you ( 2009 ) 2blossoms making evening and night ( 2014 ) 747audioworks black magic ( 2018 )

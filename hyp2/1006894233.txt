philippa was the daughter of paon de roet , who was a knight of hainault and accompanied queen philippa to england there is no history of her mother , but it is thought that philippa had two sisters and a brother : katherine , elizabeth , and walter her father went to serve the queen 's sister , marguerite , who was the empress of germany and the three younger children – walter , philippa and katherine – were left in the care of queen philippa it was her father 's relationship with royalty that gave philippa and her family high status and a reputation among the upper class , who took philippa in as a 'domicella ' , or lady-in-waiting philippa is believed to have picked up the nickname '' philippa pan '' while working at elizabeth of ulster 's household geoffrey chaucer was commissioned to work as a page in elizabeth 's household in 1357 , where philippa was already working as a domicella , caring for her infant daughter , philippa of eltham after the death of the queen , philippa went to the service of costanza of castile and john of gaunt , the duke of lancaster philippa roet was somewhat higher born than her husband and consideration has been given to the parallels between their relationship and the one in chaucer 's franklin 's tale , which details the relationship between a lower-born knight and a higher-born lady criticsa strong relationship with philippa has been suggested due to an assumption that thomas chose to bear her coat of arms over chaucer 's confusion over this has likely come about because the tomb of him and his wife , constructed by their daughter , alice chaucer , duchess of suffolk , uses roet rather than chaucer arms

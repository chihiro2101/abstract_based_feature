these instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification jury nullification is the source of much debate others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law the argument has been raised that prosecutors are not allowed to seek jury nullification , and therefore defendants should not be allowed to seek it either ) nevertheless , there is little doubt as to the ability of a jury to nullify the law today , there are several issues raised by jury nullification , such as : whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify whether a judge may remove jurors '' for cause '' when they refuse to apply the law as instructed whether a judge may punish a juror for practicing jury nullification in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law the general power of juries to decide on verdicts was recognised in the english magna carta magna carta of 1215 of 1215 , which put into words existing practices : largely , the earliest juries returned verdicts in accordance with the judge or the crown in addition , the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a '' false verdict '' in 1554 , a jury acquitted sir nicholas throckmorton , but was severely punished by the court almost a century later in 1649 , in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification , a jury likewise acquitted john lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against the cromwell regime the theoretician and politician eduard bernstein wrote of lilburne 's trial : in 1653 , lilburne was on trial again and asked the jury to acquit him if it found the death penalty '' unconscionably severe '' in proportion to the crime he had committed the judge attempted to find the jury in contempt of court ; this was ruled inappropriate by the court of common pleas juries continued , even in non-criminal cases , to act in defiance of the crown in scotland , jury nullification had the profound effect of introducing the three-verdict system including the option of '' not proven '' , which remains in scotland to this day to avert this injustice , the jury decided to assert what it believed to be their '' ancient right '' to judge the whole case and not just the facts , rendering the verdict of '' not guilty '' now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt this transition began with motions in limine , to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because they would be informed of the evidence to be excluded although tehlirian 's lawyers did not contest that their client had killed the pasha , the jury returned a verdict of '' not guilty '' although extremely rare , jury nullification occurs in canada perhaps the most famous cases of jury nullification in canada were the various trials of henry morgentaler , who openly operated a private abortion clinic in violation of the criminal code the prosecution in the case demanded for the jury to convict ponting as he had clearly contravened the act by leaking official information about the sinking of the belgrano during the falklands war in the united states , jury nullification first appeared just before the american revolutionary war , when colonial juries frequently exercised their nullification power , principally in maritime cases and cases implicating free speech later , during prohibition , juries often nullified alcohol control laws , possibly as often as 60 % of the time in a well-known example of jury nullification , at the end of wild bill hickok 's trial for the manslaughter of davis tutt in 1865 , judge sempronius boyd gave the jury two instructions he first instructed the jury that a conviction was its only option under the law ; he then instructed them that they could apply the unwritten law of the '' fair fight '' and acquit moylan , 417 f.2d 1002 ( 4th cir.1969 ) , the court affirmed the concept of jury nullification , but upheld the power of a court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect the indiana constitution allows nullification , but does not require informing the jury of this right : '' in all criminal cases whatever , the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts ''

these instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification jury nullification is the source of much debate some maintain that it is an important safeguard of last resort against wrongful imprisonment and government tyranny others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law however , judges retain the rights both to decide sentences and to judgment notwithstanding verdict , acting as a check against malicious juries jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) however , for a prosecutor to nullify a law in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence today , there are several issues raised by jury nullification , such as : whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify whether a judge may remove jurors '' for cause '' when they refuse to apply the law as instructed whether a judge may punish a juror for practicing jury nullification in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law some lawyers use a shadow defense to expose the jury to information that would otherwise be inadmissible , hoping that evidence will trigger a nullification the early history of juries supports the recognition of the de facto power of nullification in addition , the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a '' false verdict '' if the second jury returned a different verdict , that verdict was imposed and the first jury was imprisoned or fined almost a century later in 1649 , in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification , a jury likewise acquitted john lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against the cromwell regime the jury found lilburne '' not guilty of any crime worthy of death '' as the defendant had undoubtedly killed the earl , the law ( as it stood ) required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of '' proven '' or '' not proven '' depending on whether they believed the facts proved the defendant had killed the earl if the jury brought in a '' proven '' verdict , this would lead to carnegie 's hanging , though he had not intended any harm to the earl to avert this injustice , the jury decided to assert what it believed to be their '' ancient right '' to judge the whole case and not just the facts , rendering the verdict of '' not guilty '' now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt , in which it was held that '' the defense can argue law to the jury before the court gives instructions '' later , judges began to demand the parties submit motions in writing , often before the jury was empaneled , to be argued and decided without the jury being present this transition began with motions in limine , to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because they would be informed of the evidence to be excluded although tehlirian 's lawyers did not contest that their client had killed the pasha , the jury returned a verdict of '' not guilty '' however , the crown can not appeal on grounds of an unreasonable acquittal although it can appeal on errors of law krieger , 2006 scc 47 , which confirmed that juries in canada have the power to refuse to apply the law when their consciences require that they do so despite the judge demanding a guilty verdict , the jury now unanimously found penn guilty of preaching but acquitted him on the charge of disturbing the peace and acquitted mead of all charges you would violate your oath and the law if you willfully brought a verdict contrary to the law given to you in this case on june 18 , 2012 , new hampshire passed a law explicitly allowing defense attorneys to inform juries about jury nullification

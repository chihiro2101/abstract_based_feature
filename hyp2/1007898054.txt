these instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification jury nullification is the source of much debate others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) the main deontic issue involved in jury nullification is the tension between democracy self-government and integrity however , for a prosecutor to nullify a law in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence ( for this reason , prosecutorial nullification is typically defined as declination to prosecute today , there are several issues raised by jury nullification , such as : whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify whether a judge may remove jurors '' for cause '' when they refuse to apply the law as instructed whether all legal arguments , except perhaps on motions to exclude evidence , should be made in the presence of the jury in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law some lawyers use a shadow defense to expose the jury to information that would otherwise be inadmissible , hoping that evidence will trigger a nullification the early history of juries supports the recognition of the de facto power of nullification juries were composed primarily of '' laymen '' from the local community juries were packed by hand-selecting or by bribery the jury so as to return the desired verdict in addition , the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a '' false verdict '' if the second jury returned a different verdict , that verdict was imposed and the first jury was imprisoned or fined almost a century later in 1649 , in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification , a jury likewise acquitted john lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against the cromwell regime in scotland , jury nullification had the profound effect of introducing the three-verdict system including the option of '' not proven '' , which remains in scotland to this day if the jury brought in a '' proven '' verdict , this would lead to carnegie 's hanging , though he had not intended any harm to the earl to avert this injustice , the jury decided to assert what it believed to be their '' ancient right '' to judge the whole case and not just the facts , rendering the verdict of '' not guilty '' now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt although tehlirian 's lawyers did not contest that their client had killed the pasha , the jury returned a verdict of '' not guilty '' in obiter dicta , chief justice dickson wrote : the supreme court in 2006 issued a decision , r krieger , 2006 scc 47 , which confirmed that juries in canada have the power to refuse to apply the law when their consciences require that they do so within this decision , it is stated that '' juries are not entitled as a matter of right to refuse to apply the lawâ€”but they do have the power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course '' in recent rulings , the courts have continued to prohibit informing juries about jury nullification in 1988 , the sixth circuit upheld a jury instruction : '' there is no such thing as valid jury nullification you would violate your oath and the law if you willfully brought a verdict contrary to the law given to you in this case the indiana constitution allows nullification , but does not require informing the jury of this right : '' in all criminal cases whatever , the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts ''

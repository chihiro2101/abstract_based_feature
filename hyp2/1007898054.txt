in the past , it was feared that a single judge or panel of government officials might be unduly influenced to follow established legal practice , even when that practice had drifted from its origins similarly , juries are routinely cautioned by courts and some attorneys not to allow sympathy for a party or other affected persons to compromise the fair and dispassionate evaluation of evidence jury nullification is the source of much debate others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law some fear that nullification could be used to permit violence against socially unpopular factions they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) today , there are several issues raised by jury nullification , such as : whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify whether all legal arguments , except perhaps on motions to exclude evidence , should be made in the presence of the jury in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law some lawyers use a shadow defense to expose the jury to information that would otherwise be inadmissible , hoping that evidence will trigger a nullification if the second jury returned a different verdict , that verdict was imposed and the first jury was imprisoned or fined almost a century later in 1649 , in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification , a jury likewise acquitted john lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against the cromwell regime the theoretician and politician eduard bernstein wrote of lilburne 's trial : in 1653 , lilburne was on trial again and asked the jury to acquit him if it found the death penalty '' unconscionably severe '' in proportion to the crime he had committed the judge attempted to find the jury in contempt of court ; this was ruled inappropriate by the court of common pleas then in 1688 , a jury acquitted the seven bishops of the church of england of seditious libel if the jury brought in a '' proven '' verdict , this would lead to carnegie 's hanging , though he had not intended any harm to the earl to avert this injustice , the jury decided to assert what it believed to be their '' ancient right '' to judge the whole case and not just the facts , rendering the verdict of '' not guilty '' now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt '' later , judges began to demand the parties submit motions in writing , often before the jury was empaneled , to be argued and decided without the jury being present this transition began with motions in limine , to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because they would be informed of the evidence to be excluded later that was expanded to include all legal argument , so that today , that earlier practice of arguing law before the jury has been largely forgotten , and judges even declare mistrials or overturn verdicts if legal argument is made to the jury although tehlirian 's lawyers did not contest that their client had killed the pasha , the jury returned a verdict of '' not guilty '' as the prosecution has powers to double jeopardy canada , it lacks the finality found in the united states latimer , 2001 scc 1 , the supreme court discussed jury nullification and indicated that it is a duty of the presiding justice to try to prevent it from occurring within this decision , it is stated that '' juries are not entitled as a matter of right to refuse to apply the lawâ€”but they do have the power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course '' by the late 17th century , the court 's power to punish juries was removed in bushel 's case involving a juror on the case against william penn as punishment , the judge ordered the jurors imprisoned until they paid a fine to the court united states written by justice john marshall harlan , the united states supreme court held 5 to 4 that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws moylan , 417 f.2d 1002 ( 4th cir.1969 ) , the court affirmed the concept of jury nullification , but upheld the power of a court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect the indiana constitution allows nullification , but does not require informing the jury of this right : '' in all criminal cases whatever , the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts ''

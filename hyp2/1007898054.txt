in the past , it was feared that a single judge or panel of government officials might be unduly influenced to follow established legal practice , even when that practice had drifted from its origins these instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification some commonly cited historical examples of jury nullification involve jurors refusing to convict persons accused of violating the fugitive slave act by assisting runaway slaves or being fugitive slaves themselves , and refusal of american colonial juries to convict a defendant under english law others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) the main deontic issue involved in jury nullification is the tension between democracy self-government and integrity the argument has been raised that prosecutors are not allowed to seek jury nullification , and therefore defendants should not be allowed to seek it either however , for a prosecutor to nullify a law in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence today , there are several issues raised by jury nullification , such as : whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify whether a judge may remove jurors '' for cause '' when they refuse to apply the law as instructed whether a judge may punish a juror for practicing jury nullification in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law some lawyers use a shadow defense to expose the jury to information that would otherwise be inadmissible , hoping that evidence will trigger a nullification by the 12th century , common law courts in england began using juries for more than administrative duties if the second jury returned a different verdict , that verdict was imposed and the first jury was imprisoned or fined then in 1688 , a jury acquitted the seven bishops of the church of england of seditious libel in 1763 and 1765 , juries awarded £4,000 to john wilkes and £300 to john entick , in separate suits for trespass against the crown 's messengers in scotland , jury nullification had the profound effect of introducing the three-verdict system including the option of '' not proven '' , which remains in scotland to this day as the defendant had undoubtedly killed the earl , the law ( as it stood ) required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of '' proven '' or '' not proven '' depending on whether they believed the facts proved the defendant had killed the earl now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt standard jury trial practice in the united states during the founding era and for several decades afterward was to argue all issues of law in the presence of the jury , so that the jury heard the same arguments the bench did in reaching his rulings on motions , in which it was held that '' the defense can argue law to the jury before the court gives instructions '' later , judges began to demand the parties submit motions in writing , often before the jury was empaneled , to be argued and decided without the jury being present latimer , 2001 scc 1 , the supreme court discussed jury nullification and indicated that it is a duty of the presiding justice to try to prevent it from occurring perhaps the most famous cases of jury nullification in canada were the various trials of henry morgentaler , who openly operated a private abortion clinic in violation of the criminal code krieger , 2006 scc 47 , which confirmed that juries in canada have the power to refuse to apply the law when their consciences require that they do so within this decision , it is stated that '' juries are not entitled as a matter of right to refuse to apply the law—but they do have the power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course '' in the united states , jury nullification first appeared just before the american revolutionary war , when colonial juries frequently exercised their nullification power , principally in maritime cases and cases implicating free speech you would violate your oath and the law if you willfully brought a verdict contrary to the law given to you in this case on june 18 , 2012 , new hampshire passed a law explicitly allowing defense attorneys to inform juries about jury nullification

in the past , it was feared that a single judge or panel of government officials might be unduly influenced to follow established legal practice , even when that practice had drifted from its origins others view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial , which undermines the law some fear that nullification could be used to permit violence against socially unpopular factions they point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law jury nullification may also occur in civil suits , in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability ( rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty ) the main deontic issue involved in jury nullification is the tension between democracy self-government and integrity however , for a prosecutor to nullify a law in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence whether a judge may punish a juror for practicing jury nullification whether all legal arguments , except perhaps on motions to exclude evidence , should be made in the presence of the jury in some cases in the united states , a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law some lawyers use a shadow defense to expose the jury to information that would otherwise be inadmissible , hoping that evidence will trigger a nullification juries were packed by hand-selecting or by bribery the jury so as to return the desired verdict this was a common tactic in cases involving treason or sedition in addition , the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a '' false verdict '' if the second jury returned a different verdict , that verdict was imposed and the first jury was imprisoned or fined almost a century later in 1649 , in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification , a jury likewise acquitted john lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against the cromwell regime in 1670 , a petit jury refused to convict william penn of unlawful assembly in bushel 's case the judge attempted to find the jury in contempt of court ; this was ruled inappropriate by the court of common pleas in 1763 and 1765 , juries awarded £4,000 to john wilkes and £300 to john entick , in separate suits for trespass against the crown 's messengers as the defendant had undoubtedly killed the earl , the law ( as it stood ) required the jury merely to look at the facts and pass a verdict of '' proven '' or '' not proven '' depending on whether they believed the facts proved the defendant had killed the earl if the jury brought in a '' proven '' verdict , this would lead to carnegie 's hanging , though he had not intended any harm to the earl now the '' not guilty '' verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence and the '' not proven '' verdict is only used when the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt , in which it was held that '' the defense can argue law to the jury before the court gives instructions '' later , judges began to demand the parties submit motions in writing , often before the jury was empaneled , to be argued and decided without the jury being present this transition began with motions in limine , to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because they would be informed of the evidence to be excluded later that was expanded to include all legal argument , so that today , that earlier practice of arguing law before the jury has been largely forgotten , and judges even declare mistrials or overturn verdicts if legal argument is made to the jury although tehlirian 's lawyers did not contest that their client had killed the pasha , the jury returned a verdict of '' not guilty '' the closest that a jury came to that was in 1917 , when a jury acquitted two teenage boys of arson across the north , local juries acquitted men accused of violating the law on june 18 , 2012 , new hampshire passed a law explicitly allowing defense attorneys to inform juries about jury nullification the indiana constitution allows nullification , but does not require informing the jury of this right : '' in all criminal cases whatever , the jury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts ''

manuscripts of the byzantine text it should be noted , we have no early witness discoveries of either the byzantine text type or the alexandrian text type manuscripts that originate from where the original new testament scriptures were either authored or initially sent to , which was the greater byzantine area the earliest church father to witness to a byzantine text-type in substantial new testament quotations is john chrysostom ( c 383 ) into gothic is often thought to derive from the byzantine text type or an intermediary between the byzantine and western text types zuurmond notes that , especially in the gospel of john , the form of the early byzantine text found in the ethiopic gospels is quite different from the later greek majority text , and agrees in a number of places with papyrus 66 '' one would say that the ethiopian versio antiqua is basically a byzantine text , with some western elements and some remnants of the early egyptian text the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian the form of the byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole ; but sometimes differs consistently from the form of text found in the most common sub-group of byzantine manuscripts as they proliferated after the 11th century in mark 6:33 and luke 24:53 the byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the alexandrian and the western text '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use ) the standard byzantine text used by the eastern , greek-speaking greek orthodox church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century the early byzantine text is near to the alexandrian text in that it differs from the late byzantine text in roughly 3000 places the different byzantine '' majority text '' of hodges & farstad as well as robinson & pierpont is called '' majority '' because it is considered to be the greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the greek manuscripts around 6,500 readings will differ from the hodges and farstad text depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the alexandrian text-type ( wallace 1989 ) according to the preface to the new king james version of the bible , the textus receptus , the alexandrian text-type and the byzantine text-type are 85 % identical ( that is , of the variations that occur in any manuscript , only 15 % actually differ between these three ) this supports the views of scholars such as harry sturz ( 1984 ) and maurice robinson ( 2005 ) that the roots of the byzantine text may go back to a very early date

manuscripts of the byzantine text it should be noted , we have no early witness discoveries of either the byzantine text type or the alexandrian text type manuscripts that originate from where the original new testament scriptures were either authored or initially sent to , which was the greater byzantine area the earliest church father to witness to a byzantine text-type in substantial new testament quotations is john chrysostom ( c 349 – 407 ) ; although the fragmentary surviving works of asterius the sophist ( † 341 ) have also been considered to conform to the byzantine text , gordon d fee , '' the use of greek patristic citations in new testament textual criticism : the state of the question , '' pp 383 ) into gothic is often thought to derive from the byzantine text type or an intermediary between the byzantine and western text types chrysostom and asterius used text only in 75 % agreed with the standard byzantine text the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian the form of the byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole ; but sometimes differs consistently from the form of text found in the most common sub-group of byzantine manuscripts as they proliferated after the 11th century amongst the bulk of later new testament manuscripts it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear byzantine majority reading for each variant ; and a greek new testament text based on these majority readings— '' the majority text '' —has been produced by zane c origin of the byzantine text '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use ) the standard byzantine text used by the eastern , greek-speaking greek orthodox church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century the early byzantine text is near to the alexandrian text in that it differs from the late byzantine text in roughly 3000 places the different byzantine '' majority text '' of hodges & farstad as well as robinson & pierpont is called '' majority '' because it is considered to be the greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the greek manuscripts around 6,500 readings will differ from the hodges and farstad text depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the alexandrian text-type ( wallace 1989 )

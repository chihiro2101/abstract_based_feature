manuscripts of the byzantine text it should be noted , we have no early witness discoveries of either the byzantine text type or the alexandrian text type manuscripts that originate from where the original new testament scriptures were either authored or initially sent to , which was the greater byzantine area the earliest church father to witness to a byzantine text-type in substantial new testament quotations is john chrysostom ( c 349 – 407 ) ; although the fragmentary surviving works of asterius the sophist ( † 341 ) have also been considered to conform to the byzantine text , gordon d 383 ) into gothic is often thought to derive from the byzantine text type or an intermediary between the byzantine and western text types chrysostom and asterius used text only in 75 % agreed with the standard byzantine text zuurmond notes that , especially in the gospel of john , the form of the early byzantine text found in the ethiopic gospels is quite different from the later greek majority text , and agrees in a number of places with papyrus 66 the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian for example , the story of jesus and the woman taken in adultery is absent from the gospel of john in all early byzantine witnesses and versions , but by 11th century has become standard in medieval byzantine witnesses amongst the bulk of later new testament manuscripts it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear byzantine majority reading for each variant ; and a greek new testament text based on these majority readings— '' the majority text '' —has been produced by zane c in mark 6:33 and luke 24:53 the byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the alexandrian and the western text '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use the early byzantine text is near to the alexandrian text in that it differs from the late byzantine text in roughly 3000 places aland placed all manuscripts with standard byzantine text into category v the different byzantine '' majority text '' of hodges & farstad as well as robinson & pierpont is called '' majority '' because it is considered to be the greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the greek manuscripts although the majority of new testament textual critics now favor a text that is alexandrian in complexion , especially after the publication of westcott and hort 's edition , there remain some proponents of the byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs

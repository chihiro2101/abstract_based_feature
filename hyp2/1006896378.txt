manuscripts of the byzantine text it should be noted , we have no early witness discoveries of either the byzantine text type or the alexandrian text type manuscripts that originate from where the original new testament scriptures were either authored or initially sent to , which was the greater byzantine area the earliest church father to witness to a byzantine text-type in substantial new testament quotations is john chrysostom ( c fee , '' the use of greek patristic citations in new testament textual criticism : the state of the question , '' pp 383 ) into gothic is often thought to derive from the byzantine text type or an intermediary between the byzantine and western text types chrysostom and asterius used text only in 75 % agreed with the standard byzantine text '' one would say that the ethiopian versio antiqua is basically a byzantine text , with some western elements and some remnants of the early egyptian text the ethiopic text in the gospels of mark and matthew are closer to the greek majority text , while still differing in a number of notable readings ; but the ethiopic text of the rest of the new testament is clearly alexandrian jerome , in his vulgate revision of the latin gospels text completed around 384 , made eclectic use of greek manuscripts of both byzantine and alexandrian text-types the form of the byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole ; but sometimes differs consistently from the form of text found in the most common sub-group of byzantine manuscripts as they proliferated after the 11th century '' among those modern scholars who believe that the byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs , there is some debate concerning the origin of the byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use the early byzantine text is near to the alexandrian text in that it differs from the late byzantine text in roughly 3000 places this text came to be known as the textus receptus or received text after being thus termed by bonaventura elzevir , an enterprising publisher from the netherlands , in his 1633 edition of erasmus ' text karl lachmann ( 1850 ) was the first new testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the textus receptus , relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the alexandrian text-type although the majority of new testament textual critics now favor a text that is alexandrian in complexion , especially after the publication of westcott and hort 's edition , there remain some proponents of the byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs ( in 1963 bruce metzger had argued that early support for byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text

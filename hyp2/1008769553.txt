the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon in 1974 , british physicist stephen hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory , the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to '' leak '' into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon hawking 's insight was based on a phenomenon of quantum physics known as virtual particles , and their behaviour near the event horizon careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy considering the thermal properties of black holes , and conservation laws affecting this process , hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole this radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself , but rather is a result of virtual particles being '' boosted '' by the black hole 's gravitation into becoming real particles as the particleâ€“antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole 's gravitational energy , the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole in order to preserve total energy , the particle that fell into the black hole must have had a negative energy ( with respect to an observer far away from the black hole ) a black hole of one solar mass has a temperature of only 60 & nbsp ; nanokelvins ( 60 nano- of a kelvin ) ; in fact , such a black hole would absorb far more cosmic microwave background radiation than it emits close to the event horizon of a black hole , a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in

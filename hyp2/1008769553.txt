a black hole occurs when more than a certain amount of matter and/or energy is located within a small enough space the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon this region is the black hole 's boundary , in effect in effect this energy acted as if the black hole itself was slowly evaporation ( although it actually came from outside it ) this radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself , but rather is a result of virtual particles being '' boosted '' by the black hole 's gravitation into becoming real particles as the particleâ€“antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole 's gravitational energy , the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole this causes the black hole to lose mass , and , to an outside observer , it would appear that the black hole has just emitted a particle a black hole of ( about the mass of the moon , or about across ) would be in equilibrium at 2.7 & nbsp ; k , absorbing as much radiation as it emits close to the event horizon of a black hole , a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in hawking radiation calculator tool the case for mini black holes a

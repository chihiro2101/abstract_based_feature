a black hole occurs when more than a certain amount of matter and/or energy is located within a small enough space given a large enough mass in a small enough space , the gravitational forces become large enough that within a nearby region of space , nothing - not even light - can escape from inside that region to the wider universe the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy considering the thermal properties of black holes , and conservation laws affecting this process , hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole this radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself , but rather is a result of virtual particles being '' boosted '' by the black hole 's gravitation into becoming real particles this causes the black hole to lose mass , and , to an outside observer , it would appear that the black hole has just emitted a particle an important difference between the black hole radiation as computed by hawking and thermal radiation emitted from a black body is that the latter is statistical in nature , and only its average satisfies what is known as planck 's law of black-body radiation , while the former fits the data better thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it , while hawking radiation seems to contain no such information , and depends only on the mass , angular momentum , and charge of the black hole ( the no-hair theorem ) hawking radiation is required by unruh effect and the equivalence principle applied to black hole horizons

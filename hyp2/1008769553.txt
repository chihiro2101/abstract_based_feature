a black hole occurs when more than a certain amount of matter and/or energy is located within a small enough space the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon it is unknown what exactly happens to the mass inside a black hole in 1974 , british physicist stephen hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory , the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to '' leak '' into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon in effect this energy acted as if the black hole itself was slowly evaporation ( although it actually came from outside it ) considering the thermal properties of black holes , and conservation laws affecting this process , hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole as the particleâ€“antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole 's gravitational energy , the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole in order to preserve total energy , the particle that fell into the black hole must have had a negative energy ( with respect to an observer far away from the black hole ) this causes the black hole to lose mass , and , to an outside observer , it would appear that the black hole has just emitted a particle thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it , while hawking radiation seems to contain no such information , and depends only on the mass , angular momentum , and charge of the black hole ( the no-hair theorem )

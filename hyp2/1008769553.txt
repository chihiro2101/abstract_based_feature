the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon however , in either case , the event horizon is at some distance from any such point , so the force of gravity is a little weaker at the event horizon ( although still exceedingly strong ) in 1974 , british physicist stephen hawking used quantum field theory in curved spacetime to show that in theory , the force of gravity at the event horizon was strong enough to cause energy to '' leak '' into the wider universe within a tiny distance of the event horizon careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy in effect to an observer it would appear as if the gravitational force had somehow allowed the black hole 's energy to be reduced and the energy of the wider universe to be increased as the particle–antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole 's gravitational energy , the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole an alternative view of the process is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle–antiparticle pair to appear close to the event horizon of a black hole this causes the black hole to lose mass , and , to an outside observer , it would appear that the black hole has just emitted a particle this means that no information loss is expected in black holes ( since the theory permits no such loss ) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation close to the event horizon of a black hole , a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in

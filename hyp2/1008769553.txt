the boundary of that region is known as the event horizon because an observer outside it can not observe , become aware of , or be affected by events within the event horizon this region is the black hole 's boundary , in effect careful analysis showed that if this happened , quantum effects would cause a '' partner wave '' carrying negative energy to be created and also pass into the black hole , reducing the black hole 's total mass , or energy in effect to an observer it would appear as if the gravitational force had somehow allowed the black hole 's energy to be reduced and the energy of the wider universe to be increased considering the thermal properties of black holes , and conservation laws affecting this process , hawking calculated that the visible outcome would be a very low level of exact black-body radiation - electromagnetic radiation produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole this radiation does not come directly from the black hole itself , but rather is a result of virtual particles being '' boosted '' by the black hole 's gravitation into becoming real particles as the particleâ€“antiparticle pair was produced by the black hole 's gravitational energy , the escape of one of the particles lowers the mass of the black hole thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it , while hawking radiation seems to contain no such information , and depends only on the mass , angular momentum , and charge of the black hole ( the no-hair theorem ) this means that no information loss is expected in black holes ( since the theory permits no such loss ) and the radiation emitted by a black hole is probably the usual thermal radiation close to the event horizon of a black hole , a local observer must accelerate to keep from falling in

: the idea that semen contains an embryo – a preformed , miniature infant , or homunculus – that simply becomes larger during development the competing explanation of embryonic development was epigenesis , originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by aristotle cleavage is the very beginning steps of a developing embryo cleavage refers to the many mitotic divisions that occur after the egg is fertilized by the sperm the ways in which the cells divide is specific to certain types of animals and may have many forms holoblastic cleavage can be radial ( see : radial cleavage ) , spiral ( see : spiral cleavage ) , bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , or rotational ( see : rotational cleavage ) in holoblastic cleavage the entire egg will divide and become the embryo , whereas in meroblastic cleavage some cells will become the embryo and others will be the yolk sac meroblastic cleavage can bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , discoidal ( see : discoidal cleavage ) , or centrolecithal ( see : centrolecithal ) animals that belong to the basal phyla have holoblastic radial cleavage which results in radial symmetry ( see : symmetry in biology ) the basal phyla also has only one to two embryonic cell layers , compared to the three in bilateral animals ( endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm ) until the birth of modern embryology through observation of the mammalian ovum by karl ernst von baer in 1827 , there was no clear scientific understanding of embryology many principles of embryology apply to invertebrates as well as to vertebrates therefore , the study of invertebrate embryology has advanced the study of vertebrate embryology although invertebrate embryology is similar in some ways for different invertebrate animals , there are also countless variations abortion embryogenesis embryonic differentiation waves embryology of digestive system and the body cavities french flag model morphogen ontogeny recapitulation theory

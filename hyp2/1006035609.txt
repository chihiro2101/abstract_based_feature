the competing explanation of embryonic development was epigenesis , originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by aristotle cleavage is the very beginning steps of a developing embryo cleavage refers to the many mitotic divisions that occur after the egg is fertilized by the sperm the ways in which the cells divide is specific to certain types of animals and may have many forms holoblastic cleavage can be radial ( see : radial cleavage ) , spiral ( see : spiral cleavage ) , bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , or rotational ( see : rotational cleavage ) in holoblastic cleavage the entire egg will divide and become the embryo , whereas in meroblastic cleavage some cells will become the embryo and others will be the yolk sac meroblastic cleavage can bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , discoidal ( see : discoidal cleavage ) , or centrolecithal ( see : centrolecithal ) animals that belong to the basal phyla have holoblastic radial cleavage which results in radial symmetry ( see : symmetry in biology ) soon after the gastrula is formed , three distinct layers of cells ( the germ layers ) from which all the bodily organs and tissues then develop evolutionary embryology is the expansion of comparative embryology by the ideas of charles darwin until the birth of modern embryology through observation of the mammalian ovum by karl ernst von baer in 1827 , there was no clear scientific understanding of embryology only in the late 1950s when ultrasound was first used for uterine scanning , was the true developmental chronology of human fetus available karl ernst von baer along with heinz christian pander , also proposed the germ layer theory of development which helped to explain how the embryo developed in progressive steps embryology is central to evolutionary developmental biology ( '' evo-devo '' ) , which studies the genetic control of the development process ( e.g therefore , the study of invertebrate embryology has advanced the study of vertebrate embryology

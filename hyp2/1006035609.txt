: the idea that semen contains an embryo – a preformed , miniature infant , or homunculus – that simply becomes larger during development the competing explanation of embryonic development was epigenesis , originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by aristotle much early embryology came from the work of the italy anatomists aldrovandi , aranzio , leonardo da vinci , marcello malpighi , gabriele falloppio , girolamo cardano , emilio parisano , fortunio liceti , stefano lorenzini , spallanzani , enrico sertoli , and mauro ruscóni as microscopy improved during the 19th century , biologists could see that embryos took shape in a series of progressive steps , and epigenesis displaced preformation as the favored explanation among embryologists in holoblastic cleavage the entire egg will divide and become the embryo , whereas in meroblastic cleavage some cells will become the embryo and others will be the yolk sac the division furrow does not protrude into the yolky region as those cells impede membrane formation and this causes the incomplete separation of cells meroblastic cleavage can bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , discoidal ( see : discoidal cleavage ) , or centrolecithal ( see : centrolecithal ) if in the blastula the first pore , or blastopore , becomes the mouth of the animal , it is a protostome ; if the blastopore becomes the anus then it is a deuterostome soon after the gastrula is formed , three distinct layers of cells ( the germ layers ) from which all the bodily organs and tissues then develop the outer layer of cells , or ectoderm , gives rise to the nervous system , including the brain , and skin or carapace and hair , bristles , or scales the studies that have been conducted have discovered many useful aspects of development that not only apply to fruit flies but other species as well until the birth of modern embryology through observation of the mammalian ovum by karl ernst von baer in 1827 , there was no clear scientific understanding of embryology karl ernst von baer along with heinz christian pander , also proposed the germ layer theory of development which helped to explain how the embryo developed in progressive steps therefore , the study of invertebrate embryology has advanced the study of vertebrate embryology abortion embryogenesis embryonic differentiation waves embryology of digestive system and the body cavities french flag model morphogen ontogeny recapitulation theory

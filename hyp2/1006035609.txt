: the idea that semen contains an embryo – a preformed , miniature infant , or homunculus – that simply becomes larger during development the competing explanation of embryonic development was epigenesis , originally proposed 2,000 years earlier by aristotle cleavage is the very beginning steps of a developing embryo cleavage refers to the many mitotic divisions that occur after the egg is fertilized by the sperm the ways in which the cells divide is specific to certain types of animals and may have many forms holoblastic cleavage can be radial ( see : radial cleavage ) , spiral ( see : spiral cleavage ) , bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , or rotational ( see : rotational cleavage ) in holoblastic cleavage the entire egg will divide and become the embryo , whereas in meroblastic cleavage some cells will become the embryo and others will be the yolk sac the division furrow does not protrude into the yolky region as those cells impede membrane formation and this causes the incomplete separation of cells meroblastic cleavage can bilateral ( see : bilateral cleavage ) , discoidal ( see : discoidal cleavage ) , or centrolecithal ( see : centrolecithal ) the basal phyla also has only one to two embryonic cell layers , compared to the three in bilateral animals ( endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm ) during gastrulation the blastula develops in one of two ways that divide the whole animal kingdom into two-halves ( see : embryological origins of the mouth and anus ) until the birth of modern embryology through observation of the mammalian ovum by karl ernst von baer in 1827 , there was no clear scientific understanding of embryology part of this explanation explored why embryos in many species often appear similar to one another in early developmental stages using his four principles embryology is central to evolutionary developmental biology ( '' evo-devo '' ) , which studies the genetic control of the development process ( e.g therefore , the study of invertebrate embryology has advanced the study of vertebrate embryology

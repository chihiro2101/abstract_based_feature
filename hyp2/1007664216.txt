the magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber there is considerable evidence for magma mixing just prior to many eruptions , including magnesium-rich olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim this is possible only if the lava erupted immediately after mixing , since olivine rapidly reacts with silicic magma to form a rim of pyroxene for example , sector collapse ( where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide ) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers whatever the precise mechanism , the pressure in the magma chamber increases to a critical point where the roof of the magma chamber fractures and the contents of the magma chamber are provided with a path to the surface through which to erupt in recorded history , explosive eruptions at subduction zone ( convergent-boundary ) volcanoes have posed the greatest hazard to civilizations most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and lahars , deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes on june 15 , mount pinatubo spewed an ash cloud into the air and produced huge pyroclastic surges and lahar floods that devastated a large area around the volcano vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous volcanoes , due to its capacity for plinian eruption combined with the high population density of the surrounding metropolitan naples area ( totaling about 3.6 & nbsp ; million inhabitants ) apart from possibly affecting the climate , volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a serious hazard to aviation safety dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruption column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions , can generate devastating pyroclastic flows or surges , which can sweep off everything in their paths rarely , generally fluid lava could also generate massive lava fountains , while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent , creating a block which can result in highly explosive eruptions hot ash clouds , lava flows and pyroclastic surges ejected during 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz in colombia melted snow and ice atop the high andean volcano

the magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab the water freed from the rock lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle rock , which then undergoes partial melting and rises due to its lighter density relative to the surrounding mantle rock , and pools temporarily at the base of the lithosphere the magma then rises through the crust , incorporating silica-rich crustal rock , leading to a final intermediate composition when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber when anhydrous minerals such as feldspar crystallize out of the magma , this concentrates volatiles in the remaining liquid , which can lead to second boiling that causes a gas phase ( carbon dioxide or water ) to separate from the liquid magma and raise magma chamber pressures injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber , which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present for example , sector collapse ( where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide ) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber whatever the precise mechanism , the pressure in the magma chamber increases to a critical point where the roof of the magma chamber fractures and the contents of the magma chamber are provided with a path to the surface through which to erupt helens , mount etna and mount pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases as a consequence , the tremendous internal pressures of the trapped volcanic gases remain and intermingle in the pasty magma most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and lahars , deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes on june 15 , mount pinatubo spewed an ash cloud into the air and produced huge pyroclastic surges and lahar floods that devastated a large area around the volcano dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruption column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions , can generate devastating pyroclastic flows or surges , which can sweep off everything in their paths fluid lavas are typically associated with the formation of broad shield volcanoes such as those of hawaii , but nyiragongo has very steep slopes down which lava can flow at up to hot ash clouds , lava flows and pyroclastic surges ejected during 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz in colombia melted snow and ice atop the high andean volcano

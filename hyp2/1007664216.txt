stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones , forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust ( continental arc volcanism , e.g the magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber when anhydrous minerals such as feldspar crystallize out of the magma , this concentrates volatiles in the remaining liquid , which can lead to second boiling that causes a gas phase ( carbon dioxide or water ) to separate from the liquid magma and raise magma chamber pressures injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber , which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present there is considerable evidence for magma mixing just prior to many eruptions , including magnesium-rich olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim for example , sector collapse ( where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide ) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers helens , mount etna and mount pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases pyroclastic flows are swift , avalanche-like , ground-sweeping , incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris , fine ash , fragmented lava and superheated gases that can travel at speeds in excess of unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in japan ; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 peopleâ€”the worst volcanic disaster in the nation 's history dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruption column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions , can generate devastating pyroclastic flows or surges , which can sweep off everything in their paths lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to humans and animals because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for everyone to flee out of the path of flow rarely , generally fluid lava could also generate massive lava fountains , while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent , creating a block which can result in highly explosive eruptions as per the above examples , while the unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past , the impact of the june 1991 eruption of mount pinatubo was global

stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones , forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust ( continental arc volcanism , e.g the magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber , which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present there is considerable evidence for magma mixing just prior to many eruptions , including magnesium-rich olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers helens , mount etna and mount pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and lahars , deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes pyroclastic flows are swift , avalanche-like , ground-sweeping , incandescent mixtures of hot volcanic debris , fine ash , fragmented lava and superheated gases that can travel at speeds in excess of around 30,000 people were killed by pyroclastic flows during the 1902 eruption of mount pelée on the island of martinique in the caribbean on june 15 , mount pinatubo spewed an ash cloud into the air and produced huge pyroclastic surges and lahar floods that devastated a large area around the volcano unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in japan ; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 people—the worst volcanic disaster in the nation 's history dense clouds of hot volcanic ash , caused by the collapse of an eruption column or by being laterally expelled from the partial collapse of a volcanic edifice or lava dome during explosive eruptions , can generate devastating pyroclastic flows or surges , which can sweep off everything in their paths lava flows from stratovolcanoes are generally not a significant threat to humans and animals because the highly viscous lava moves slowly enough for everyone to flee out of the path of flow hot ash clouds , lava flows and pyroclastic surges ejected during 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz in colombia melted snow and ice atop the high andean volcano

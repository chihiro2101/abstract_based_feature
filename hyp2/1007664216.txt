stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones , forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust ( continental arc volcanism , e.g the magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber there is considerable evidence for magma mixing just prior to many eruptions , including magnesium-rich olivine crystals in freshly erupted silicic lava that show no reaction rim this is possible only if the lava erupted immediately after mixing , since olivine rapidly reacts with silicic magma to form a rim of pyroxene magma differentiation and thermal expansion also are ineffective as triggers for eruptions from deep magma chambers subduction-zone stratovolcanoes , such as mount st most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and lahars , deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes on june 15 , mount pinatubo spewed an ash cloud into the air and produced huge pyroclastic surges and lahar floods that devastated a large area around the volcano also in 1991 , japan 's unzen volcano , located on the island of kyushu about east of nagasaki , awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in japan ; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 peopleâ€”the worst volcanic disaster in the nation 's history the eruption of mount vesuvius in 79 completely smothered the nearby ancient cities of pompeii and herculaneum with thick deposits of pyroclastic surges and lava flows vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous volcanoes , due to its capacity for plinian eruption combined with the high population density of the surrounding metropolitan naples area ( totaling about 3.6 & nbsp ; million inhabitants ) fluid lavas are typically associated with the formation of broad shield volcanoes such as those of hawaii , but nyiragongo has very steep slopes down which lava can flow at up to as per the above examples , while the unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past , the impact of the june 1991 eruption of mount pinatubo was global

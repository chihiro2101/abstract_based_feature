stratovolcanoes are common at subduction zones , forming chains and clusters along plate tectonic boundaries where oceanic crust is drawn under continental crust ( continental arc volcanism , e.g the magma forming stratovolcanoes rises when water trapped both in hydrated minerals and in the porous basalt rock of the upper oceanic crust is released into mantle rock of the asthenosphere above the sinking oceanic slab when the magma nears the top surface , it pools in a magma chamber within the crust below the stratovolcano possible mechanisms include : magma differentiation , in which the lightest , most silica-rich magma and volatiles such as water , halogens , and sulfur dioxide accumulate in the uppermost part of the magma chamber injection of fresh magma into the magma chamber , which mixes and heats the cooler magma already present this is possible only if the lava erupted immediately after mixing , since olivine rapidly reacts with silicic magma to form a rim of pyroxene for example , sector collapse ( where part of the flank of a volcano collapses in a massive landslide ) can trigger eruption only of a very shallow magma chamber helens , mount etna and mount pinatubo , typically erupt with explosive force : the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases most deaths were caused by pyroclastic flows and lahars , deadly hazards that often accompany explosive eruptions of subduction-zone stratovolcanoes around 30,000 people were killed by pyroclastic flows during the 1902 eruption of mount pelée on the island of martinique in the caribbean unzen is one of more than 75 active volcanoes in japan ; an eruption in 1792 killed more than 15,000 people—the worst volcanic disaster in the nation 's history the eruption of mount vesuvius in 79 completely smothered the nearby ancient cities of pompeii and herculaneum with thick deposits of pyroclastic surges and lava flows apart from possibly affecting the climate , volcanic clouds from explosive eruptions also pose a serious hazard to aviation safety rarely , generally fluid lava could also generate massive lava fountains , while lava of thicker viscosity can solidify within the vent , creating a block which can result in highly explosive eruptions hot ash clouds , lava flows and pyroclastic surges ejected during 1985 eruption of nevado del ruiz in colombia melted snow and ice atop the high andean volcano as per the above examples , while the unzen eruptions have caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past , the impact of the june 1991 eruption of mount pinatubo was global

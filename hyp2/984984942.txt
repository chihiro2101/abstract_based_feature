depending on the detail of the images to be printed , the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen '' line screen '' is the term used for the number of cells engraved on the anilox depending on the design of the printing press , the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain , or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller , which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain a doctor blade is used to shave excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells the roll then rotates to make contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material anilox roll selection should be based on cell volume or capacity of the engraved cells contemporary ink metering systems employ a self contained system known as a chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll the other reverse angle blade works as previously described , removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll the characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate : angle of the cells , cell volume , and line screen there are two ways to specify anilox roll settings : on transfer volume or on line count line count measures the finesse of the pattern on the anilox roll this is because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll , the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink anilox rolls can also become damaged if a steel doctor blade breaks and begins to grind the anilox roll

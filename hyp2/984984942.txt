depending on the detail of the images to be printed , the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen '' line screen '' is the term used for the number of cells engraved on the anilox low line screen rolls ( 100-300 lpi ) are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired , such as in heavy block lettering a doctor blade is used to shave excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells anilox roll selection should be based on cell volume or capacity of the engraved cells the other reverse angle blade works as previously described , removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll the characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate : angle of the cells , cell volume , and line screen both cell volume and line screen are closely correlated the rolls are often specified by their line screen , which is the number of cells per linear inch there are two ways to specify anilox roll settings : on transfer volume or on line count the european standard for transfer volume is cm³/m² or cubic centimetre per square meter , which means 1 cm³ of ink will be transferred onto 1 m² of paper the conversion from transfer volume to line count is not straightforward this is because depending on the pattern used for the cell and depth of gravure of the anilox roll , the cell might contain higher or lower volumes of ink

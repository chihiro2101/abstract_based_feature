depending on the detail of the images to be printed , the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower line screen '' line screen '' is the term used for the number of cells engraved on the anilox low line screen rolls ( 100-300 lpi ) are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired , such as in heavy block lettering often a job will require a different line screen for each color to be printed depending on the design of the printing press , the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain , or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller , which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain a doctor blade is used to shave excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells the roll then rotates to make contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material anilox roll selection should be based on cell volume or capacity of the engraved cells contemporary ink metering systems employ a self contained system known as a chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll the characteristics of an anilox roll determine the amount of ink that will be transferred to the plate : angle of the cells , cell volume , and line screen low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed , whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing anilox rolls are properly specified by cell volume for the required print application anilox rolls can also become damaged if a steel doctor blade breaks and begins to grind the anilox roll

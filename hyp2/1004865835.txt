robbins later sold the rights to uno to a group of friends headed by robert tezak , a funeral parlor owner in joliet , illinois , for 50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game the aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points , achieved ( usually over several rounds of play ) by being the first to play all of one 's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players the deck consists of 108 cards : four each of '' wild '' and '' wild draw four , '' and 25 each of four different colors ( red , yellow , green , blue ) '' to start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile the player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or wild card ( see below ) action or wild cards have the following effects : a player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn a player may play a wild card at any time , even if that player has other playable cards a player may play a wild draw four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color the player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a wild card and still play the wild draw four card a player who plays their next-to-last-card must call '' uno '' as a warning to the other players number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and wild and wild draw four cards count 50 if a draw two or wild draw four card is played to go out , the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied if a player does not call '' uno '' after laying down their next-to-last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn ( i.e , plays a card from their hand , draws from the deck , or touches the discard pile ) , they must draw two cards as a penalty if a player plays a wild draw four card , the following player can challenge its use the player who used the wild draw four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards if the challenge is correct , then the challenged player draws four cards instead in a two-player game , the reverse card acts like a skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn ) this house rule is so commonly used that there was widespread twitter surprise in 2019 when mattel stated that stacking was not part of the standard rules of uno jump-in : if a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn an offensive strategy would be holding on to wild and wild draw four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out ( when it 's harder to play a matching card ) a defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand a player who calls '' uno '' risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying '' uno '' , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn for this reason , it is useful to conceal how many cards are in one 's own hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds earlier english versions can be recognised by the absence of the white rim that surrounds the edge of most uno cards barbie uno features the '' friendship '' card , where the player can swap his/her hand with another player ( 2007 ) the simpsons uno ( 2003 ) the simpsons ( d'oh ) uno ( 2009 ) the simpsons : springfield / great scot uno ( 2006 ) treehouse of horror ( series ) uno ( 2005 ) snappy dresser sock monkey uno south park uno ( 2004 ) speed racer this set has a special racer x card the player can also select a new color just like a wild card this deck contains a special hadouken card , which allows the user to choose 1 player to draw cards until they have drawn a skip or a reverse card many variations from standard gameplay exist , such as elimination uno , speed uno and pirate uno the game can be played with two decks of standard playing cards , if the jokers are marked up as the zeroes of the four suits , and the royalty treated as the special cards

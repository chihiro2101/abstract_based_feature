the game was originally developed in 1971 by merle robbins in reading , ohio , a suburb of cincinnati when his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent 8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made robbins later sold the rights to uno to a group of friends headed by robert tezak , a funeral parlor owner in joliet , illinois , for 50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game the aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points , achieved ( usually over several rounds of play ) by being the first to play all of one 's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players the deck consists of 108 cards : four each of '' wild '' and '' wild draw four , '' and 25 each of four different colors ( red , yellow , green , blue ) the player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or wild card ( see below ) action or wild cards have the following effects : a player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn a player may play a wild card at any time , even if that player has other playable cards a player may play a wild draw four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color the player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a wild card and still play the wild draw four card a player who plays a wild draw four may be challenged by the next player in sequence ( see penalties ) to prove that their hand meets this condition exact wording of the official rules : 'when you play your next-to-last card , you must yell '' uno '' ( meaning '' one '' ) to indicate that you have only one card left' the first player to get rid of their last card ( '' going out '' ) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and wild and wild draw four cards count 50 if a player plays a wild draw four card , the following player can challenge its use the player who used the wild draw four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards in a two-player game , the reverse card acts like a skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn jump-in : if a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn a player who calls '' uno '' risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying '' uno '' , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn for this reason , it is useful to conceal how many cards are in one 's own hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds other versions of the game use symbols and images in both old and new designs , especially ones with wild cards that do not bear the word '' wild '' the 2010 '' uno mod '' edition uses symbols instead of letters or numbers these theme games may come with slightly different directions and special cards barbie uno features the '' friendship '' card , where the player can swap his/her hand with another player disney sofia the first uno card game in foil bag one piece uno ( 2003 , 2011 ) one piece : the new world uno ( japan-2012 ) over the hedge uno ( 2006 ) paw patrol uno ( 2015 ) peanuts uno ( 2002 ) wei , r spongebob squarepants 1 super absorbency ( 1 ) uno â€“ which features the super absorbency card , a wild card which requires the next player to draw one card from all other players ' hands at random however , this check two card can not be played : on its own ( without a card of the same suit color ) , or as the last card in your hand project gotham racing uno in this game , the cards are drawn like cars seen in the project gotham racing series of video games uno : the game show current official rules , from mattel official mattel uno site uno rules at unorulesonline.com uno variations at unovariations.com uno variants at pagat.com uno news at wonkavator

when his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent 8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made robbins later sold the rights to uno to a group of friends headed by robert tezak , a funeral parlor owner in joliet , illinois , for 50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game the aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points , achieved ( usually over several rounds of play ) by being the first to play all of one 's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held by the other players the deck consists of 108 cards : four each of '' wild '' and '' wild draw four , '' and 25 each of four different colors ( red , yellow , green , blue ) each color consists of one zero , two each of 1 through 9 , and two each of '' skip , '' '' draw two , '' and '' reverse '' to start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , and the top card of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile action or wild cards have the following effects : a player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn a player may play a wild card at any time , even if that player has other playable cards a player may play a wild draw four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color the player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a wild card and still play the wild draw four card the first player to get rid of their last card ( '' going out '' ) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and wild and wild draw four cards count 50 if a draw two or wild draw four card is played to go out , the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied the player who used the wild draw four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards in a two-player game , the reverse card acts like a skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn the following official house rules are suggested in the uno rulebook , to alter the game : progressive uno : if a draw card is played , and the following player has the same card , they can play that card and '' stack '' the penalty , which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the following player jump-in : if a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn a strategy at uno may be offensive ( aiming to go out ) , or defensive ( aiming to minimize the value of one 's hand , in the event that another player goes out , thus getting those points ) an offensive strategy would be holding on to wild and wild draw four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out ( when it 's harder to play a matching card ) a player who calls '' uno '' risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying '' uno '' , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn barbie uno features the '' friendship '' card , where the player can swap his/her hand with another player ( 2004 ) ( 2013 ) disney channel / disney shows uno deck features many of the characters on the disney channel disney sofia the first uno card game in foil bag ( 2007 ) spider-man uno ( 2002 ) spider-man 2 uno ( 2004 ) spider-man spider sense uno marvel ultimate spider-man web-warriors uno ( 2014 ) splash uno comes with a handy clip that keeps all the cards together and attaches to a beach bag , backpack or camping gear spongebob squarepants 1 super absorbency ( 1 ) uno â€“ which features the super absorbency card , a wild card which requires the next player to draw one card from all other players ' hands at random that player can then call a new color , and play resumes as if they had played a regular wild ) ( 2008 ) clone wars ( star wars ) uno super mario ( 2016 ) superman uno ( 2005 ) superman returns uno ( 2005 ) sydney 2000 uno ( 1999 ) susan g if the check two card is the last card in a player hand , he/she must take another card from the draw pile uno : the game show uno is a member of the shedding family of card games crazy eights black jack ( switch ) switch ( card game ) eleusis last card macau mao mau mau ( game ) o'no 99 one card ( game ) phase 10 skip-bo taki whot !

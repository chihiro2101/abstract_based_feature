in the renaissance his name and his works became confused with his son seneca the younger he noted that two of the elder seneca 's grandsons were called marcus and since there was a roman custom for boys to be given the name of their grandfather , raphael adopted the name of marcus for the elder seneca however it is now accepted that this naming custom was not rigid , and since in the manuscripts he is referred to as lucius , many scholars now prefer this praenomen since it would also help explain why their works became so confused the elder seneca was born in spain at a date sufficiently early that he might , theoretically , have heard the voice of cicero , had he been living in italy as a boy it emerges from some of the elder seneca 's own words controversiae 2 pr it was on the basis of his experiences in the schools and auditoria of the declaimers of augustan and tiberian rome that the elder seneca wrote , in his old age , the work on which his fame rests today , the oratorum et rhetorum sententiae divisiones colores it is not a collection of his own declamations , or of complete fair copies of those delivered by any other declaimer but instead it presents representative extracts and analyses of the declamatory art of a considerable number of the rhetorical celebrities of his younger days 'declamation ' of the sort that they practised , was , according to the elder seneca , a new art , born after his own birth it so happened that porcius latro , a great friend from the elder seneca 's corduban childhood , became one of rome 's leading rhetoricians in the augustan era 22 , 24 in his friend 's view latro 's only serious rival for supremacy among rome 's declaimers was the orator junius gallio , another close family connection of the senecas but the end of seneca 's tribute to him controversiae i pr 13 illustrates how both men inhabited a literary world far distant from cicero 's , one in which delight in neat contrasts and paradoxes had become all-consuming : 'no one ' wrote seneca of latro , 'was more in command of his intellect : no one was more indulgent towards it ' in the prefaces to the books of controversiae seneca took pains to identify their distinguishing characteristics and was by no means entirely dismissive of those who fell short of his latronian ideal ' controversiae 2 pr 1 but there was no denying the distinction of the school of arellius fuscus , whose pupils included the philosophical writer fabianus controversiae 2 pr the elder seneca 's claim to the authorship of this declamatory anthology , generally ascribed to his son during the middle ages , was vindicated by the renaissance humanism raffaello maffei and justus lipsius seneca was also the author of a lost historical work , containing the history of rome from the beginning of the civil wars almost down to his own death , after which it was published by his son this fragment is prefatory in character and pessimistic in outlook , likening as it does the history of rome to the seven ages of man , and comparing the reversion of rome to monarchical rule with the 'second infancy ' of senility annaeus seneca , and that in view of the clear preponderance in what can be read of the text 's contents , of historical and political matter relating to the first decades of the roman empire , it is most likely to have originated in the elder seneca 's histories the rhetorical collection of the elder seneca : textual tradition and traditional text works by seneca the elder at perseus digital library seneca , suasoriae - english translation by w.a

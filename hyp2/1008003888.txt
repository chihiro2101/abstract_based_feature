seneca the elder is the first of the gens annaea of whom there is definite knowledge in the renaissance his name and his works became confused with his son seneca the younger he noted that two of the elder seneca 's grandsons were called marcus and since there was a roman custom for boys to be given the name of their grandfather , raphael adopted the name of marcus for the elder seneca however it is now accepted that this naming custom was not rigid , and since in the manuscripts he is referred to as lucius , many scholars now prefer this praenomen since it would also help explain why their works became so confused the elder seneca was born in spain at a date sufficiently early that he might , theoretically , have heard the voice of cicero , had he been living in italy as a boy rather the testimony of the younger seneca in a fragment from his de vita patris , suggests that his father remained all his life a private gentleman , declining to seek fame from his writing of a history of rome 'from the beginning of the civil wars ' , on which he was still engaged at the time of his death under the regime of caligula it was on the basis of his experiences in the schools and auditoria of the declaimers of augustan and tiberian rome that the elder seneca wrote , in his old age , the work on which his fame rests today , the oratorum et rhetorum sententiae divisiones colores it is not a collection of his own declamations , or of complete fair copies of those delivered by any other declaimer but instead it presents representative extracts and analyses of the declamatory art of a considerable number of the rhetorical celebrities of his younger days the elder seneca 's own input is confined to pen-portraits of the famous declaimers whom he cites , plus analytical and critical comments about details of their work and anecdotes remembered from the literary chatter of long ago 'declamation ' of the sort that they practised , was , according to the elder seneca , a new art , born after his own birth if its characteristic concentration on the bizarre kind of imaginary lawsuits known as controversiae had earlier precedent in the schools somewhere in the greek-speaking world - as is likely , in view of the remoteness of the subject-matter and legal suppositions of these declamatory themes from the realities of roman law-courts - seneca the elder seems to have been totally unaware of it it so happened that porcius latro , a great friend from the elder seneca 's corduban childhood , became one of rome 's leading rhetoricians in the augustan era 22 , 24 in his friend 's view latro 's only serious rival for supremacy among rome 's declaimers was the orator junius gallio , another close family connection of the senecas ' controversiae 2 pr 1 but there was no denying the distinction of the school of arellius fuscus , whose pupils included the philosophical writer fabianus controversiae 2 pr the elder seneca 's pen-portrait of him is lost , but suetonius ' de rhetoribus 30 describes him vividly as a man who was a greater success as a declaimer than as an orator out of the ten books of controversiae , in which extracts from declamatory treatments of seventy-four judicial themes were presented , only books 1 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 10 survive more or less in their entirety , with the names of individual rhetoricians and seneca 's critical comments included 24 ; 4 pr 1 ; fairweather 29-30 each preface presents pen-portraits of the famous exponents of the declamatory art either individually , or in pairs , before finally , in the tenth preface , seneca offers his readers a group-presentation of declaimers previously overlooked in his extant book of suasoriae , seneca presents sententiae by the declaimers cited , followed by their divisiones , but no colores , as these have no place in deliberation , belonging exclusively to judicial rhetoric annaeus seneca , and that in view of the clear preponderance in what can be read of the text 's contents , of historical and political matter relating to the first decades of the roman empire , it is most likely to have originated in the elder seneca 's histories

in the renaissance his name and his works became confused with his son seneca the younger he noted that two of the elder seneca 's grandsons were called marcus and since there was a roman custom for boys to be given the name of their grandfather , raphael adopted the name of marcus for the elder seneca however it is now accepted that this naming custom was not rigid , and since in the manuscripts he is referred to as lucius , many scholars now prefer this praenomen since it would also help explain why their works became so confused instead , he was confined by wartime conditions 'within the walls ' of his 'own colony ' , controversiae 1 pr 11 and it was presumably there that he received his first schooling from a praeceptor who had more than two hundred pupils 2 as soon as the journey became safe after the civil wars , controversiae 1 pr rather the testimony of the younger seneca in a fragment from his de vita patris , suggests that his father remained all his life a private gentleman , declining to seek fame from his writing of a history of rome 'from the beginning of the civil wars ' , on which he was still engaged at the time of his death under the regime of caligula it emerges from some of the elder seneca 's own words controversiae 2 pr it was on the basis of his experiences in the schools and auditoria of the declaimers of augustan and tiberian rome that the elder seneca wrote , in his old age , the work on which his fame rests today , the oratorum et rhetorum sententiae divisiones colores it is not a collection of his own declamations , or of complete fair copies of those delivered by any other declaimer but instead it presents representative extracts and analyses of the declamatory art of a considerable number of the rhetorical celebrities of his younger days the elder seneca 's own input is confined to pen-portraits of the famous declaimers whom he cites , plus analytical and critical comments about details of their work and anecdotes remembered from the literary chatter of long ago the declaimers of augustan and tiberian rome professed admiration for cicero , but their preferred oratorical style was not very ciceronian and nor was the theoretical basis of their educational method 'declamation ' of the sort that they practised , was , according to the elder seneca , a new art , born after his own birth it so happened that porcius latro , a great friend from the elder seneca 's corduban childhood , became one of rome 's leading rhetoricians in the augustan era 22 , 24 in his friend 's view latro 's only serious rival for supremacy among rome 's declaimers was the orator junius gallio , another close family connection of the senecas but the end of seneca 's tribute to him controversiae i pr 13 illustrates how both men inhabited a literary world far distant from cicero 's , one in which delight in neat contrasts and paradoxes had become all-consuming : 'no one ' wrote seneca of latro , 'was more in command of his intellect : no one was more indulgent towards it ' in the prefaces to the books of controversiae seneca took pains to identify their distinguishing characteristics and was by no means entirely dismissive of those who fell short of his latronian ideal out of the ten books of controversiae , in which extracts from declamatory treatments of seventy-four judicial themes were presented , only books 1 , 2 , 7 , 9 , 10 survive more or less in their entirety , with the names of individual rhetoricians and seneca 's critical comments included seneca was also the author of a lost historical work , containing the history of rome from the beginning of the civil wars almost down to his own death , after which it was published by his son works by seneca the elder at perseus digital library seneca , suasoriae - english translation by w.a

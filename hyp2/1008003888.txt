in the renaissance his name and his works became confused with his son seneca the younger he noted that two of the elder seneca 's grandsons were called marcus and since there was a roman custom for boys to be given the name of their grandfather , raphael adopted the name of marcus for the elder seneca the elder seneca was born in spain at a date sufficiently early that he might , theoretically , have heard the voice of cicero , had he been living in italy as a boy instead , he was confined by wartime conditions 'within the walls ' of his 'own colony ' , controversiae 1 pr 11 and it was presumably there that he received his first schooling from a praeceptor who had more than two hundred pupils rather the testimony of the younger seneca in a fragment from his de vita patris , suggests that his father remained all his life a private gentleman , declining to seek fame from his writing of a history of rome 'from the beginning of the civil wars ' , on which he was still engaged at the time of his death under the regime of caligula it emerges from some of the elder seneca 's own words controversiae 2 pr it was on the basis of his experiences in the schools and auditoria of the declaimers of augustan and tiberian rome that the elder seneca wrote , in his old age , the work on which his fame rests today , the oratorum et rhetorum sententiae divisiones colores this work , originally comprising ten books on the subject of controversiae ( fictitious lawsuits ) together with at least one additional book on suasoriae ( fictitious speeches of persuasion ) , was written ostensibly at the request of his sons and ostensibly from memory it is not a collection of his own declamations , or of complete fair copies of those delivered by any other declaimer but instead it presents representative extracts and analyses of the declamatory art of a considerable number of the rhetorical celebrities of his younger days the declaimers of augustan and tiberian rome professed admiration for cicero , but their preferred oratorical style was not very ciceronian and nor was the theoretical basis of their educational method if its characteristic concentration on the bizarre kind of imaginary lawsuits known as controversiae had earlier precedent in the schools somewhere in the greek-speaking world - as is likely , in view of the remoteness of the subject-matter and legal suppositions of these declamatory themes from the realities of roman law-courts - seneca the elder seems to have been totally unaware of it it so happened that porcius latro , a great friend from the elder seneca 's corduban childhood , became one of rome 's leading rhetoricians in the augustan era but the end of seneca 's tribute to him controversiae i pr 13 illustrates how both men inhabited a literary world far distant from cicero 's , one in which delight in neat contrasts and paradoxes had become all-consuming : 'no one ' wrote seneca of latro , 'was more in command of his intellect : no one was more indulgent towards it ' in the prefaces to the books of controversiae seneca took pains to identify their distinguishing characteristics and was by no means entirely dismissive of those who fell short of his latronian ideal one should note the inclusion , in this distinguished group , alongside latro , gallio and albucius silus , of arellius fuscus , about whose style he expresses serious reservations in his second preface , for its unevenness and , in particular , with regard to the descriptive passages ( explicationes ) oxford latin dictionary sv 24 ; 4 pr 1 ; fairweather 29-30 each preface presents pen-portraits of the famous exponents of the declamatory art either individually , or in pairs , before finally , in the tenth preface , seneca offers his readers a group-presentation of declaimers previously overlooked 3 'an opinion expressed in the senate in response to an interrogatio/ adopted by the various declaimers about their set themes , while the second section is devoted to divisiones , outlines of their argumentation , and the third to colores , the specious interpretations which they gave to the actions of their imaginary defendants , with a view to excusing or vilifying them seneca was also the author of a lost historical work , containing the history of rome from the beginning of the civil wars almost down to his own death , after which it was published by his son works by seneca the elder at perseus digital library seneca , suasoriae - english translation by w.a

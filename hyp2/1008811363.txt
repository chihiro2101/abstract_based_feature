from tales of the life and courage of the pious and great prince alexander found in the second pskovian chronicle , circa 1260–1280 , comes one of the first known references to the great prince : '' by the will of god , prince alexander was born from the charitable , people-loving , and meek the great prince yaroslav , and his mother was theodosia he was taller than others and his voice reached the people as a trumpet , and his face was like the face of joseph , whom the egyptian pharaoh placed as next to the king after him of egypt born in pereslavl-zalessky , alexander was the second son of prince yaroslav vsevolodovich and feodosia igorevna of ryazan in 1236 , however , the novgorodians summoned him to become knyaz ( or prince ) of novgorod and , as their military leader , to defend their northwest lands from swedish and german invaders according to the novgorod chronicle written in the 14th century ( more than a century after the events it recorded ) , the swedish army had landed at the confluence of the rivers izhora and neva , alexander and his small army suddenly attacked the swedes on 15 july 1240 and defeated them the chronicle identifies the alleged swedish commander as '' spiridon '' while names after saint spyridon appear in both west and east , it is by far much more common in orthodox lands than scandinavia in this situation , it seems unlikely that sweden could have been able to organize a major expedition against novgorod after crusading catholic germans and estonians under the livonian order invaded pskov , the novgorod authorities sent for alexander alexander led his army to finland and successfully routed the swedes , who had made another attempt to block the baltic sea from the russians in 1256 he dismissed the roman curia 's attempts to cause war between russia and the golden horde , because he understood the uselessness of such war with the tatars at a time when they were still a powerful force historians seem to be unsure about alexander 's behavior when it came to his relations with mongols he may have thought that catholicism presented a more tangible threat to russian national identity than paying a tribute to the khan , who had little interest in slav religion and culture it is also argued that he intentionally kept the north slav principalities and city states as vassals to the mongols in order to preserve his own status and counted on the befriended horde in case someone challenged his authority ( he forced the citizens of novgorod to pay tribute ) alexander tried to strengthen his authority at the expense of the boyars and at the same time suppress any anti-mongol uprisings in the country ( novgorod uprising of 1259 ) according to one interpretation , alexander 's intentions were to protect scattered principalities of what would become muscovy from repeated invasions by the mongol army upon the conquest of the principality of vladimir by the mongols in 1238 , its reigning prince , yuri ii vsevolodovich , was killed in the battle of the sit river ; his younger brother , yaroslav ii vsevolodovich , requested from , and received from , the mongol khan installation as the new prince once möngke became the new great khan in 1251 , all the russian princes were obliged to travel to sarai on the volga , the capital of the golden horde , to be affirmed in their duchies , but andrei refused to go thanks to his friendship with sartaq khan , the subsequent invasion by the mongol golden horde saw andrei exiled to sweden and alexander installed as the grand prince of vladimir ( i.e in 1259 he led an army to the city of novgorod and forced it to pay tribute it had previously refused to the golden horde from the second pskovian chronicle : '' returning from the golden horde , the great prince alexander , reached the city of nizhny novgorod , and remained there for several days in good health , but when he reached the city of gorodets he fell ill great prince alexander , who was always firm in his faith in god , gave up this worldly kingdom and then he gave up his soul to god and died in peace on 12 november 1263 , on the day when the holy apostle philip is remembered at this burial metropolitan archbishop cyril said , 'my children , you should know that the sun of the suzdalian land has set during the great patriotic war , on 29 july 1942 , the soviet authorities introduced an order of alexander nevsky to revive the memory of alexander 's struggle with the germans repose of saint alexander nevsky orthodox icon and synaxarion ( 23 november ) alexander nevsky : politics under mongol domination synaxis of the saints of rostov and yaroslavl ( 23 may ) translation of the relics of saint alexander nevsky ( 30 august ) saint alexander on nevsky prospekt

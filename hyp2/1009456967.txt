alexander holevo publishes a paper showing that n qubits can carry more than n classical bits of information , but at most n classical bits are accessible ( a result known as '' holevo 's theorem '' or '' holevo 's bound '' ) poplavskii publishes '' thermodynamical models of information processing '' ( in russian ) which showed the computational infeasibility of simulating quantum systems on classical computers , due to the superposition principle paul benioff describes the first quantum mechanical model of a computer in this work , benioff showed that a computer could operate under the laws of quantum mechanics by describing a schrödinger equation description of turing machines , laying a foundation for further work in quantum computing benioff 's built on his earlier 1980 work showing that a computer can operate under the laws of quantum mechanics in feynman 's talk , he observed that it appeared to be impossible to efficiently simulate an evolution of a quantum system on a classical computer , and he proposed a basic model for a quantum computer paul benioff further develops his original model of a quantum mechanical turing machine david deutsch , at the university of oxford , describes the first universal quantum computer just as a universal turing machine can simulate any other turing machine efficiently ( church-turing thesis ) , so the universal quantum computer is able to simulate any other quantum computer with at most a polynomial slowdown igeta propose the first physical realization of a quantum computer , including feynman 's cnot gate artur ekert at the university of oxford , expands on the original proposal by david deutsch , for entanglement-based secure communication this was perhaps the earliest result in the computational complexity of quantum computers , proving that they were capable of performing some well-defined computational task more efficiently than any classical computer dan simon , at université de montréal , invents an oracle problem for which a quantum computer would be exponential growth than a conventional computer isaac chuang and yoshihisa yamamoto ( scientist ) propose a quantum-optical realization of a quantum computer to implement deutsch 's algorithm in december , ignacio cirac , at university of castilla-la mancha at ciudad real , and peter zoller at the university of innsbruck propose an experimental realization of the controlled-not gate with cold trapped ions the first united states department of defense workshop on quantum computing and quantum cryptography is organized by united states army physicists charles m divincenzo , '' quantum computation with quantum dots '' , phys first experimental demonstration of a quantum algorithm chuang at ibm 's almaden research center and mark kubinec and the university of california , berkeley together with coworkers at stanford university and mit daniel gottesman and emanuel knill independently prove that a certain subclass of quantum computations can be efficiently emulated with classical resources ( gottesman–knill theorem ) gabriel aeppli , thomas felix rosenbaum and colleagues demonstrate experimentally the basic concepts of quantum annealing in a condensed matter system the standard textbook , quantum computation and quantum information , by michael nielsen and isaac chuang is published the number 15 was factored using 10 18 identical molecules , each containing seven active nuclear spins noah linden and sandu popescu proved that the presence of entanglement is a necessary condition for a large class of quantum protocols robert raussendorf and hans jürgen briegel propose one-way quantum computer the quantum information science and technology roadmapping project , involving some of the main participants in the field , laid out the quantum computation roadmap implementation of the deutsch–jozsa algorithm on an ion-trap quantum computer at the university of innsbruck todd d pittman and collaborators at johns hopkins university , applied physics laboratory and independently jeremy o'brien and collaborators at the university of queensland , demonstrate quantum controlled-not gates using only linear optical elements university of illinois at urbana–champaign scientists demonstrate quantum entanglement of multiple characteristics , potentially allowing multiple qubits per particle the methods could be used to measure the state of quantum bits in a quantum computer without disturbing the state in december , the first quantum byte , or qubyte , is announced to have been created by scientists at the institute for quantum optics and quantum information and the university of innsbruck in austria materials science department of oxford university , cage a qubit in a '' buckyball '' ( a molecule of buckminsterfullerene ) , and demonstrated quantum '' bang-bang '' error correction vlatko vedral of the university of leeds and colleagues at the universities of porto and vienna found that the photons in ordinary laser light can be quantum mechanically entangled with the vibrations of a macroscopic mirror braunstein at the university of york along with the university of tokyo and the japan science and technology agency gave the first experimental demonstration of quantum telecloning february 16 , 2006 university of york professors at the university of sheffield

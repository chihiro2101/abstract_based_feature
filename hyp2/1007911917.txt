preserving animal skins has been practiced for a long time although embalming incorporates the use of lifelike poses , it is not considered taxidermy in the middle ages , crude examples of taxidermy were displayed by astrologers and apothecaries for a while , clay was used to shape some of the soft parts , but this made specimens heavy the term '' stuffing '' or a '' stuffed animal '' evolved from this crude form of taxidermy ward established one of the earliest taxidermy firms , rowland ward ltd however , the art of taxidermy remained relatively undeveloped , and the specimens that were created remained stiff and unconvincing english ornithologist john hancock is considered to be the father of modern taxidermy will go far towards raising the art of taxidermy to a level with other arts which have hitherto held higher pretensions '' taxidermists were also increasingly used by the bereaved owners of dead pets to 'resurrect ' them in the late 1800s a style known as anthropomorphic taxidermy became popular '' apart from the simulations of human situations , he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two-headed lambs and four-legged chickens other victorian taxidermists known for their iconic anthropomorphic taxidermy work are william hart and his son edward hart both william and edward created multiple sets of these dioramas additional modern uses of taxidermy have been the use of '' faux taxidermy '' or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy rogue taxidermy ( sometimes referred to as '' taxidermy art '' ) is a form of mixed media sculpture additionally , rogue taxidermy is not necessarily figurative , it can be abstract and does not need to resemble an animal neither the term , nor the genre , emerged from the world of traditional taxidermy depending on the type of skin , preserving chemicals are applied or the skin is tanned it is then either mounted on a mannequin made from wood , wool and wire , or a polyurethane form clay is used to install glass eyes and can also be used for facial features like cheekbones and a prominent brow bone ; shrinkage , warping , and wrinkling ) the process can be done with reptiles , birds , and small mammals such as cats , rodents , and some dogs the process is also time-consuming ; therefore , freeze drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal instead , detailed photos and measurements are taken of the animal so a taxidermist can create an exact replica in resin or fiberglass that can be displayed in place of the real animal a study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal 's skin , not the shape of the animal 's body as the name implies , study skins are used for scientific study ( research ) , and are housed mainly by museums since study skins are not prepared with aesthetics in mind they do not have imitation eyes like other taxidermy , and their cotton filling is visible in their eye openings

preserving animal skins has been practiced for a long time although embalming incorporates the use of lifelike poses , it is not considered taxidermy in the middle ages , crude examples of taxidermy were displayed by astrologers and apothecaries the earliest methods of preservation of birds for cabinet of curiosities were published in 1748 by reaumur in france there were several pioneers of taxidermy in france , germany , denmark and england around this time for a while , clay was used to shape some of the soft parts , but this made specimens heavy the term '' stuffing '' or a '' stuffed animal '' evolved from this crude form of taxidermy this technique enabled the museum to build the greatest collection of birds in the world however , the art of taxidermy remained relatively undeveloped , and the specimens that were created remained stiff and unconvincing the golden age of taxidermy was during the victorian era , when mounted animals became a popular part of interior design and decor english ornithologist john hancock is considered to be the father of modern taxidermy an avid collector of birds , which he would shoot himself , he began modelling them with clay and casting in plaster for the great exhibition of 1851 in london , he mounted a series of stuffed birds as an exhibit in the late 1800s a style known as anthropomorphic taxidermy became popular '' apart from the simulations of human situations , he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two-headed lambs and four-legged chickens in the early 20th century , taxidermy was taken forward under the leadership of artists such as carl akeley , james l hornaday , coleman jonas , fredrick , and william kaempfer , and leon pray additional modern uses of taxidermy have been the use of '' faux taxidermy '' or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy rogue taxidermy ( sometimes referred to as '' taxidermy art '' ) is a form of mixed media sculpture rogue taxidermy art references traditional trophy or natural history museum taxidermy , but is not always constructed out of taxidermied animals , it can be constructed entirely from synthetic materials additionally , rogue taxidermy is not necessarily figurative , it can be abstract and does not need to resemble an animal it can be a small decorative object or a large-scale room-sized installation neither the term , nor the genre , emerged from the world of traditional taxidermy the genre was born from forms of fine art that utilize some of the components found in the construction of a traditional taxidermy mount regardless of how well a taxidermy mount is prepared , all taxidermy is susceptible to insect damage a study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal 's skin , not the shape of the animal 's body since study skins are not prepared with aesthetics in mind they do not have imitation eyes like other taxidermy , and their cotton filling is visible in their eye openings

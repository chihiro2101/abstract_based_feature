preserving animal skins has been practiced for a long time although embalming incorporates the use of lifelike poses , it is not considered taxidermy in the middle ages , crude examples of taxidermy were displayed by astrologers and apothecaries the earliest methods of preservation of birds for cabinet of curiosities were published in 1748 by reaumur in france there were several pioneers of taxidermy in france , germany , denmark and england around this time the term '' stuffing '' or a '' stuffed animal '' evolved from this crude form of taxidermy however , the art of taxidermy remained relatively undeveloped , and the specimens that were created remained stiff and unconvincing the golden age of taxidermy was during the victorian era , when mounted animals became a popular part of interior design and decor english ornithologist john hancock is considered to be the father of modern taxidermy an avid collector of birds , which he would shoot himself , he began modelling them with clay and casting in plaster they generated much interest among the public and scientists alike who considered them as superior to earlier models and were regarded as the first lifelike and artistic specimens on display will go far towards raising the art of taxidermy to a level with other arts which have hitherto held higher pretensions '' hancock 's display sparked great national interest in taxidermy , and amateur and professional collections for public view proliferated rapidly in the late 1800s a style known as anthropomorphic taxidermy became popular the best-known practitioner in this genre was the english taxidermist walter potter , whose most famous work was the death and burial of cock robin potter 's museum was so popular that an extension was built to the platform at bramber railway station other victorian taxidermists known for their iconic anthropomorphic taxidermy work are william hart and his son edward hart in the early 20th century , taxidermy was taken forward under the leadership of artists such as carl akeley , james l additional modern uses of taxidermy have been the use of '' faux taxidermy '' or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy rogue taxidermy ( sometimes referred to as '' taxidermy art '' ) is a form of mixed media sculpture rogue taxidermy art references traditional trophy or natural history museum taxidermy , but is not always constructed out of taxidermied animals , it can be constructed entirely from synthetic materials additionally , rogue taxidermy is not necessarily figurative , it can be abstract and does not need to resemble an animal the genre was born from forms of fine art that utilize some of the components found in the construction of a traditional taxidermy mount the term '' rogue taxidermy '' was coined in 2004 by an artist collective called the minnesota association of rogue taxidermists clay is used to install glass eyes and can also be used for facial features like cheekbones and a prominent brow bone a study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal 's skin , not the shape of the animal 's body a study skin 's sole purpose is to preserve data , not to replicate an animal in a lifelike state

preserving animal skins has been practiced for a long time there were several pioneers of taxidermy in france , germany , denmark and england around this time in the 19th century , hunters began bringing their trophies to upholstery shops , where the upholsterers would actually sew up the animal skins and stuff them with rags and cotton the term '' stuffing '' or a '' stuffed animal '' evolved from this crude form of taxidermy in france , louis dufresne , taxidermist at the muséum national d'histoire naturelle from 1793 , popularized arsenical soap in an article in nouveau dictionnaire d'histoire naturelle ( 1803–1804 ) the golden age of taxidermy was during the victorian era , when mounted animals became a popular part of interior design and decor english ornithologist john hancock is considered to be the father of modern taxidermy the best-known practitioner in this genre was the english taxidermist walter potter , whose most famous work was the death and burial of cock robin one 4-piece set of boxing squirrel dioramas ( circa 1850 ) sold at auction in 2013 for record prices the set was one of a number they created over the years featuring boxing squirrels in the early 20th century , taxidermy was taken forward under the leadership of artists such as carl akeley , james l these and other taxidermists developed anatomically accurate figures which incorporated every detail in artistically interesting poses , with mounts in realistic settings and poses that were considered more appropriate for the species additional modern uses of taxidermy have been the use of '' faux taxidermy '' or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy decorating with sculpted fake animal heads that are painted in different colors has become a popular trend in interior design rogue taxidermy ( sometimes referred to as '' taxidermy art '' ) is a form of mixed media sculpture rogue taxidermy art references traditional trophy or natural history museum taxidermy , but is not always constructed out of taxidermied animals , it can be constructed entirely from synthetic materials additionally , rogue taxidermy is not necessarily figurative , it can be abstract and does not need to resemble an animal '' rogue taxidermy '' describes a wide variety of work , including work that is classified and exhibited as fine art the genre was born from forms of fine art that utilize some of the components found in the construction of a traditional taxidermy mount the term '' rogue taxidermy '' was coined in 2004 by an artist collective called the minnesota association of rogue taxidermists interest in the collective 's work gave rise to an artistic movement referred to as the rogue taxidermy art movement , or alternately , the taxidermy art movement mounting an animal has long been considered an art form , often involving months of work ; not all modern taxidermists trap or hunt for prized specimens another method is to mould the carcass in plaster , and then make a copy of the animal using one of several methods while the animal is unconscious , the hunter poses for photos with the animal while it is measured for the purpose of creating a replica , or to establish what size of prefabricated fiberglass trophy head can be purchased to most closely approximate the actual animal a study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal 's skin , not the shape of the animal 's body since study skins are not prepared with aesthetics in mind they do not have imitation eyes like other taxidermy , and their cotton filling is visible in their eye openings measurements are collected file:2013-03 naturkundemuseum berlin taxidermie eichhörnchen sciurus vulgaris anagoria 1.jpg 2

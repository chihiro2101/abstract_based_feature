in 2002 , star trek : deep space nine producer ira steven behr stated that unlike some plots , which originated from a single small idea , the creation of the dominion villain and story arc was '' very much thought out '' behr said that the earliest mention of the dominion was purposely planted in the comic season two ferengi episode , '' rules of acquisition '' , to leave the audience with an impression of '' how important could it be ? '' it was decided that the gamma quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the alpha quadrant after 18 months of deep space nine exposition , the producers decided to characterize the dominion as '' anti-federation '' instead of introducing one alien race , three were introduced simultaneously : the changelings , the vorta , and the jem'hadar executive producer michael piller suggested the idea that the founders of the dominion be the race to which odo belongs , toward the end of season two production , and discovered that behr and wolfe had also discussed this possibility piller asserts the endeavor to create a new villain was one of the most difficult tasks he undertook in his work on star trek wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional founders and the romulan empire , in that the species first uses diplomacy , deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion the dominion was established between two thousand and ten thousand years before the events of star trek : deep space nine , by the changelings , a race of liquid lifeforms capable of shapeshifting , as a means of defending themselves against the widespread persecution they faced from humanoid races ( whom they called '' solids '' ) these changelings genetically engineered a series of slave races to act as the foot soldiers of their new empire , and were dubbed the founders by their new creations over 200 years before first contact with deep space nine , the changelings ' great link ( a planet in the gamma quadrant where changelings exist in their natural '' gelatinous '' form ) had sent out 100 changeling infants in containers throughout the universe in order to see how other ( alien ) races react to the presence of changelings in 2370 , jem'hadar troops annihilated numerous bajoran and federation colonies and ships in the gamma quadrant and captured commander benjamin sisko , as the dominion demanded the federation stay on their side of the '' anomaly '' the changelings justified their actions by the need to protect their species against persecution by '' solids '' , and also spoke of a duty and inclination to '' impose order on a chaotic universe '' as a result of the continued dominion threat , numerous alpha quadrant powers acted with increased preparations and paranoia , one expression of which was the romulan attempt to forcibly collapse the wormhole despite the dominion 's warnings , the federation continued to chart the gamma quadrant when the federation condemned the klingon attack on cardassia , gowron banished federation citizens from klingon space , recalled their ambassadors and withdrew from the khitomer accords the dominion gained a foothold in the alpha quadrant when gul dukat announced that the cardassian union was joining the dominion in 2373 open hostilities began a few months later , when the federation mined the wormhole to prevent further dominion ships from arriving in response , the dominion attacked and captured deep space nine while a federation and klingon task force destroyed a dominion shipyard forced to move early because of intelligence that the dominion was on the verge of taking down the minefield , the federation departed before a full force could be assembled and found themselves blocked and outnumbered by a dominion-cardassian fleet through successful subterfuge , the romulan star empire was tricked into allying with the other two alpha quadrant powers , as a response to rumors that the dominion had plans to attack their empire with the three races united against them , the dominion was forced back once more , with the new alliance even seizing the cardassian planet of chin'toka ( the planet with the largest dominion communications array , allowing the alliance to tap into dominion communications ) odo then begins attempting to change the nature of the dominion by convincing the founders to re-evaluate their views on other species , as well as encouraging certain vorta and jem'hadar to behave more independently the dominion also make an appearance in star trek : conquest as one of the major races and have three ship types : a jem'hadar scout , a jem'hadar cruiser and a jem'hadar battleship

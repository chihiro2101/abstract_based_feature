in 2002 , star trek : deep space nine producer ira steven behr stated that unlike some plots , which originated from a single small idea , the creation of the dominion villain and story arc was '' very much thought out '' behr said that the earliest mention of the dominion was purposely planted in the comic season two ferengi episode , '' rules of acquisition '' , to leave the audience with an impression of '' how important could it be ? '' it was decided that the gamma quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the alpha quadrant the producers wanted to portray the region as something other than '' uncharted space '' , and avoid imitating the adventures of star trek : the next generation with another series of plots focusing primarily on themes of exploration after 18 months of deep space nine exposition , the producers decided to characterize the dominion as '' anti-federation '' writer and script editor robert hewitt wolfe has explained that this move also distinguished deep space nine from its successor series , star trek : voyager , which stars a lost federation ship traversing the chaotic and divided delta quadrant of the milky way executive producer michael piller suggested the idea that the founders of the dominion be the race to which odo belongs , toward the end of season two production , and discovered that behr and wolfe had also discussed this possibility wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional founders and the romulan empire , in that the species first uses diplomacy , deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion wolfe also characterized the dominion as a '' carrot and stick '' empire , with the vorta offering the carrot and the jem'hadar holding the stick the dominion was established between two thousand and ten thousand years before the events of star trek : deep space nine , by the changelings , a race of liquid lifeforms capable of shapeshifting , as a means of defending themselves against the widespread persecution they faced from humanoid races ( whom they called '' solids '' ) these changelings genetically engineered a series of slave races to act as the foot soldiers of their new empire , and were dubbed the founders by their new creations the dominion was unknown to the alpha quadrant powers until the discovery of the bajoran wormhole in 2369 , which facilitated exploration of the gamma quadrant in 2370 , jem'hadar troops annihilated numerous bajoran and federation colonies and ships in the gamma quadrant and captured commander benjamin sisko , as the dominion demanded the federation stay on their side of the '' anomaly '' a federation mission the next year to find and make peace with the founders ended disastrously , when the peace expedition was captured and subjected to hallucinogenic manipulation to test the willingness of the federation to appease the dominion in 2371 , the combined intelligence organizations of the cardassian and romulan attempted a strike into the gamma quadrant with a cloaked fleet , seeking to destroy the founders ' homeworld and cripple the dominion this failure weakened the cardassians and romulans and paved the way for dominion intrusion into the alpha quadrant the changeling later sabotages the defiant and reprograms it to target the tzenkethi in the hopes that the attack on the tzenkethi will cause an outbreak of war , allowing the dominion to conquer the alpha quadrant the dominion gained a foothold in the alpha quadrant when gul dukat announced that the cardassian union was joining the dominion in 2373 in response , the dominion attacked and captured deep space nine while a federation and klingon task force destroyed a dominion shipyard forced to move early because of intelligence that the dominion was on the verge of taking down the minefield , the federation departed before a full force could be assembled and found themselves blocked and outnumbered by a dominion-cardassian fleet later , the breen helped the dominion and the cardassians take back the cardassian planet chin'toka from the alliance odo then begins attempting to change the nature of the dominion by convincing the founders to re-evaluate their views on other species , as well as encouraging certain vorta and jem'hadar to behave more independently the dominion also make an appearance in star trek : conquest as one of the major races and have three ship types : a jem'hadar scout , a jem'hadar cruiser and a jem'hadar battleship the star trek online game also features appearances by the dominion , including several playable dominion ships and characters

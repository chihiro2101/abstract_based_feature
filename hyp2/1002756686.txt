in 2002 , star trek : deep space nine producer ira steven behr stated that unlike some plots , which originated from a single small idea , the creation of the dominion villain and story arc was '' very much thought out '' behr said that the earliest mention of the dominion was purposely planted in the comic season two ferengi episode , '' rules of acquisition '' , to leave the audience with an impression of '' how important could it be ? '' it was decided that the gamma quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the alpha quadrant the producers wanted to portray the region as something other than '' uncharted space '' , and avoid imitating the adventures of star trek : the next generation with another series of plots focusing primarily on themes of exploration after 18 months of deep space nine exposition , the producers decided to characterize the dominion as '' anti-federation '' writer and script editor robert hewitt wolfe has explained that this move also distinguished deep space nine from its successor series , star trek : voyager , which stars a lost federation ship traversing the chaotic and divided delta quadrant of the milky way instead of introducing one alien race , three were introduced simultaneously : the changelings , the vorta , and the jem'hadar executive producer michael piller suggested the idea that the founders of the dominion be the race to which odo belongs , toward the end of season two production , and discovered that behr and wolfe had also discussed this possibility piller asserts the endeavor to create a new villain was one of the most difficult tasks he undertook in his work on star trek wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional founders and the romulan empire , in that the species first uses diplomacy , deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion wolfe also characterized the dominion as a '' carrot and stick '' empire , with the vorta offering the carrot and the jem'hadar holding the stick these changelings genetically engineered a series of slave races to act as the foot soldiers of their new empire , and were dubbed the founders by their new creations over 200 years before first contact with deep space nine , the changelings ' great link ( a planet in the gamma quadrant where changelings exist in their natural '' gelatinous '' form ) had sent out 100 changeling infants in containers throughout the universe in order to see how other ( alien ) races react to the presence of changelings the dominion was unknown to the alpha quadrant powers until the discovery of the bajoran wormhole in 2369 , which facilitated exploration of the gamma quadrant in 2370 , jem'hadar troops annihilated numerous bajoran and federation colonies and ships in the gamma quadrant and captured commander benjamin sisko , as the dominion demanded the federation stay on their side of the '' anomaly '' as a result of this incident , the federation pulled the uss defiant out of storage ( which was originally designed to combat the borg ) , complete with a romulan cloaking device , and began preparations for a drastic increase in deep space nine 's defensive capabilities as a result of the continued dominion threat , numerous alpha quadrant powers acted with increased preparations and paranoia , one expression of which was the romulan attempt to forcibly collapse the wormhole in 2371 , the combined intelligence organizations of the cardassian and romulan attempted a strike into the gamma quadrant with a cloaked fleet , seeking to destroy the founders ' homeworld and cripple the dominion this failure weakened the cardassians and romulans and paved the way for dominion intrusion into the alpha quadrant after hours of fighting , dominion ships were outflanked by the arrival of a large klingon fleet , which won the running battle and allowed the defiant to break through to deep space nine with the three races united against them , the dominion was forced back once more , with the new alliance even seizing the cardassian planet of chin'toka ( the planet with the largest dominion communications array , allowing the alliance to tap into dominion communications ) odo then begins attempting to change the nature of the dominion by convincing the founders to re-evaluate their views on other species , as well as encouraging certain vorta and jem'hadar to behave more independently the dominion also make an appearance in star trek : conquest as one of the major races and have three ship types : a jem'hadar scout , a jem'hadar cruiser and a jem'hadar battleship the mirror universe version of the dominion appears in david mack 's novel star trek : section 31 - disavowed , published in 2014

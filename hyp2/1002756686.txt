in 2002 , star trek : deep space nine producer ira steven behr stated that unlike some plots , which originated from a single small idea , the creation of the dominion villain and story arc was '' very much thought out '' behr said that the earliest mention of the dominion was purposely planted in the comic season two ferengi episode , '' rules of acquisition '' , to leave the audience with an impression of '' how important could it be ? '' it was decided that the gamma quadrant would need an ambience that would distinguish it from the alpha quadrant after 18 months of deep space nine exposition , the producers decided to characterize the dominion as '' anti-federation '' writer and script editor robert hewitt wolfe has explained that this move also distinguished deep space nine from its successor series , star trek : voyager , which stars a lost federation ship traversing the chaotic and divided delta quadrant of the milky way instead of introducing one alien race , three were introduced simultaneously : the changelings , the vorta , and the jem'hadar executive producer michael piller suggested the idea that the founders of the dominion be the race to which odo belongs , toward the end of season two production , and discovered that behr and wolfe had also discussed this possibility wolfe also characterized the dominion as a '' carrot and stick '' empire , with the vorta offering the carrot and the jem'hadar holding the stick the dominion was established between two thousand and ten thousand years before the events of star trek : deep space nine , by the changelings , a race of liquid lifeforms capable of shapeshifting , as a means of defending themselves against the widespread persecution they faced from humanoid races ( whom they called '' solids '' ) these changelings genetically engineered a series of slave races to act as the foot soldiers of their new empire , and were dubbed the founders by their new creations over 200 years before first contact with deep space nine , the changelings ' great link ( a planet in the gamma quadrant where changelings exist in their natural '' gelatinous '' form ) had sent out 100 changeling infants in containers throughout the universe in order to see how other ( alien ) races react to the presence of changelings ( '' vortex '' ) infant changeling the dominion was unknown to the alpha quadrant powers until the discovery of the bajoran wormhole in 2369 , which facilitated exploration of the gamma quadrant a federation starship , the uss odyssey , was destroyed by a kamikaze attack after the federation rescued sisko , as the dominion demonstrated not only an ability to penetrate shielding , but a fanatical devotion to their cause as the suicide attack was made on a retreating ship , solely to drive the point home to the federation as a result of this incident , the federation pulled the uss defiant out of storage ( which was originally designed to combat the borg ) , complete with a romulan cloaking device , and began preparations for a drastic increase in deep space nine 's defensive capabilities in 2371 , the combined intelligence organizations of the cardassian and romulan attempted a strike into the gamma quadrant with a cloaked fleet , seeking to destroy the founders ' homeworld and cripple the dominion a changeling impersonates federation ambassador krajensky and informs newly promoted captain sisko that there was a coup on tzenketh the changeling later sabotages the defiant and reprograms it to target the tzenkethi in the hopes that the attack on the tzenkethi will cause an outbreak of war , allowing the dominion to conquer the alpha quadrant the dominion gained a foothold in the alpha quadrant when gul dukat announced that the cardassian union was joining the dominion in 2373 forced to move early because of intelligence that the dominion was on the verge of taking down the minefield , the federation departed before a full force could be assembled and found themselves blocked and outnumbered by a dominion-cardassian fleet with the three races united against them , the dominion was forced back once more , with the new alliance even seizing the cardassian planet of chin'toka ( the planet with the largest dominion communications array , allowing the alliance to tap into dominion communications ) odo then begins attempting to change the nature of the dominion by convincing the founders to re-evaluate their views on other species , as well as encouraging certain vorta and jem'hadar to behave more independently the star trek online game also features appearances by the dominion , including several playable dominion ships and characters it continues the story of the dominion fleet lost in the wormhole , the changeling laas and the fate of the founder leader after the dominion war

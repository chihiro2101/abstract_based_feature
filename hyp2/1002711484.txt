ivan krylov was born in moscow , but spent his early years in orenburg and tver his literary career began in 1783 , when he sold to a publisher the comedy “ the coffee-grounds fortune teller ” ( kofeynitsa ) that he had written at 14 , although in the end it was never published or produced by 1806 he had arrived in moscow , where he showed the poet and fabulist ivan dmitriev his translation of two of jean de la fontaine 's fables , “ the oak and the reed ” and “ the choosy bride ” , and was encouraged by him to write more krylov 's first collection of fables , 23 in number , appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing portraits of krylov began to be painted almost as soon as the fame of his fables spread , beginning in 1812 with roman m volkov 's somewhat conventional depiction of the poet with one hand leaning on books and the other grasping a quill as he stares into space , seeking inspiration regarded as a sign of the progress of romanticism in russian official culture , it was the first monument to a poet erected in eastern europe the sculptor peter clodt seats his massive figure on a tall pedestal surrounded on all sides by tumultuous reliefs designed by alexander agin that represent scenes from the fables russian academic dictionary later monuments chose to represent individual fables separately from the main statue of the poet it was erected on the centenary of krylov 's death in 1944 and represents the poet standing and looking down an alley lined with metal reliefs of the fables mounted on plinths the seated statue of the fabulist is surrounded by twelve stylised reliefs of the fables in adjoining avenues the two were friends and pushkin modified krylov 's description of 'an ass of most honest principles ' ( '' the ass and the peasant '' ) to provide the opening of his romantic novel in verse , eugene onegin so well known were krylov 's fables that readers were immediately alerted by its first line , 'my uncle , of most honest principles' in the case of '' the grandee '' ( 1835 ) , it was only allowed to be published after it became known that krylov had amused the emperor by reading it to him , ralston , p.13 while others did not see the light until long after his death , such as '' the speckled sheep '' , published in 1867 , and '' the feast '' in 1869 ralston , p.248 beside the fables of la fontaine , and one or two others , the germ of some of krylov 's other fables can be found in aesop , but always with his own witty touch and reinterpretation his animal fables blend naturalistic characterization of the animal with an allegorical portrayal of basic human types ; they span individual foibles as well as difficult interpersonal relations belling the cat uses another fable of la fontaine ( ii.2 ) only for scene-setting the connection between krylov 's '' the two boys '' harrison , p.220 and la fontaine 's the monkey and the cat is even thinner though both fables concern being made the dupe of another , krylov tells of how one boy , rather than picking chestnuts from the fire , supports another on his shoulders as he picks the nuts and receives only the rinds in return in his bibliographical and historical notes to the fables of krilof ( 1868 ) , the russian commentator v.f.kenevich sees the fable as referring to aesop 's “ the travellers and the plane tree ” illustrated books , on the other hand , have been numerous and at the start of the 20th century the style of other new art movements were applied to the fables there is an analysis of these in the exhaustive shostakovitch and a complete performance on youtube the dragonfly , a ballet based on the first of these fables , was created by leonid yakobson for performance at the bolshoi in 1947 but it was withdrawn at the last moment due to political infighting their fables were also the fruit of their mature years ; they were long meditated and then distilled in the language and form most appropriate to them but one might cite the opposite approach in krylov 's pithy summation of la fontaine 's lengthy '' the man who runs after fortune '' ( vii.12 ) in his own '' man and his shadow ''

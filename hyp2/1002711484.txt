ivan krylov was born in moscow , but spent his early years in orenburg and tver receiving a sixty ruble fee , he exchanged it for the works of molière , racine , and boileau and it was probably under their influence that he wrote his other plays , of which his philomela ( written in 1786 ) was not published until 1795 by 1806 he had arrived in moscow , where he showed the poet and fabulist ivan dmitriev his translation of two of jean de la fontaine 's fables , “ the oak and the reed ” and “ the choosy bride ” , and was encouraged by him to write more soon , however , he moved on to st petersburg and returned to play writing with more success , particularly with the productions of “ the fashion shop ” ( modnaya lavka ) and “ a lesson for the daughters ” ( urok dochkam ) krylov 's first collection of fables , 23 in number , appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing portraits of krylov began to be painted almost as soon as the fame of his fables spread , beginning in 1812 with roman m coxwell , p.10 a bust is also recorded as being placed on the table before krylov 's seat at the anniversary banquet held in his honour in 1838 shortly afterwards , he was included among other literary figures on the millennium of russia monument in veliky novgorod in 1862 russian academic dictionary later monuments chose to represent individual fables separately from the main statue of the poet it was erected on the centenary of krylov 's death in 1944 and represents the poet standing and looking down an alley lined with metal reliefs of the fables mounted on plinths this was the work of andrei drevin , daniel mitlyansky , and the architect a ; photographs of the reliefs appear on the another city site krylov shares yet another monument with the poet alexander pushkin in the city of pushkino 's soviet square the two were friends and pushkin modified krylov 's description of 'an ass of most honest principles ' ( '' the ass and the peasant '' ) to provide the opening of his romantic novel in verse , eugene onegin so well known were krylov 's fables that readers were immediately alerted by its first line , 'my uncle , of most honest principles' his fables were often rooted in historic events and are easily recognizable by their style of language and engaging story in the case of '' the grandee '' ( 1835 ) , it was only allowed to be published after it became known that krylov had amused the emperor by reading it to him , ralston , p.13 while others did not see the light until long after his death , such as '' the speckled sheep '' , published in 1867 , and '' the feast '' in 1869 ralston , p.248 beside the fables of la fontaine , and one or two others , the germ of some of krylov 's other fables can be found in aesop , but always with his own witty touch and reinterpretation many of krylov 's fables , especially those that satirize contemporary political situations , take their start from a well-known fable but then diverge to krylov 's approbation , with the ending of la fontaine 's fable in mind , the peasant kills it as untrustworthy the connection between krylov 's '' the two boys '' harrison , p.220 and la fontaine 's the monkey and the cat is even thinner establishing the original model of some fables is problematical , however , and there is disagreement over the source for krylov 's “ the swine under the oak ” krylov is sometimes referred to as 'the russian la fontaine ' because , though he was not the first of the russian fabulists , he became the foremost and is the one whose reputation has lasted , but the comparison between the two men can be extended further it has been observed that in general krylov tends to add more detail in contrast with la fontaine 's leaner versions and that , where la fontaine is an urbane moralist , krylov is satirical much the same can be said of his treatment of '' the fly and the bee '' ( la fontaine 's the fly and the ant , iv.3 ) and '' the wolf and the shepherds '' ( la fontaine 's x.6 ) , which dispense with the circumstantiality of the original and retain little more than the reasoning

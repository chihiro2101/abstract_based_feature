ivan krylov was born in moscow , but spent his early years in orenburg and tver a few years later krylov and his mother moved to st receiving a sixty ruble fee , he exchanged it for the works of molière , racine , and boileau and it was probably under their influence that he wrote his other plays , of which his philomela ( written in 1786 ) was not published until 1795 beginning in 1789 , krylov also made three attempts to start a literary magazine , although none achieved a large circulation or lasted more than a year by 1806 he had arrived in moscow , where he showed the poet and fabulist ivan dmitriev his translation of two of jean de la fontaine 's fables , “ the oak and the reed ” and “ the choosy bride ” , and was encouraged by him to write more krylov 's first collection of fables , 23 in number , appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing volkov 's somewhat conventional depiction of the poet with one hand leaning on books and the other grasping a quill as he stares into space , seeking inspiration coxwell , p.10 a bust is also recorded as being placed on the table before krylov 's seat at the anniversary banquet held in his honour in 1838 ralston p.xxxviii the most notable statue of him was placed in the summer garden ( 1854–55 ) ten years after his death the sculptor peter clodt seats his massive figure on a tall pedestal surrounded on all sides by tumultuous reliefs designed by alexander agin that represent scenes from the fables russian academic dictionary later monuments chose to represent individual fables separately from the main statue of the poet the two were friends and pushkin modified krylov 's description of 'an ass of most honest principles ' ( '' the ass and the peasant '' ) to provide the opening of his romantic novel in verse , eugene onegin so well known were krylov 's fables that readers were immediately alerted by its first line , 'my uncle , of most honest principles' by the time of krylov 's death , 77,000 copies of his fables had been sold in russia , and his unique brand of wisdom and humor has remained popular ever since his fables were often rooted in historic events and are easily recognizable by their style of language and engaging story though he began as a translator and imitator of existing fables , krylov soon showed himself an imaginative , prolific writer , who found abundant original material in his native land and in the burning issues of the day in russia his language is considered of high quality : his words and phrases are direct , simple and idiomatic , with color and cadence varying with the theme , many of them becoming actual idioms many of krylov 's fables , especially those that satirize contemporary political situations , take their start from a well-known fable but then diverge krylov et ses fables , paris 1869 , pp.127-8 in that some of the fables were applied as commentaries on actual historical situations , it is not surprising to find them reused in their turn in political caricatures this was followed in 1905 by 2 fables after krylov for mixed a cappella choir ( op.36 ) , including '' the frog and the ox '' and '' the swan , the pike and the crawfish '' it has been observed that in general krylov tends to add more detail in contrast with la fontaine 's leaner versions and that , where la fontaine is an urbane moralist , krylov is satirical but one might cite the opposite approach in krylov 's pithy summation of la fontaine 's lengthy '' the man who runs after fortune '' ( vii.12 ) in his own '' man and his shadow '' much the same can be said of his treatment of '' the fly and the bee '' ( la fontaine 's the fly and the ant , iv.3 ) and '' the wolf and the shepherds '' ( la fontaine 's x.6 ) , which dispense with the circumstantiality of the original and retain little more than the reasoning

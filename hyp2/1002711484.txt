ivan krylov was born in moscow , but spent his early years in orenburg and tver a few years later krylov and his mother moved to st receiving a sixty ruble fee , he exchanged it for the works of molière , racine , and boileau and it was probably under their influence that he wrote his other plays , of which his philomela ( written in 1786 ) was not published until 1795 beginning in 1789 , krylov also made three attempts to start a literary magazine , although none achieved a large circulation or lasted more than a year by 1806 he had arrived in moscow , where he showed the poet and fabulist ivan dmitriev his translation of two of jean de la fontaine 's fables , “ the oak and the reed ” and “ the choosy bride ” , and was encouraged by him to write more soon , however , he moved on to st petersburg and returned to play writing with more success , particularly with the productions of “ the fashion shop ” ( modnaya lavka ) and “ a lesson for the daughters ” ( urok dochkam ) krylov 's first collection of fables , 23 in number , appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing after his death in 1844 , he was buried beside his friend and fellow librarian nikolay gnedich in the tikhvin cemetery volkov 's somewhat conventional depiction of the poet with one hand leaning on books and the other grasping a quill as he stares into space , seeking inspiration coxwell , p.10 a bust is also recorded as being placed on the table before krylov 's seat at the anniversary banquet held in his honour in 1838 it was erected on the centenary of krylov 's death in 1944 and represents the poet standing and looking down an alley lined with metal reliefs of the fables mounted on plinths ; photographs of the reliefs appear on the another city site krylov shares yet another monument with the poet alexander pushkin in the city of pushkino 's soviet square his fables were often rooted in historic events and are easily recognizable by their style of language and engaging story ralston , p.248 beside the fables of la fontaine , and one or two others , the germ of some of krylov 's other fables can be found in aesop , but always with his own witty touch and reinterpretation in russia his language is considered of high quality : his words and phrases are direct , simple and idiomatic , with color and cadence varying with the theme , many of them becoming actual idioms his animal fables blend naturalistic characterization of the animal with an allegorical portrayal of basic human types ; they span individual foibles as well as difficult interpersonal relations many of krylov 's fables , especially those that satirize contemporary political situations , take their start from a well-known fable but then diverge though both fables concern being made the dupe of another , krylov tells of how one boy , rather than picking chestnuts from the fire , supports another on his shoulders as he picks the nuts and receives only the rinds in return in one of the mediaeval versions of the original story , the bird sings to save its nestlings but is too anxious to perform well establishing the original model of some fables is problematical , however , and there is disagreement over the source for krylov 's “ the swine under the oak ” two of those who took the subject up were andrei m.volkov ( 1829-1873 ) in 1857 , and andrei popov ( 1832–1896 ) in 1865 ( see left ) he was followed by alexander gretchaninov , who set 4 fables after ivan krylov for medium voice and piano ( op.33 ) , which included '' the musicians '' , '' the peasant and the sheep '' , '' the eagle and the bee '' , and '' the bear among the bees '' krylov is sometimes referred to as 'the russian la fontaine ' because , though he was not the first of the russian fabulists , he became the foremost and is the one whose reputation has lasted , but the comparison between the two men can be extended further it has been observed that in general krylov tends to add more detail in contrast with la fontaine 's leaner versions and that , where la fontaine is an urbane moralist , krylov is satirical

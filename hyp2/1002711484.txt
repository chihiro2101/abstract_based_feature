ivan krylov was born in moscow , but spent his early years in orenburg and tver there , krylov obtained a position in the civil service , but gave it up after his mother 's death in 1788 his literary career began in 1783 , when he sold to a publisher the comedy “ the coffee-grounds fortune teller ” ( kofeynitsa ) that he had written at 14 , although in the end it was never published or produced beginning in 1789 , krylov also made three attempts to start a literary magazine , although none achieved a large circulation or lasted more than a year little is known of him in the years immediately after , other than the commonly accepted myth that he wandered from town to town playing cards by 1806 he had arrived in moscow , where he showed the poet and fabulist ivan dmitriev his translation of two of jean de la fontaine 's fables , “ the oak and the reed ” and “ the choosy bride ” , and was encouraged by him to write more krylov 's first collection of fables , 23 in number , appeared in 1809 and met with such an enthusiastic reception that thereafter he abandoned drama for fable-writing from 1812 to 1841 he was employed by the imperial public library , first as an assistant , and then as head of the russian books department , a not very demanding position that left him plenty of time to write towards the end of his life krylov suffered two cerebral hemorrhages and was taken by the empress to recover at pavlovsk palace portraits of krylov began to be painted almost as soon as the fame of his fables spread , beginning in 1812 with roman m volkov 's somewhat conventional depiction of the poet with one hand leaning on books and the other grasping a quill as he stares into space , seeking inspiration russian academic dictionary later monuments chose to represent individual fables separately from the main statue of the poet it was erected on the centenary of krylov 's death in 1944 and represents the poet standing and looking down an alley lined with metal reliefs of the fables mounted on plinths ; photographs of the reliefs appear on the another city site krylov shares yet another monument with the poet alexander pushkin in the city of pushkino 's soviet square so well known were krylov 's fables that readers were immediately alerted by its first line , 'my uncle , of most honest principles' he is also commemorated in the numerous streets named after him in russia as well as in formerly soviet territories ralston , p.248 beside the fables of la fontaine , and one or two others , the germ of some of krylov 's other fables can be found in aesop , but always with his own witty touch and reinterpretation to krylov 's approbation , with the ending of la fontaine 's fable in mind , the peasant kills it as untrustworthy belling the cat uses another fable of la fontaine ( ii.2 ) only for scene-setting the connection between krylov 's '' the two boys '' harrison , p.220 and la fontaine 's the monkey and the cat is even thinner though both fables concern being made the dupe of another , krylov tells of how one boy , rather than picking chestnuts from the fire , supports another on his shoulders as he picks the nuts and receives only the rinds in return in 1911 heorhiy narbut provided attractive art nouveau silhouettes for 3 fables of krylov , which included '' the beggar and fortune '' ( see below ) and '' death and the peasant '' it has been observed that in general krylov tends to add more detail in contrast with la fontaine 's leaner versions and that , where la fontaine is an urbane moralist , krylov is satirical much the same can be said of his treatment of '' the fly and the bee '' ( la fontaine 's the fly and the ant , iv.3 ) and '' the wolf and the shepherds '' ( la fontaine 's x.6 ) , which dispense with the circumstantiality of the original and retain little more than the reasoning

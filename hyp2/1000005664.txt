the '' west lothian question '' itself was first posed in 1977 during a british house of commons debate about scottish and welsh devolution proposals in the 14 november sitting , tam dalyell , the labour mp for the scottish constituency of west lothian , asked , for how long will english constituencies and english honourable members tolerate & nbsp ; the name '' west lothian question '' was later coined by the ulster unionist mp enoch powell in a response to dalyell 's speech , when he said '' we have finally grasped what the honourable member for west lothian is getting at let us call it the west lothian question '' the question is more commonly assumed to refer to the anomaly that came into being in 1999 , with scottish , welsh and northern ireland members at westminster allowed to vote upon english matters , but mps for english constituencies having no influence on affairs which were devolved to scotland , wales or northern ireland no sovereign status on the scottish parliament is conferred , and the act has not changed the status of the westminster parliament as the supreme legislature of scotland , with westminster retaining the ability to override , or veto , any decisions taken by the scottish parliament the ability of all westminster mps to vote on scottish legislation has not been legally diminished by devolution , as made clear by section 28 ( 7 ) of the scotland act 1998 , which states that the legislative powers of the scottish parliament do '' not affect the power of the parliament of the united kingdom to make laws for scotland '' this is known as the sewel convention , and the related scottish parliamentary motions are now known as legislative consent motions ( previously sewel motions ) the sewel convention states that the westminster parliament will not normally legislate on devolved matters in scotland without first obtaining the consent of the scottish parliament the commission proposed that bills in the house of commons which affected england solely or differently should require a majority vote of mps representing english constituencies the conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election included a proposal that england-only legislation should require approval from a legislative grand committee prior to its third reading in the house of commons the labour government of tony blair attempted to address part of the west lothian question by introducing english regional assemblies with no legislative powers the scottish national party ( snp ) , which campaigns for scottish independence , won an outright majority in the scottish parliament in the 2011 scottish election during periods when the predominantly unionist mps from northern ireland deprived labour of working majorities , conservatives supported the principle that '' every member of the house of commons is equal to every other member of the house of commons ''

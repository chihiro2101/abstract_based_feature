the '' west lothian question '' itself was first posed in 1977 during a british house of commons debate about scottish and welsh devolution proposals at least 119 honourable members from scotland , wales and northern ireland exercising an important , and probably often decisive , effect on english politics while they themselves have no say in the same matters in scotland , wales and northern ireland ? to illustrate his point , dalyell chose the example of a member of parliament for west lothian who could vote on matters affecting the english town of blackburn ( in lancashire ) , but not on matters concerning the blackburn in his own constituency the name '' west lothian question '' was later coined by the ulster unionist mp enoch powell in a response to dalyell 's speech , when he said '' we have finally grasped what the honourable member for west lothian is getting at '' the question is more commonly assumed to refer to the anomaly that came into being in 1999 , with scottish , welsh and northern ireland members at westminster allowed to vote upon english matters , but mps for english constituencies having no influence on affairs which were devolved to scotland , wales or northern ireland no sovereign status on the scottish parliament is conferred , and the act has not changed the status of the westminster parliament as the supreme legislature of scotland , with westminster retaining the ability to override , or veto , any decisions taken by the scottish parliament during the 2000s a number of pieces of legislation which affected only or mainly england were passed by the uk parliament , although the votes cast by mps were such that the legislation would not have been passed if only the votes cast by mps representing english constituencies had been counted the opposition conservative party commissioned a report , '' devolution , the west lothian question and the future of the union '' , which proposed some procedural changes restricting the participation of mps representing non-english constituencies during the passage of bills relating only to england the commission proposed that bills in the house of commons which affected england solely or differently should require a majority vote of mps representing english constituencies the conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election included a proposal that england-only legislation should require approval from a legislative grand committee prior to its third reading in the house of commons having won a majority in that election , the conservative government used a change in standing orders in october 2015 to give mps representing english ( or english and welsh ) constituencies a '' veto '' over laws affecting only england ( or only england and wales ) thus , a new law can not be imposed only on england by a majority of all mps if a majority of english mps are opposed the labour government of tony blair attempted to address part of the west lothian question by introducing english regional assemblies with no legislative powers during the existence of the parliament of northern ireland ( 1922â€“1972 ) , the number of mps elected from northern ireland to westminster was below the standard ratio of mps compared with the rest of the uk during periods when the predominantly unionist mps from northern ireland deprived labour of working majorities , conservatives supported the principle that '' every member of the house of commons is equal to every other member of the house of commons ''

the '' west lothian question '' itself was first posed in 1977 during a british house of commons debate about scottish and welsh devolution proposals in the 14 november sitting , tam dalyell , the labour mp for the scottish constituency of west lothian , asked , for how long will english constituencies and english honourable members tolerate & nbsp ; the name '' west lothian question '' was later coined by the ulster unionist mp enoch powell in a response to dalyell 's speech , when he said '' we have finally grasped what the honourable member for west lothian is getting at '' the question is more commonly assumed to refer to the anomaly that came into being in 1999 , with scottish , welsh and northern ireland members at westminster allowed to vote upon english matters , but mps for english constituencies having no influence on affairs which were devolved to scotland , wales or northern ireland no sovereign status on the scottish parliament is conferred , and the act has not changed the status of the westminster parliament as the supreme legislature of scotland , with westminster retaining the ability to override , or veto , any decisions taken by the scottish parliament the ability of all westminster mps to vote on scottish legislation has not been legally diminished by devolution , as made clear by section 28 ( 7 ) of the scotland act 1998 , which states that the legislative powers of the scottish parliament do '' not affect the power of the parliament of the united kingdom to make laws for scotland '' during devolution , a convention was created to manage the power of westminster to legislate on matters within the legislative competence of the scottish parliament the commission proposed that bills in the house of commons which affected england solely or differently should require a majority vote of mps representing english constituencies thus , a new law can not be imposed only on england by a majority of all mps if a majority of english mps are opposed the westminster ( united kingdom ) parliament would continue to meet and legislate on matters of uk-wide competence such as defence , foreign affairs and economic matters with the parliaments of england , wales , scotland and northern ireland legislating locally '' peter hain , who campaigned for a welsh assembly , warned creating an english parliament or trying to stop scottish and welsh mps from voting on england-only matters would break up the union this would mean that the situation of scottish mps voting on policy which only affected england would no longer arise , because parliament would no longer be responsible for areas of policy which affected only england the scottish national party ( snp ) , which campaigns for scottish independence , won an outright majority in the scottish parliament in the 2011 scottish election barnett formula britishness campaign for an english parliament cornish self-government movement democratic deficit english nationalism federalism in the united kingdom asymmetric federalism proportional representation scottish independence sewel convention scottish mafia welsh nationalism

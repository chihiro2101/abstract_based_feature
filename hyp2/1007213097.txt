the earliest reference to a meal of the type referred to as agape is in paul the apostle 's first epistle to the corinthians , although the term can only be inferred vaguely from its prominence in 1 cor 13 many new testament scholars hold that the christians of corinth met in the evening and had a common meal including sacramental action over bread and wine perhaps predictably enough , it could at times deteriorate into merely an occasion for eating and drinking , or for ostentatious displays by the wealthier members of the community , as happened in corinth , drawing the criticisms of paul : '' i hear that when you come together as a church , there are divisions among you , and to some extent i believe it do n't you have homes to eat and drink in ? or do you despise the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing ? '' the term agape ( ἀγάπη ) is also used in reference to meals in and according to a few manuscripts of soon after the year 100 , ignatius of antioch refers to the agape feast in letter 97 to trajan , pliny the younger perhaps indicates , in about 112 , that such a meal was normally taken separately from the eucharistic celebration ( although he is silent about its nomenclature ) : he speaks of the christians separating after having offered prayer , on the morning of a fixed day , to christ as god , and reassembling later for a common meal another was the moravians led by count zinzendorf who adopted a form consisting of the sharing of a simple meal , and then testimony or a devotional address were given and letters from missionaries read the schwarzenau brethren groups ( the largest being the church of the brethren ) regularly practice agape feasts ( called '' love feast '' ) , which include feetwashing , a supper , and communion , with hymns and brief scriptural meditations interspersed throughout the worship service the term '' lovefeast '' in this case generally refers to all three ordinances , not just the meal influenced by german pietists during the early 18th century , the lovefeast was instituted among brethren before moravians adopted the practice the lovefeast of the moravian church is based on the agape feast and the meals of the early churches described in the bible in the acts of the apostles , which were partaken in unity and love a moravian congregation may hold a lovefeast on any special occasion , such as the date their church was founded , but there are certain established dates that lovefeasts are regularly observed one account from july 1776 expounded on attendees ' experiences of new birth and entire sanctification at a lovefeast : the liturgy for a lovefeast traditionally includes the following elements : in the wesleyan methodist church , lovefeasts consisted of bread and water that filled the loving-cup the creation seventh day adventists partake of an agape feast as a part of their new moon observances , taking the form of a formal , all-natural meal held after the communion supper

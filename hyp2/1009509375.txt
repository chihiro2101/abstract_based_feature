originally , vehicle registration was the responsibility of borough and county councils throughout great britain , a system created by the motor car act 1903 the licensing system was centralised in 1965 and administered from the driver and vehicle licensing centre ( dvlc ) in swansea in april 1990 , the dvlc was renamed as the driver and vehicle licensing agency ( dvla ) , becoming an executive agency of department for transport the vehicle register held by dvla is used in many ways the current dvla vehicle register was built by eds under a £5 million contract signed in 1996 , with a planned implementation date on october 1998 , though actual implementation was delayed by a year it uses a client–server architecture and uses the vehicle identification number , rather than the registration plate , as the primary key to track vehicles , eliminating the possibility of having multiple registrations for a single vehicle the vehicle identity check ( vic ) was introduced to help reduce vehicle crime an identity check might then be required before the vehicle tax could be renewed or before any amendments could be made to the logbook dvla database records are used by commercial vehicle check companies to offer a comprehensive individual car check to prospective purchasers the dvla sells details to companies for £2.50 , but it was found that the agency had sold some of these to a business which had been fined weeks before for unfair business practices customer satisfaction levels varied between 76 % to 97 % in the four categories surveyed ; vehicle registration , driver licence renewal , vehicle taxation , driver medical transactions

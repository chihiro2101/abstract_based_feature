offside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent team-mate to touch the ball being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage officiating decisions regarding offside , which can often be a matter of only centimetres or inches , can be critical in games , as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue , or even if a goal is allowed to stand the application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps : offside position , offside offence , and offside sanction thumb image : offsideballline.svg thumb 300px right the blue forward in the penalty area of the diagram is not in an offside position , as they are behind the ball , despite the fact that they are closer to the opponents ' goal line than the second-last opponent a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) '' an offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a direct free kick , indirect free kick , or dropped-ball since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence in an effort to avoid such criticisms , which were based on the fact that phrases such as '' interfering with play '' , '' interfering with an opponent '' , and '' gaining an advantage '' were not clearly defined , fifa issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003 ; and these were incorporated into law 11 in july 2005 the new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely , but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent this additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law , and forms the last 3 conditions under the heading '' interfering with an opponent '' as shown above the circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save , in the context of a ball that has '' been deliberately saved by any opponent the sanction for an offside offence is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred , even if it is in the player 's own half of the field of play in enforcing this rule , the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee , who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent , the ball , or the halfway line , whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end the risk of false judgement is further increased by the foreshortening effect , which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player , and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy : if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions , they can be two metres apart in less than a second it has been argued that human beings and technological media are incapable of accurately detecting an offside position quickly enough to make a timely decision in general , offside rules intend to prevent players from “ goal-hanging ” – staying near the opponent 's goal and waiting for the ball to be passed to then directly score a goal in contrast , the offside rules force players not to get ahead of the ball , and thus favour dribbling the ball and short passes over few long passes the novel tom brown 's school days , published in 1857 but based on the author 's experiences at rugby school from 1834 to 1842 , discussed that school 's offside law : emphasis added the first published set of laws of any code of football ( rugby school , 1845 ) , stated that '' a player is off his side if the ball has touched one of his own side behind him , until the other side touch it ( this is similar to the current offside law in rugby , under which any player between the ball and the opponent 's goal who takes part in play , is liable to be penalised ) in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line in contrast with the school and university games , surviving rules of independent football clubs from before 1860 tend to lack any offside law in a letter to the field in february 1867 , sheffield fc secretary harry chambers wrote that sheffield fc had adopted a rule at the beginning of the 1863 season requiring one opponent to be level or closer to the opponent 's goal he criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax : the rugby laws , for example , were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball , while eton 's rule of four allowed '' an immense amount of sneaking '' when the number of players was unlimited the opponents of hacking brought the delegates ' attention to the cambridge rules of 1863 ( which banned carrying and hacking ) : the law adopted by the fa was '' strict '' —i.e in 1990 , ifab altered the offside law so that an attacker who is level with the second-last defender would be considered onside , whereas previously such a player would have been considered offside in 2016 , it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself can not be in an offside position : part of the player 's head , body or feet must be within the opponent 's half of the field of play under the original laws of 1863 , it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in ; however , since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line , it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball now that changes to the interpretations of '' interfering with play , interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage '' mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play , players not involved in active play can not be '' caught offside '' , making the tactic riskier

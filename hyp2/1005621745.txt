offside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent team-mate to touch the ball being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play like fouls , however , any play ( such as the scoring of a goal ) that occurs after an offence has taken place , but before the referee is able to stop the play , is nullified the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage the offside rule limits attackers ' ability to do this , requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward one of the main duties of the assistant referees is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside — their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch assistant referees communicate that an offside offence has occurred by raising a signal flag the application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps : offside position , offside offence , and offside sanction thumb image : offsideballline.svg thumb 300px right the blue forward in the penalty area of the diagram is not in an offside position , as they are behind the ball , despite the fact that they are closer to the opponents ' goal line than the second-last opponent a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) '' there is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick , a corner kick , or a throw-in in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) '' an offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a direct free kick , indirect free kick , or dropped-ball since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence the new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely , but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent the sanction for an offside offence is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred , even if it is in the player 's own half of the field of play the assistant referees ' task with regard to offside can be difficult , as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks , consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played , and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play the risk of false judgement is further increased by the foreshortening effect , which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player , and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender the motivations for offside rules varied at different times , and were not always clearly stated when the rules were changed in contrast , the offside rules force players not to get ahead of the ball , and thus favour dribbling the ball and short passes over few long passes a law similar to offside was used in the game of cornish hurling played in cornwall in the early seventeenth century : ( this is similar to the current offside law in rugby , under which any player between the ball and the opponent 's goal who takes part in play , is liable to be penalised ) such laws included shrewsbury school ( 1855 ) , uppingham school ( 1857 ) , trinity college , hartford ( 1858 ) , winchester college ( 1863 ) , and the cambridge rules 1863 in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line in contrast with the school and university games , surviving rules of independent football clubs from before 1860 tend to lack any offside law in a letter to the field in february 1867 , sheffield fc secretary harry chambers wrote that sheffield fc had adopted a rule at the beginning of the 1863 season requiring one opponent to be level or closer to the opponent 's goal the influence of thring 's views is shown by the adoption of his proposed offside law in the first draft of the fa laws ( see below ) it was also proposed that the fa should revert to its original '' strict '' offside rule in 2009 , it was stated that a defender who leaves the field of play without the referee 's permission must be considered to be on the nearest boundary line for the purposes of deciding whether an attacker is in an offside position in 2016 , it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself can not be in an offside position : part of the player 's head , body or feet must be within the opponent 's half of the field of play just before an attacking player is played a through ball , the last defender or defenders move up field , isolating the attacker into an offside position an attacker , upon realizing they are in an offside position , may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else

offside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent team-mate to touch the ball being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play like fouls , however , any play ( such as the scoring of a goal ) that occurs after an offence has taken place , but before the referee is able to stop the play , is nullified the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage in neither of these cases is the player being penalised for being offside ; they are being cautioned for acts of unsporting behaviour the offside rule limits attackers ' ability to do this , requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward though restricted , well-timed passes and fast running allow an attacker to move into such a situation after the ball is kicked forward without committing the offence one of the main duties of the assistant referees is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside — their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch assistant referees communicate that an offside offence has occurred by raising a signal flag the application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps : offside position , offside offence , and offside sanction thumb image : offsideballline.svg thumb 300px right the blue forward in the penalty area of the diagram is not in an offside position , as they are behind the ball , despite the fact that they are closer to the opponents ' goal line than the second-last opponent a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) any part of the player 's head , body or feet is closer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent the goalkeeper counts as an opponent in the second condition , but it is not necessary that the last opponent be the goalkeeper '' there is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick , a corner kick , or a throw-in in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) '' an offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a direct free kick , indirect free kick , or dropped-ball since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence determining whether a player is '' involved in active play '' can be complex the new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely , but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent this additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law , and forms the last 3 conditions under the heading '' interfering with an opponent '' as shown above the circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save , in the context of a ball that has '' been deliberately saved by any opponent offside laws are found in the largely uncodified and informal football games played at english public schools in the early 19th century an 1832 article discussing the eton wall game complained of '' the interminable multiplicity of rules about sneaking , picking up , throwing , rolling , in straight , with a vast number more '' , using the term '' sneaking '' to refer to eton 's offside law '' such a player was prevented from kicking the ball , touching the ball down , or interfering with an opponent ( this is similar to the current offside law in rugby , under which any player between the ball and the opponent 's goal who takes part in play , is liable to be penalised ) in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line the 1862 laws of barnes fc featured a strict offside law sheffield fc also adopted a weak offside law at the beginning of the 1863–64 season when an attacking team adopted the so-called '' one back '' game , in which only the goalkeeper and one outfield player remained in defensive positions , it was even possible for players to be caught offside in their own penalty area ( according to the '' strict '' offside law used in 1863 , every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick , since it had to be taken from the goal line )

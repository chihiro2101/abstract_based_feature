offside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent team-mate to touch the ball being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play like fouls , however , any play ( such as the scoring of a goal ) that occurs after an offence has taken place , but before the referee is able to stop the play , is nullified the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage the offside rule limits attackers ' ability to do this , requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward officiating decisions regarding offside , which can often be a matter of only centimetres or inches , can be critical in games , as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue , or even if a goal is allowed to stand however , as with all officiating decisions in the game , adjudicating offside is ultimately up to the referee , who can overrule the advice of their assistants if they see fit the application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps : offside position , offside offence , and offside sanction thumb image : offsideballline.svg thumb 300px right the blue forward in the penalty area of the diagram is not in an offside position , as they are behind the ball , despite the fact that they are closer to the opponents ' goal line than the second-last opponent a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent any part of the player 's head , body or feet is closer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' there is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick , a corner kick , or a throw-in in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence in an effort to avoid such criticisms , which were based on the fact that phrases such as '' interfering with play '' , '' interfering with an opponent '' , and '' gaining an advantage '' were not clearly defined , fifa issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003 ; and these were incorporated into law 11 in july 2005 the circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save , in the context of a ball that has '' been deliberately saved by any opponent the sanction for an offside offence is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred , even if it is in the player 's own half of the field of play in enforcing this rule , the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee , who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent , the ball , or the halfway line , whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end the assistant referees ' task with regard to offside can be difficult , as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks , consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played , and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play in contrast , the offside rules force players not to get ahead of the ball , and thus favour dribbling the ball and short passes over few long passes '' such a player was prevented from kicking the ball , touching the ball down , or interfering with an opponent any player ahead of the ball was in an off-side position in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line in the sheffield game , players known as '' kick-throughs '' were positioned permanently near the opponents ' goal he criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax : the rugby laws , for example , were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball , while eton 's rule of four allowed '' an immense amount of sneaking '' when the number of players was unlimited thring expressed his views through correspondence in the sporting newspapers such as the field , and through the publication in 1862 of a proposed set of laws known as the simplest game , including a strict offside law which required a player in an offside position ( '' out of play '' , in thring 's terminology ) to '' return behind the ball as soon as possible '' however , the two codes were eventually unified without any change in this area ; the sheffield clubs accepted the fa 's three-player offside rule in 1877 , after the fa compromised by allowing the throw-in to be taken in any direction in 1990 , ifab altered the offside law so that an attacker who is level with the second-last defender would be considered onside , whereas previously such a player would have been considered offside in 2016 , it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself can not be in an offside position : part of the player 's head , body or feet must be within the opponent 's half of the field of play since the first fa laws of 1863 , a player has not been penalized for being in an offside position at the moment a team-mate takes a goal kick the next year ( 1878 ) a new law was introduced to allow a player to be offside from a throw-in now that changes to the interpretations of '' interfering with play , interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage '' mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play , players not involved in active play can not be '' caught offside '' , making the tactic riskier

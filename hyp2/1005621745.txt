offside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent team-mate to touch the ball being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play like fouls , however , any play ( such as the scoring of a goal ) that occurs after an offence has taken place , but before the referee is able to stop the play , is nullified the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage an attacker who is able to receive the ball behind the opposition defenders is often in a good position to score though restricted , well-timed passes and fast running allow an attacker to move into such a situation after the ball is kicked forward without committing the offence officiating decisions regarding offside , which can often be a matter of only centimetres or inches , can be critical in games , as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue , or even if a goal is allowed to stand the application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps : offside position , offside offence , and offside sanction a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) any part of the player 's head , body or feet is closer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent the goalkeeper counts as an opponent in the second condition , but it is not necessary that the last opponent be the goalkeeper in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) '' an offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a direct free kick , indirect free kick , or dropped-ball since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence the circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save , in the context of a ball that has '' been deliberately saved by any opponent the sanction for an offside offence is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred , even if it is in the player 's own half of the field of play in enforcing this rule , the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee , who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent , the ball , or the halfway line , whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end the assistant referees ' task with regard to offside can be difficult , as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks , consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played , and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play the risk of false judgement is further increased by the foreshortening effect , which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player , and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy : if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions , they can be two metres apart in less than a second it has been argued that human beings and technological media are incapable of accurately detecting an offside position quickly enough to make a timely decision a law similar to offside was used in the game of cornish hurling played in cornwall in the early seventeenth century : '' such a player was prevented from kicking the ball , touching the ball down , or interfering with an opponent in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line in a letter to the field in february 1867 , sheffield fc secretary harry chambers wrote that sheffield fc had adopted a rule at the beginning of the 1863 season requiring one opponent to be level or closer to the opponent 's goal there were attempts to introduce the one-player rule of the sheffield football association in 1867 ( sheffield fc ) , 1872 ( sheffield football association ) , 1873 ( nottingham forest ) , and 1874 ( sheffield association ) the original laws allowed players to be in an offside position even when in their own half in 2005 , ifab clarified that , when evaluating an attacking player 's position for the purposes of the offside law , the part of the player 's head , body or feet closest to the defending team 's goal-line should be considered , with the hands and arms being excluded because '' there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent '' ( according to the '' strict '' offside law used in 1863 , every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick , since it had to be taken from the goal line ) in 1987 , the football association ( fa ) obtained the permission of ifab to test such a rule in the 1987–88 football conference just before an attacking player is played a through ball , the last defender or defenders move up field , isolating the attacker into an offside position

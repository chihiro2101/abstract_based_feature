offside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent team-mate to touch the ball being in an offside position is not an offence in itself a player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a team-mate must then become involved in active play , in the opinion of the referee , in order for an offence to occur when the offside offence occurs , the referee stops play , and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play like fouls , however , any play ( such as the scoring of a goal ) that occurs after an offence has taken place , but before the referee is able to stop the play , is nullified the only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player 's offside position , or if a forward , having left the field , returns and gains an advantage the offside rule limits attackers ' ability to do this , requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward one of the main duties of the assistant referees is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside — their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch the application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps : offside position , offside offence , and offside sanction thumb image : offsideballline.svg thumb 300px right the blue forward in the penalty area of the diagram is not in an offside position , as they are behind the ball , despite the fact that they are closer to the opponents ' goal line than the second-last opponent a player is in an '' offside position '' if they are in the opposing team 's half of the field and also '' nearer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent '' the 2005 edition of the laws of the game included a new ifab decision that stated , '' in the definition of offside position , 'nearer to his opponents ' goal line ' means that any part of their head , body or feet is nearer to their opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent '' in other words , a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met : any part of the player 's head , body or feet is in the opponents ' half of the field ( excluding the half-way line ) any part of the player 's head , body or feet is closer to the opponents ' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent it is also not an offence if the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent ( except for a deliberate save ) in this context , according to the ifab , '' a ‘ save ’ is when a player stops , or attempts to stop , a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms ( unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area ) since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a team-mate , not when the player receives the ball , it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent , or even the last opponent , without committing an offence in an effort to avoid such criticisms , which were based on the fact that phrases such as '' interfering with play '' , '' interfering with an opponent '' , and '' gaining an advantage '' were not clearly defined , fifa issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003 ; and these were incorporated into law 11 in july 2005 the new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely , but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent in enforcing this rule , the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee , who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent , the ball , or the halfway line , whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end the assistant referees ' task with regard to offside can be difficult , as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks , consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played , and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play in general , offside rules intend to prevent players from “ goal-hanging ” – staying near the opponent 's goal and waiting for the ball to be passed to then directly score a goal a law similar to offside was used in the game of cornish hurling played in cornwall in the early seventeenth century : offside laws are found in the largely uncodified and informal football games played at english public schools in the early 19th century an 1832 article discussing the eton wall game complained of '' the interminable multiplicity of rules about sneaking , picking up , throwing , rolling , in straight , with a vast number more '' , using the term '' sneaking '' to refer to eton 's offside law ( this is similar to the current offside law in rugby , under which any player between the ball and the opponent 's goal who takes part in play , is liable to be penalised ) such laws included shrewsbury school ( 1855 ) , uppingham school ( 1857 ) , trinity college , hartford ( 1858 ) , winchester college ( 1863 ) , and the cambridge rules 1863 in the 1847 laws of the eton field game , as player could not be considered '' sneaking '' if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents ' goal line this is true of the brief handwritten set of laws for the foot-ball club of edinburgh ( 1833 ) , the published laws of surrey football club ( 1849 ) , the first set of laws of sheffield football club ( 1858 ) and those of melbourne football club ( 1859 ) in a letter to the field in february 1867 , sheffield fc secretary harry chambers wrote that sheffield fc had adopted a rule at the beginning of the 1863 season requiring one opponent to be level or closer to the opponent 's goal he criticized most existing offside laws for being too lax : the rugby laws , for example , were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball , while eton 's rule of four allowed '' an immense amount of sneaking '' when the number of players was unlimited at the first revision of the fa laws , in february 1866 , an important qualifier was added to soften the '' strict '' offside law : at the fa 's meeting , the alteration '' gave rise to a lengthy discussion , many thinking with mr in 2005 , ifab clarified that , when evaluating an attacking player 's position for the purposes of the offside law , the part of the player 's head , body or feet closest to the defending team 's goal-line should be considered , with the hands and arms being excluded because '' there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent '' since the first fa laws of 1863 , a player has not been penalized for being in an offside position at the moment a team-mate takes a goal kick now that changes to the interpretations of '' interfering with play , interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage '' mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play , players not involved in active play can not be '' caught offside '' , making the tactic riskier

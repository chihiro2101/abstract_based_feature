the genus was first described in the scientific literature by johann heinrich friedrich link in his 1809 work observationes in ordines plantarum naturales ; he wrote , '' penicillium thallus e floccis caespitosis septatis simplicibus aut ramosis fertilibus erectis apice penicillatis '' , where penicillatis referred to '' pencil-like '' ( referring to a camel 's hair pencil brush identification and nomenclature of the genus penicillium , c.m pitt divided penicillium into four subgenera based on conidiophore morphology and branching pattern : aspergilloides , biverticillium , furcatum , and penicillium selected species include ; penicillium albocoremium penicillium aurantiogriseum , a grain contaminant penicillium bilaiae , which is an agricultural inoculant penicillium camemberti , which is used in the production of camembert and brie cheeses penicillium candidum , which is used in making brie and camembert the genus name is derived from the latin root penicillum , meaning '' painter 's brush '' , and refers to the chains of conidia that resemble a broom species of penicillium are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium many species produce highly toxic mycotoxins the ability of these penicillium species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist some species have a blue color , commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture some penicillium species affect the fruits and bulbs of plants , including p penicillium growth can still occur indoors even if the relative humidity is low , as long as there is sufficient moisture available on a given surface penicillium camemberti and penicillium roqueforti are the molds on camembert , brie , roquefort , and many other cheeses the drug 's success in saving soldiers in world war ii who had been dying from infected wounds resulted in fleming , florey and chain jointly winning the nobel prize in medicine in 1945 additional species that produce compounds capable of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in vitro include : p prior to 2013 , when the '' one fungus , one name '' nomenclature change came into effect , penicillium was used as the genus for anamorph ( clonal forms ) of fungi and talaromyces was used for the teleomorph ( sexual forms ) of fungi

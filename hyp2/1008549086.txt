the genus was first described in the scientific literature by johann heinrich friedrich link in his 1809 work observationes in ordines plantarum naturales ; he wrote , '' penicillium identification and nomenclature of the genus penicillium , c.m & nbsp ; glaucum—all of which produced a brush-like conidiophore ( asexual spore-producing structure ) & nbsp ; expansum was later selected as the type species pitt divided penicillium into four subgenera based on conidiophore morphology and branching pattern : aspergilloides , biverticillium , furcatum , and penicillium species included in subgenus biverticillium were later merged into talaromyces sexual reproduction involves the production of ascospores , commencing with the fusion of an archegonium and an antheridium , with sharing of nuclei species of penicillium are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available saprophytic species of penicillium and aspergillus are among the best-known representatives of the eurotiales and live mainly on organic biodegradable substances commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium the fungus can be readily transported from the outdoors , and grow indoors using building material or accumulated soil to obtain nutrients for growth penicillium growth can still occur indoors even if the relative humidity is low , as long as there is sufficient moisture available on a given surface even ceiling tiles can support the growth of penicillium—as one study demonstrated—if the relative humidity is 85 % and the moisture content of the tiles is greater than 2.2 % penicillium camemberti and penicillium roqueforti are the molds on camembert , brie , roquefort , and many other cheeses some penicillium species have shown potential for use in bioremediation , more specifically mycoremediation , because of their ability to break down a variety of xenobiotic compounds for example , sexual capability was recently shown for the fungus penicillium roqueforti , used as a starter for blue cheese production after 2013 however , fungi were reclassified based on their genetic relatedness to each other and now both penicillium and talaromyces genera both contain species capable of clonal only and sexual reproduction

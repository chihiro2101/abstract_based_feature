the genus was first described in the scientific literature by johann heinrich friedrich link in his 1809 work observationes in ordines plantarum naturales ; he wrote , '' penicillium identification and nomenclature of the genus penicillium , c.m samson , 22 september 2014 , name link1809/ > link included three species—p selected species include ; penicillium albocoremium penicillium aurantiogriseum , a grain contaminant penicillium bilaiae , which is an agricultural inoculant penicillium camemberti , which is used in the production of camembert and brie cheeses penicillium candidum , which is used in making brie and camembert these propagules play a significant role in reproduction ; conidia are the main dispersal strategy of these fungi species of penicillium are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available saprophytic species of penicillium and aspergillus are among the best-known representatives of the eurotiales and live mainly on organic biodegradable substances commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium the ability of these penicillium species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist some species have a blue color , commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture some penicillium species affect the fruits and bulbs of plants , including p even ceiling tiles can support the growth of penicillium—as one study demonstrated—if the relative humidity is 85 % and the moisture content of the tiles is greater than 2.2 % some penicillium species have shown potential for use in bioremediation , more specifically mycoremediation , because of their ability to break down a variety of xenobiotic compounds & nbsp ; notatum ) , was accidentally discovered by alexander fleming in 1929 , and found to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria ( see beta-lactams ) however recent studies have revealed that sex occurs even in some of the supposedly asexual species these findings with penicillium species are consistent with accumulating evidence from studies of other eukaryote species that sex was likely present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes after 2013 however , fungi were reclassified based on their genetic relatedness to each other and now both penicillium and talaromyces genera both contain species capable of clonal only and sexual reproduction

the genus was first described in the scientific literature by johann heinrich friedrich link in his 1809 work observationes in ordines plantarum naturales ; he wrote , '' penicillium thallus e floccis caespitosis septatis simplicibus aut ramosis fertilibus erectis apice penicillatis '' , where penicillatis referred to '' pencil-like '' ( referring to a camel 's hair pencil brush & nbsp ; expansum was later selected as the type species pitt divided penicillium into four subgenera based on conidiophore morphology and branching pattern : aspergilloides , biverticillium , furcatum , and penicillium species included in subgenus biverticillium were later merged into talaromyces selected species include ; penicillium albocoremium penicillium aurantiogriseum , a grain contaminant penicillium bilaiae , which is an agricultural inoculant penicillium camemberti , which is used in the production of camembert and brie cheeses penicillium candidum , which is used in making brie and camembert conidiophores are at the end of each branch accompanied by green spherical constricted units called conidia the irregularly distributed asci contain eight unicellular ascospores each species of penicillium are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available saprophytic species of penicillium and aspergillus are among the best-known representatives of the eurotiales and live mainly on organic biodegradable substances commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium the ability of these penicillium species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist penicillium growth can still occur indoors even if the relative humidity is low , as long as there is sufficient moisture available on a given surface penicillium camemberti and penicillium roqueforti are the molds on camembert , brie , roquefort , and many other cheeses penicillium nalgiovense is used in soft mold-ripened cheeses , such as nal≈æovy ( ellischau ) cheese , and to improve the taste of sausages and hams , and to prevent colonization by other molds and bacteria penicillium chrysogenum is of major medical and historical importance as the original and present-day industrial source of the antibiotic penicillin after 2013 however , fungi were reclassified based on their genetic relatedness to each other and now both penicillium and talaromyces genera both contain species capable of clonal only and sexual reproduction

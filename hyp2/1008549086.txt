the genus was first described in the scientific literature by johann heinrich friedrich link in his 1809 work observationes in ordines plantarum naturales ; he wrote , '' penicillium identification and nomenclature of the genus penicillium , c.m samson , 22 september 2014 , name link1809/ > link included three speciesâ€”p pitt divided penicillium into four subgenera based on conidiophore morphology and branching pattern : aspergilloides , biverticillium , furcatum , and penicillium the genus name is derived from the latin root penicillum , meaning '' painter 's brush '' , and refers to the chains of conidia that resemble a broom conidiophores are at the end of each branch accompanied by green spherical constricted units called conidia these propagules play a significant role in reproduction ; conidia are the main dispersal strategy of these fungi species of penicillium are ubiquitous soil fungi preferring cool and moderate climates , commonly present wherever organic material is available saprophytic species of penicillium and aspergillus are among the best-known representatives of the eurotiales and live mainly on organic biodegradable substances commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium the ability of these penicillium species to grow on seeds and other stored foods depends on their propensity to thrive in low humidity and to colonize rapidly by aerial dispersion while the seeds are sufficiently moist some species have a blue color , commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture several species of the genus penicillium play a central role in the production of cheese and of various meat products the genus includes a wide variety of species molds that are the source molds of major antibiotics for example , sexual capability was recently shown for the fungus penicillium roqueforti , used as a starter for blue cheese production penicillium chrysogenum is of major medical and historical importance as the original and present-day industrial source of the antibiotic penicillin prior to 2013 , when the '' one fungus , one name '' nomenclature change came into effect , penicillium was used as the genus for anamorph ( clonal forms ) of fungi and talaromyces was used for the teleomorph ( sexual forms ) of fungi

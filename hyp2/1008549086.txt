the genus was first described in the scientific literature by johann heinrich friedrich link in his 1809 work observationes in ordines plantarum naturales ; he wrote , '' penicillium identification and nomenclature of the genus penicillium , c.m samson , 22 september 2014 , name link1809/ > link included three species—p & nbsp ; glaucum—all of which produced a brush-like conidiophore ( asexual spore-producing structure ) & nbsp ; expansum was later selected as the type species these propagules play a significant role in reproduction ; conidia are the main dispersal strategy of these fungi sexual reproduction involves the production of ascospores , commencing with the fusion of an archegonium and an antheridium , with sharing of nuclei commonly known in america as molds , they are among the main causes of food spoilage , especially species of subgenus penicillium many species produce highly toxic mycotoxins some species have a blue color , commonly growing on old bread and giving it a blue fuzzy texture some penicillium species affect the fruits and bulbs of plants , including p & nbsp ; waksmanii are potential pathogens of mosquitoes even ceiling tiles can support the growth of penicillium—as one study demonstrated—if the relative humidity is 85 % and the moisture content of the tiles is greater than 2.2 % the genus includes a wide variety of species molds that are the source molds of major antibiotics & nbsp ; notatum ) , was accidentally discovered by alexander fleming in 1929 , and found to inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria ( see beta-lactams ) for example , sexual capability was recently shown for the fungus penicillium roqueforti , used as a starter for blue cheese production these findings with penicillium species are consistent with accumulating evidence from studies of other eukaryote species that sex was likely present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes

early jet aircraft such as the 707 and dc-8 seated passengers along either side of a single aisle , with no more than six seats per row larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats engineers realized having two decks created difficulties in meeting emergency evacuation regulations with the technology available at that time by adding a second aisle , the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across , but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast the engineers also opted for creating '' stretched '' versions of the dc-8 ( 61 , 62 and 63 models ) , as well as longer versions of boeing 's 707 ( -320b and 320c models ) and 727 ( -200 model ) ; and douglas ' dc-9 ( -30 , -40 , and -50 models ) , all of which were capable of accommodating more seats than their shorter predecessor versions the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 new trijet wide-body aircraft soon followed , including the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and the lockheed l-1011 tristar both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet the proposed comac c929 and c939 may also share this new wide-body market greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage as jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades , most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines , although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines : the airbus a380 , boeing 747-8 the interiors of aircraft , known as the aircraft cabin , have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft airbus a340 , airbus a380 , and boeing 747 four-engine wide-body aircraft are used to test new generations of aircraft engines in flight two shuttle carrier aircraft were used to transport the u.s aircraft seat map competition between airbus and boeing large aircraft list of large aircraft narrow-body aircraft

following the success of the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 in the late 1950s and early 1960s , airlines began seeking larger aircraft to meet the rising global demand for air travel engineers were faced with many challenges as airlines demanded more passenger seats per aircraft , longer ranges and lower operating costs early jet aircraft such as the 707 and dc-8 seated passengers along either side of a single aisle , with no more than six seats per row larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats thus , it was believed that most subsonic aircraft would become obsolete for passenger travel and would be eventually converted to freighters the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 new trijet wide-body aircraft soon followed , including the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and the lockheed l-1011 tristar in the '' jumbo '' category , the capacity of the boeing 747 was not surpassed until october 2007 , when the airbus a380 entered commercial service with the nickname '' superjumbo '' both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet twin aisles that accelerate loading , unloading , and evacuation compared to a single aisle ( wide-body airliners typically have 3.5 to 5 seats abreast per aisle , compared to 5â€“6 on most narrow-body aircraft ) reduced overall aircraft length for a given capacity , improving ground manoeuvrability and reducing the risk of tailstrike greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage as jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades , most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines , although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines : the airbus a380 , boeing 747-8 bar and lounge areas which were once installed on wide-body aircraft have mostly disappeared , but a few have returned in first class or business class on the airbus a340-600 , 777-300er , and on the airbus a380 airbus a340 , airbus a380 , and boeing 747 four-engine wide-body aircraft are used to test new generations of aircraft engines in flight aircraft seat map competition between airbus and boeing large aircraft list of large aircraft narrow-body aircraft

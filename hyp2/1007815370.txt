following the success of the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 in the late 1950s and early 1960s , airlines began seeking larger aircraft to meet the rising global demand for air travel engineers were faced with many challenges as airlines demanded more passenger seats per aircraft , longer ranges and lower operating costs early jet aircraft such as the 707 and dc-8 seated passengers along either side of a single aisle , with no more than six seats per row larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats thus , it was believed that most subsonic aircraft would become obsolete for passenger travel and would be eventually converted to freighters by adding a second aisle , the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across , but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 new trijet wide-body aircraft soon followed , including the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and the lockheed l-1011 tristar however , in 1976 the soviet union launched its own first four-engined wide-body , the ilyushin il-86 after the success of the early wide-body aircraft , several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades , including the boeing 767 and 777 , the airbus a330 and a340 , and the mcdonnell douglas md-11 both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines , although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines : the airbus a380 , boeing 747-8 the upcoming boeing 777x-9 twinjet is approaching the capacity of the earlier boeing 747 the interiors of aircraft , known as the aircraft cabin , have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft in some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft , such as the boeing 777 , the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage wide-body aircraft are used in science , research , and the military

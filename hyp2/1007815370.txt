following the success of the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 in the late 1950s and early 1960s , airlines began seeking larger aircraft to meet the rising global demand for air travel larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats as a result , airline manufacturers opted for a wider fuselage rather than a taller one ( the 747 , and eventually the dc-10 and l-1011 ) the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 new trijet wide-body aircraft soon followed , including the mcdonnell douglas dc-10 and the lockheed l-1011 tristar after the success of the early wide-body aircraft , several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades , including the boeing 767 and 777 , the airbus a330 and a340 , and the mcdonnell douglas md-11 both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet the production of the large boeing 747-8 and airbus a380 four-engine , long-haul jets is being cut back as airlines are now preferring the smaller , more efficient a350 , 787 and 777 twin-engine , long-range airliners the only exception to this would be with very long narrow-body aircraft , such as the boeing 757 and airbus a321 greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage as jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades , most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines , although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines : the airbus a380 , boeing 747-8 bar and lounge areas which were once installed on wide-body aircraft have mostly disappeared , but a few have returned in first class or business class on the airbus a340-600 , 777-300er , and on the airbus a380 some wide-body aircraft are used as flying command posts by the military like the ilyushin il-80 or the boeing e-4 , while the boeing e-767 is used for airborne early warning and control airbus a340 , airbus a380 , and boeing 747 four-engine wide-body aircraft are used to test new generations of aircraft engines in flight aircraft seat map competition between airbus and boeing large aircraft list of large aircraft narrow-body aircraft

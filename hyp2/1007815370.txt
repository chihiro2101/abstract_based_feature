following the success of the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 in the late 1950s and early 1960s , airlines began seeking larger aircraft to meet the rising global demand for air travel engineers were faced with many challenges as airlines demanded more passenger seats per aircraft , longer ranges and lower operating costs larger aircraft would have to be longer , higher ( such as a double-deck ) , or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats by adding a second aisle , the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across , but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast the engineers also opted for creating '' stretched '' versions of the dc-8 ( 61 , 62 and 63 models ) , as well as longer versions of boeing 's 707 ( -320b and 320c models ) and 727 ( -200 model ) ; and douglas ' dc-9 ( -30 , -40 , and -50 models ) , all of which were capable of accommodating more seats than their shorter predecessor versions the wide-body age began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner , the four-engined , partial double-deck boeing 747 after the success of the early wide-body aircraft , several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades , including the boeing 767 and 777 , the airbus a330 and a340 , and the mcdonnell douglas md-11 in the '' jumbo '' category , the capacity of the boeing 747 was not surpassed until october 2007 , when the airbus a380 entered commercial service with the nickname '' superjumbo '' both the boeing 747 and airbus a380 '' jumbo jets '' have four engines each ( quad-jets ) , but the upcoming boeing 777x ( '' mini jumbo jet '' ) is a twinjet the proposed comac c929 and c939 may also share this new wide-body market greater under-floor freight capacity better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design british and russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the vickers vc10 and douglas dc-9 , but with a wide-body fuselage as jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades , most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines , although the heaviest wide-body aircraft are built with four engines : the airbus a380 , boeing 747-8 the interiors of aircraft , known as the aircraft cabin , have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft airbus a340 , airbus a380 , and boeing 747 four-engine wide-body aircraft are used to test new generations of aircraft engines in flight aircraft seat map competition between airbus and boeing large aircraft list of large aircraft narrow-body aircraft

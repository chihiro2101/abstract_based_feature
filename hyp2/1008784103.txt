photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene subsurface scattering can accurately be modeled using photon mapping with photon mapping , light packets called photons are sent out into the scene from the light sources whenever a photon intersects with a surface , the intersection point and incoming direction are stored in a cache called the photon map typically , two photon maps are created for a scene : one especially for caustics and a global one for other light at this point , the rendering equation is used to calculate the surface radiance leaving the point of intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it the contribution to the surface radiance from caustics is calculated using the caustics photon map directly for each photon , divide the amount of flux ( real photons ) that the photon represents by the area of s and multiply by the brdf applied to that photon during the photon mapping process , when a photon strikes a surface , in addition to the usual operations performed , a shadow photon is emitted in the same direction the original photon came from that goes all the way through the object global illumination using photon maps realistic image synthesis using photon mapping photon mapping introduction from worcester polytechnic institute bias in rendering siggraph paper

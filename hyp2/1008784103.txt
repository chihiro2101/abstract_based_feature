light refracted or reflected causes patterns called caustics , usually visible as concentrated patches of light on nearby surfaces for example , as light rays pass through a wine glass sitting on a table , they are refracted and patterns of light are visible on the table photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene subsurface scattering can accurately be modeled using photon mapping with photon mapping , light packets called photons are sent out into the scene from the light sources typically , two photon maps are created for a scene : one especially for caustics and a global one for other light if the photon is absorbed , no new direction is given , and tracing for that photon ends for an accurate estimate of direct illumination , a ray is traced from the point of intersection to each light source although photon mapping was designed to work primarily with ray tracers , it can also be extended for use with scanline rendering global illumination using photon maps realistic image synthesis using photon mapping photon mapping introduction from worcester polytechnic institute bias in rendering siggraph paper

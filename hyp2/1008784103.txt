for example , as light rays pass through a wine glass sitting on a table , they are refracted and patterns of light are visible on the table photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene with photon mapping , light packets called photons are sent out into the scene from the light sources whenever a photon intersects with a surface , the intersection point and incoming direction are stored in a cache called the photon map if the photon is absorbed , no new direction is given , and tracing for that photon ends at this point , the rendering equation is used to calculate the surface radiance leaving the point of intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it for an accurate estimate of direct illumination , a ray is traced from the point of intersection to each light source for soft indirect illumination , radiance is calculated using the photon map directly then during the direct illumination calculation , instead of sending out a ray from the surface to the light that tests collisions with objects , the photon map is queried for shadow photons global illumination using photon maps realistic image synthesis using photon mapping photon mapping introduction from worcester polytechnic institute bias in rendering siggraph paper

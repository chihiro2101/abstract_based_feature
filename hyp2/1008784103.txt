light refracted or reflected causes patterns called caustics , usually visible as concentrated patches of light on nearby surfaces photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear photon mapping is particularly adept at handling this effect because the algorithm reflects photons from one surface to another based on that surface 's bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) , and thus light from one object striking another is a natural result of the method photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene with photon mapping , light packets called photons are sent out into the scene from the light sources whenever a photon intersects with a surface , the intersection point and incoming direction are stored in a cache called the photon map at this point , the rendering equation is used to calculate the surface radiance leaving the point of intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it the sum of those results for each photon represents total surface radiance returned by the surface intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it during the photon mapping process , when a photon strikes a surface , in addition to the usual operations performed , a shadow photon is emitted in the same direction the original photon came from that goes all the way through the object although photon mapping was designed to work primarily with ray tracers , it can also be extended for use with scanline rendering global illumination using photon maps realistic image synthesis using photon mapping photon mapping introduction from worcester polytechnic institute bias in rendering siggraph paper

light refracted or reflected causes patterns called caustics , usually visible as concentrated patches of light on nearby surfaces for example , as light rays pass through a wine glass sitting on a table , they are refracted and patterns of light are visible on the table photon mapping can trace the paths of individual photons to model where these concentrated patches of light will appear photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from the nature of the geometry in the scene subsurface scattering can accurately be modeled using photon mapping with photon mapping , light packets called photons are sent out into the scene from the light sources in this step of the algorithm , the photon map created in the first pass is used to estimate the radiance of every pixel of the output image at this point , the rendering equation is used to calculate the surface radiance leaving the point of intersection in the direction of the ray that struck it for an approximate estimate of indirect illumination , the photon map is used to calculate the radiance contribution the next object it collides with causes a shadow photon to be stored in the photon map then during the direct illumination calculation , instead of sending out a ray from the surface to the light that tests collisions with objects , the photon map is queried for shadow photons

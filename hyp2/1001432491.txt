micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the solar system sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the earth 's atmosphere fraundorf ( 1980 ) the distribution of temperature maxima for micrometeorites decelerated in the earth 's atmosphere without melting geophys since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected interplanetary dust ( called brownlee particles before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed ) have become an important component of the extraterrestrial materials available for study in laboratories on earth in 1946 during the giacobinids , helmut landsberg collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower fred whipple , '' the theory of micro-meteorites , part i : in an isothermal atmosphere '' , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , volume 36 number 12 ( 15 december 1950 ) , pp fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the solar system , consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material , like comets in 1957 , hans pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the earth , estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations andrew snelling and david rush , '' moon dust and the age of the solar system '' creation ex-nihilo technical journal , volume 7 number 1 ( 1993 ) , p resistance to micrometeoroid impact is a significant design challenge for spacecraft and space suit designers ( see thermal micrometeoroid garment ) his studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote fred whipple , '' of comets and meteors '' science , volume 289 number 5480 ( 4 august 2000 ) , p

micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the solar system tiny particles are a major contributor to space weathering processes micrometeoroids have less stable orbits than meteoroids , due to their greater surface area to mass ratio meteorites and micrometeorites ( as they are known upon arrival at the earth 's surface ) can only be collected in areas where there is no terrestrial sedimentation , typically polar regions sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the earth 's atmosphere fraundorf ( 1980 ) the distribution of temperature maxima for micrometeorites decelerated in the earth 's atmosphere without melting geophys since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected interplanetary dust ( called brownlee particles before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed ) have become an important component of the extraterrestrial materials available for study in laboratories on earth fred whipple , '' the theory of micro-meteorites , part i : in an isothermal atmosphere '' , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , volume 36 number 12 ( 15 december 1950 ) , pp fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations andrew snelling and david rush , '' moon dust and the age of the solar system '' creation ex-nihilo technical journal , volume 7 number 1 ( 1993 ) , p resistance to micrometeoroid impact is a significant design challenge for spacecraft and space suit designers ( see thermal micrometeoroid garment ) impacts by small objects with extremely high velocity ( 10 kilometers per second ) are a current area of research in terminal ballistics fred whipple , '' of comets and meteors '' science , volume 289 number 5480 ( 4 august 2000 ) , p

micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the solar system tiny particles are a major contributor to space weathering processes when they hit the surface of the moon , or any airless body ( mercury , the asteroids , etc micrometeoroids have less stable orbits than meteoroids , due to their greater surface area to mass ratio micrometeoroids that fall to earth can provide information on millimeter scale heating events in the solar nebula sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the earth 's atmosphere fraundorf ( 1980 ) the distribution of temperature maxima for micrometeorites decelerated in the earth 's atmosphere without melting geophys in order to classify these sorts of objects , he coined the term '' micrometeorite '' this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations these showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere , or flux , was in line with the optical measurements , at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year micrometeoroids pose a significant threat to space exploration resistance to micrometeoroid impact is a significant design challenge for spacecraft and space suit designers ( see thermal micrometeoroid garment ) his studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote when a micrometeoroid strikes the foil , it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads

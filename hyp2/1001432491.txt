micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the solar system tiny particles are a major contributor to space weathering processes micrometeoroids that fall to earth can provide information on millimeter scale heating events in the solar nebula sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into the earth 's atmosphere fraundorf ( 1980 ) the distribution of temperature maxima for micrometeorites decelerated in the earth 's atmosphere without melting geophys fred whipple , '' the theory of micro-meteorites , part i : in an isothermal atmosphere '' , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , volume 36 number 12 ( 15 december 1950 ) , pp fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the solar system , consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material , like comets in 1957 , hans pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the earth , estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations these showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere , or flux , was in line with the optical measurements , at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year resistance to micrometeoroid impact is a significant design challenge for spacecraft and space suit designers ( see thermal micrometeoroid garment ) whipple 's work pre-dated the space race and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later when a micrometeoroid strikes the foil , it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads

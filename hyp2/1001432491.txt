meteorites and micrometeorites ( as they are known upon arrival at the earth 's surface ) can only be collected in areas where there is no terrestrial sedimentation , typically polar regions olszewski ( 1977 ) interplanetary dust : a new source of extraterrestrial material for laboratory studies , proc since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected interplanetary dust ( called brownlee particles before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed ) have become an important component of the extraterrestrial materials available for study in laboratories on earth fred whipple , '' the theory of micro-meteorites , part i : in an isothermal atmosphere '' , proceedings of the national academy of sciences , volume 36 number 12 ( 15 december 1950 ) , pp fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere in 1957 , hans pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the earth , estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations to determine whether the direct measurement was accurate , a number of additional studies followed , including the pegasus satellite program , lunar orbiter 1 , luna 3 , mars 1 and pioneer 5 andrew snelling and david rush , '' moon dust and the age of the solar system '' creation ex-nihilo technical journal , volume 7 number 1 ( 1993 ) , p these showed that the flux was much lower than earlier estimates , around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year impacts by small objects with extremely high velocity ( 10 kilometers per second ) are a current area of research in terminal ballistics by the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft , it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below for spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit , some variety of the whipple shield has been almost universal for decades fred whipple , '' of comets and meteors '' science , volume 289 number 5480 ( 4 august 2000 ) , p

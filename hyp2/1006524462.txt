in 1922 , after several risqué films and a series of off-screen scandals involving hollywood stars , the studios enlisted presbyterian elder will h hays to rehabilitate hollywood 's image many felt the movie industry had always been morally questionable ( 2001 ) , '' will hays '' entry political pressure was increasing , with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred movie censorship bills in 1921 hays was paid the then-lavish sum of 100,000 a year ( equal to today ) harding and former head of the republican national committee , siegel & siegel ( 2004 ) , p the supreme court had already decided unanimously in 1915 in mutual film corporation v industrial commission of ohio that free speech did not extend to motion pictures , jowett ( 1989 ) , p and while there had been token attempts to clean up the movies before—such as when the studios formed the national association of the motion picture industry ( nampi ) in 1916—little had come of the efforts new york became the first state to take advantage of the supreme court 's decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921 virginia followed suit the following year , butters jr early in the sound system conversion process , it became apparent that what was acceptable in new york might not be so in kansas self-censorship was deemed a preferable outcome in 1927 , hays suggested to studio executives that they form a committee to discuss film censorship irving thalberg of metro goldwyn mayer , sol wurtzel of fox , and e allen of paramount responded by collaborating on a list they called the '' don'ts and be carefuls '' , which was based on items that were challenged by local censor boards the list was approved by the federal trade commission ( ftc ) , and hays created the studio relations committee ( src ) to oversee its implementation ; vieira ( 1999 ) , p the controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929 in a resolution passed on june 29 , 1927 , the motion picture producers and distributors of america codified a lists of '' don'ts '' and '' be carefuls '' into what they colloquially called their '' magna carta '' 301–302 specifically , the mppda resolved , '' that those things which are included in the following list shall not appear in pictures produced by the members of this association , irrespective of the manner in which they are treated '' : lord created a code of standards smith ( 2005 ) , p one of the main motivating factors in adopting the code was to avoid direct government intervention on march 31 , the mppda agreed it would abide by the code the production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience , making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences the second part was a set of '' particular applications '' , which was an exacting list of items that could not be depicted some restrictions , such as the ban on homosexuality or on the use of specific curse words , were never directly mentioned , but were assumed to be understood without clear demarcation the production code of the motion picture producers and distributors of america , inc if children were supervised and the events implied elliptically , the code allowed '' the possibility of a cinematically inspired thought crime '' authority figures had to be treated with respect , and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains under some circumstances , politicians , police officers , and judges could be villains , as long as it was clear that those individuals portrayed as villains were the exceptions to the rule a recurring theme was '' that throughout , the audience feels sure that evil is wrong , and good is right '' however , the men obliged to enforce the code—jason joy ( head of the committee until 1932 ) and his successor , dr the first film the office reviewed , the blue angel , which was passed by joy with no revisions , was considered indecent by a california censor he was more willing to work with the studios , and his creative writing skills led to his hiring at fox on the other hand , wingate struggled to keep up with the flood of scripts coming in , to the point where warner bros complicating matters , the appeals process ultimately put the responsibility for making the final decision in the hands of the studios when the code was announced , the liberal periodical the nation attacked it the publication stated that if crime were never to be presented in a sympathetic light , then taken literally that would mean that '' law '' and '' justice '' would become one and the same therefore , events such as the boston tea party could not be portrayed if clergy must always be presented in a positive way , then hypocrisy could not be dealt with either the outlook agreed , and , unlike variety , the outlook predicted from the beginning that the code would be difficult to enforce soon , the flouting of the code became an open secret in 1931 , the hollywood reporter mocked the code and quoted an anonymous screenwriter saying that '' the hays moral code is not even a joke any more ; it 's just a memory '' ; two years later variety followed suit on june 13 , 1934 , an amendment to the code was adopted which established the production code administration ( pca ) and required all films released on or after july 1 , 1934 , to obtain a certificate of approval before being released for more than thirty years , virtually all motion pictures produced in the united states adhered to the code the production code was not created or enforced by federal , state , or city government ; the hollywood studios adopted the code in large part in the hopes of avoiding government censorship , preferring self-regulation to government regulation '' thomas doherty , professor of american studies at brandeis university , has defined the code as '' the guilty are punished , the virtuous rewarded , the authority of church and state is legitimate , and the bonds of matrimony are sacred breen — a prominent catholic layman who had worked in public relations — was appointed head of the new production code administration ( pca ) under breen 's leadership of the pca , which lasted until his retirement in 1954 , enforcement of the production code became notoriously rigid the outlaw was denied a certificate of approval and kept out of theaters for years , because the film 's advertising focused particular attention on jane russell 's breasts the code began to weaken in the late 1940s , when the formerly taboo subjects of rape and miscegenation were allowed in johnny belinda ( 1948 ) and pinky ( 1949 ) , respectively in 1951 , the mpaa revised the code to make it more rigid ; the 1951 revisions spelled out more words and subjects that were prohibited some of hollywood ’ s creative class managed to find positives in the code ’ s limitations the first threat came from a new technology , television , which did not require americans to leave their house to watch moving pictures film distributor joseph burstyn released the film in the u.s in 1950 , and the case became known as the '' miracle decision '' because of its connection to rossellini 's film in 1956 , areas of the code were re-written to accept subjects such as miscegenation , adultery , and prostitution by 1962 , such subject matter was acceptable , and the original film was given a seal of approval the mpaa began working on a rating system , under which film restrictions would lessen exhibit at the university of virginia library , september 2000 – february 2001 pre-code hollywood : sex , immorality , and insurrection in american cinema 1930–1934 '' queering the ( new ) deal : lesbian and gay representation and the depression-era cultural politics of hollywood 's production code '' , cinema journal ( 38 ) 2 : pp

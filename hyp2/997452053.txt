some isp clients whose providers were listed on spews took umbrage that their own ip addresses were associated with spamming , and that their mail might be blocked by users of the spews data ; often they did not understand that it was their provider that was listed there was no way for either the customer or the provider to contact spews , and spews claimed that the listings would be removed only when the associated abuse stopped dnsbl lists spews database status as dead since spews became inactive , the anonymous postmaster early warning system ( apews ) has taken its place , using similar listing criteria and a nearly identical web page the precise process by which spews gathered data about spam sources is unknown to the public , and it is likely that its operators used multiple techniques spews seemed to collect some information from honeypotsâ€”mail servers or single email addresses to which no legitimate mail is received the spews website made it clear that when spam was received , the operators filed a complaint with the isp or other site responsible for the spam source this process was repeated , conceivably until the entire netblock owned by the offending service provider was listed or the block was large enough that the service provider is encouraged to take action by the complaints of its paying customers for instance , part of an isp 's network may have been listed in spews for providing dns service to a domain mentioned in a piece of e-mail spam , even if the messages were n't sent from said provider 's mail servers a spews listing only caused mail to be refused if the recipient of the email ( or their isp ) chose to block based on the spews ip list in this view , the claims that lists such as spews are advisory and that spews itself did not block were seen as attempts to evade responsibility for spews 's own actions by the accounts of many of those regulars , spews could detect automatically when such support stopped , but this was not supported by any information in the spews faq

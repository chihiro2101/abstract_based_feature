spews itself published a large text file containing its listings , and operated a database where web users could query the reasons for a listing for instance , many mail sites used the spews data provided at spews.relays.osirusoft.com some isp clients whose providers were listed on spews took umbrage that their own ip addresses were associated with spamming , and that their mail might be blocked by users of the spews data ; often they did not understand that it was their provider that was listed there was no way for either the customer or the provider to contact spews , and spews claimed that the listings would be removed only when the associated abuse stopped dnsbl lists spews database status as dead since spews became inactive , the anonymous postmaster early warning system ( apews ) has taken its place , using similar listing criteria and a nearly identical web page however , spews was anonymous—when these complaints were sent , they were not marked as being from spews , and the site was not told that ignoring the complaint would result in a listing this had the effect of determining the isp 's response to a normal user 's spam complaint , and also discouraged listwashing—continuing to spam , but with the complaining address removed from the target list spews criteria were based on '' spam support '' ; when a network operation provided any services to the identified spammers , the resources involved were listed for instance , part of an isp 's network may have been listed in spews for providing dns service to a domain mentioned in a piece of e-mail spam , even if the messages were n't sent from said provider 's mail servers a spews listing only caused mail to be refused if the recipient of the email ( or their isp ) chose to block based on the spews ip list in this view , the claims that lists such as spews are advisory and that spews itself did not block were seen as attempts to evade responsibility for spews 's own actions

some isp clients whose providers were listed on spews took umbrage that their own ip addresses were associated with spamming , and that their mail might be blocked by users of the spews data ; often they did not understand that it was their provider that was listed there was no way for either the customer or the provider to contact spews , and spews claimed that the listings would be removed only when the associated abuse stopped dnsbl lists spews database status as dead since spews became inactive , the anonymous postmaster early warning system ( apews ) has taken its place , using similar listing criteria and a nearly identical web page the precise process by which spews gathered data about spam sources is unknown to the public , and it is likely that its operators used multiple techniques spews seemed to collect some information from honeypots—mail servers or single email addresses to which no legitimate mail is received the spews website made it clear that when spam was received , the operators filed a complaint with the isp or other site responsible for the spam source this had the effect of determining the isp 's response to a normal user 's spam complaint , and also discouraged listwashing—continuing to spam , but with the complaining address removed from the target list spews criteria were based on '' spam support '' ; when a network operation provided any services to the identified spammers , the resources involved were listed supporters responded that spews was a list of isps with spam problems a spews listing only caused mail to be refused if the recipient of the email ( or their isp ) chose to block based on the spews ip list in this view , the claims that lists such as spews are advisory and that spews itself did not block were seen as attempts to evade responsibility for spews 's own actions

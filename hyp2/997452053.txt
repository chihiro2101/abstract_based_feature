spews itself published a large text file containing its listings , and operated a database where web users could query the reasons for a listing for instance , many mail sites used the spews data provided at spews.relays.osirusoft.com some isp clients whose providers were listed on spews took umbrage that their own ip addresses were associated with spamming , and that their mail might be blocked by users of the spews data ; often they did not understand that it was their provider that was listed dnsbl lists spews database status as dead since spews became inactive , the anonymous postmaster early warning system ( apews ) has taken its place , using similar listing criteria and a nearly identical web page the precise process by which spews gathered data about spam sources is unknown to the public , and it is likely that its operators used multiple techniques the spews website made it clear that when spam was received , the operators filed a complaint with the isp or other site responsible for the spam source however , spews was anonymousâ€”when these complaints were sent , they were not marked as being from spews , and the site was not told that ignoring the complaint would result in a listing for instance , part of an isp 's network may have been listed in spews for providing dns service to a domain mentioned in a piece of e-mail spam , even if the messages were n't sent from said provider 's mail servers no one knows how many service providers used the spews list to reject mail a spews listing only caused mail to be refused if the recipient of the email ( or their isp ) chose to block based on the spews ip list in this view , the claims that lists such as spews are advisory and that spews itself did not block were seen as attempts to evade responsibility for spews 's own actions

miloš is a slavic given name recorded from the early middle ages among the bulgarians , czechs , poles and serbs in his history of montenegro ( 1754 ) , vasilije petrović wrote of one miloš obilijević , and in 1765 , the historian pavle julinac rendered the surname as obilić according to czech historian konstantin jireček , the surname obilić and its different renderings are derived from the serbian words obilan ( '' plenty of '' ) and obilje ( '' wealth , abundance '' ) : the surname kobilić could come from the slavic word kobila ( mare ) , and means '' mare 's son '' , as in serbian legends the hero is said to have been nursed by one based on a 1433 document from ragusan archives , the historian mihailo dinić concluded that miloš 's original surname was indeed kobilić miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as '' miloš of pocerje '' , and according to local legends , he came from the western serbian region of pocerina the earliest sources on the battle of kosovo , which generally favour the cult of prince lazar , do not mention miloš or his assassination of the sultan the assassination itself is first recorded by deacon ignjatije on 9 july 1389 , only 12 days after the battle the assassination of sultan murad and one of his sons was also mentioned in the instructions of the venetian senate issued to andrea bembo on 23 july 1389 , although venetians were uncertain if news about the assassination were true the assassin 's first appearance in serbian sources is in the biography of stefan lazarević , lazar 's son , by constantine of kostenets , written in the 1440s the initial phase of ignominy and its redemption by a courageous plot of slaying the sultan are narrative ingredients which would become essential to the serbian legend as it evolved in later times the loss of the sultan also made an impression on the earliest ottoman sources halil i̇nalcık explained that one of the most important contemporary ottomans sources about the battle of kosovo is the 1465 work of enveri i̇nalcık argued that it was based on the testimony of a contemporary eyewitness of the battle , probably hoca omer , an envoy sent by the sultan to lazar before the battle in this work enveri explains that before he became a serbian nobleman , miloš ( miloš ban is how i̇nalcık rendered the name in enveri 's text ) was a muslim at the sultan 's court who deserted ottomans and abjured islam since about the late 15th century , greek sources also begin to record the event in 1976 , miodrag popović suggested that the narrative elements of secrecy and stratagem in the serbian tradition were all introduced from turkish sources , seeking to defame the capabilities of their christian opponents by attributing the death of the murat to '' devious '' methods '' it is important to note that neither this chronicle nor any of the other early serbian accounts of the battle attributes murad 's death to the hand of an assassin ( ) the theme of assassination , which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from florence and siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century turkish sources for the battle , would eventually become a central element in the serbian epic ) it is surprising that the assassination of murad is not recorded in any of the serbian cult sources for the battle whatever the reason for this silence , it appears from later sources that the story of murad 's assassination was clearly known in lazar 's principality '' in 1512 ottoman historian mehmed nesri wrote a detailed account of the battle that became the source for later ottoman and western descriptions of the battle nesri 's account took several elements from popular serbian tradition , and described the assassination in a way which reflected negatively on the perpetrators miloš obilić is a major hero of the serbian legend of kosovo , whose central part is the battle of kosovo filled with hate , branković maligned miloš to lazar , saying that he conspired with turks to betray the prince at lazar 's supper on the eve of the battle , the prince reproached miloš for disloyalty in his 1603 work richard knolles described the serbian epic poetry about the battle of kosovo and refer to obilić as '' cobelitz '' another legend tells about the treason of vuk branković , serbian feudal lord and son-in-law of the serbian prince lazar later in the same century , the heroic figure of miloš was given a national boost in the epic poem the mountain wreath ( 1847 ) by petar ii petrović-njegoš , prince-bishop of montenegro the battle of kosovo

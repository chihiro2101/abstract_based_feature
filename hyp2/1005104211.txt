miloš is a slavic given name recorded from the early middle ages among the bulgarians , czechs , poles and serbs in his history of montenegro ( 1754 ) , vasilije petrović wrote of one miloš obilijević , and in 1765 , the historian pavle julinac rendered the surname as obilić according to czech historian konstantin jireček , the surname obilić and its different renderings are derived from the serbian words obilan ( '' plenty of '' ) and obilje ( '' wealth , abundance '' ) : the surname kobilić could come from the slavic word kobila ( mare ) , and means '' mare 's son '' , as in serbian legends the hero is said to have been nursed by one the rendering obilić has universally been used by serbian writers in modern times miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as '' miloš of pocerje '' , and according to local legends , he came from the western serbian region of pocerina in pocerina there is a spring known as '' miloševa banja '' ( miloš 's spring ) and an old grave that is claimed to be the grave of miloš 's sister the earliest sources on the battle of kosovo , which generally favour the cult of prince lazar , do not mention miloš or his assassination of the sultan another italian account , mignanelli 's 1416 work , asserted that it was lazar who killed the ottoman sultan the assassin 's first appearance in serbian sources is in the biography of stefan lazarević , lazar 's son , by constantine of kostenets , written in the 1440s the initial phase of ignominy and its redemption by a courageous plot of slaying the sultan are narrative ingredients which would become essential to the serbian legend as it evolved in later times in this work enveri explains that before he became a serbian nobleman , miloš ( miloš ban is how i̇nalcık rendered the name in enveri 's text ) was a muslim at the sultan 's court who deserted ottomans and abjured islam the sultan 's men cut miloš into pieces with swords and axes 1490 ) claims to draw on greek traditions when he refers to murad 's killer as miloes , '' a man of noble birth he requested what he needed from prince lazar , and then rode off to murad 's camp with the intention of presenting himself as a deserter murad , who was standing in the midst of his troops before the battle , was eager to receive the deserter he thinks that serbians knew about the assassination , but decided not to mention it in their first accounts for unknown reasons ) the theme of assassination , which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from florence and siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century turkish sources for the battle , would eventually become a central element in the serbian epic ) it is surprising that the assassination of murad is not recorded in any of the serbian cult sources for the battle miloš obilić is a major hero of the serbian legend of kosovo , whose central part is the battle of kosovo according to the legend , miloš was a son-in-law of the serbian prince lazar the legend then goes on to describe events regarding the battle in one view , its place of origin lies in the region in which the battle of kosovo was fought the nucleus from which the legend developed is found in the cultic literature celebrating prince lazar as a martyr and saint , written in moravian serbia between 1389 and 1420 the fully developed legend of kosovo , with all of its elements , is recorded in the tale of the battle of kosovo composed around the beginning of the 18th century in the bay of kotor or old montenegro in a passage intended to infer a moral lesson about disloyalty from the serbian defeat at kosovo , mihailović identifies miloš kobica as the knight who on the fateful last friday of the battle slew murad in his 1603 work richard knolles described the serbian epic poetry about the battle of kosovo and refer to obilić as '' cobelitz '' miloš obilić with milan toplica and ivan kosančić , miloš obilić with prince marko , miloš obilić with the jugović brothers during the serbian revolution ( 1804–1815 ) , a fresco of miloš as a haloed , sword-bearing saint was painted in prince lazar 's narthex in the hilandar monastery on mount athos ( greece ) a key event which gave expression to this idea was the 600th anniversary of the battle of kosovo ( vidovdan ) on 28 june 1989 , which was held at the gazimestan plain , near the site of the battle

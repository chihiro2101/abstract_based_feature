in his history of montenegro ( 1754 ) , vasilije petrović wrote of one miloš obilijević , and in 1765 , the historian pavle julinac rendered the surname as obilić according to czech historian konstantin jireček , the surname obilić and its different renderings are derived from the serbian words obilan ( '' plenty of '' ) and obilje ( '' wealth , abundance '' ) jireček connected the surname to two noble families in medieval ragusa and trebinje , the kobilić and kobiljačić in the 14th and 15th centuries , and noted that they altered their surnames in the 18th century because they considered it '' indecent '' to be associated with mares the rendering obilić has universally been used by serbian writers in modern times miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as '' miloš of pocerje '' , and according to local legends , he came from the western serbian region of pocerina the earliest sources on the battle of kosovo , which generally favour the cult of prince lazar , do not mention miloš or his assassination of the sultan the assassination of sultan murad and one of his sons was also mentioned in the instructions of the venetian senate issued to andrea bembo on 23 july 1389 , although venetians were uncertain if news about the assassination were true victory over the turks was also reported by coluccio salutati ( died 1406 ) , chancellor of florence , in his letter to king tvrtko , dated 20 october 1389 , on behalf of the florentine senate fortunate above all is that one who so forcefully killed such a strong vojvoda by stabbing him with a sword in the throat and belly another italian account , mignanelli 's 1416 work , asserted that it was lazar who killed the ottoman sultan the assassin 's first appearance in serbian sources is in the biography of stefan lazarević , lazar 's son , by constantine of kostenets , written in the 1440s the hero , still anonymous , is described as a man of noble birth whom envious tongues had sought to defame before the prince the loss of the sultan also made an impression on the earliest ottoman sources halil i̇nalcık explained that one of the most important contemporary ottomans sources about the battle of kosovo is the 1465 work of enveri i̇nalcık argued that it was based on the testimony of a contemporary eyewitness of the battle , probably hoca omer , an envoy sent by the sultan to lazar before the battle in this work enveri explains that before he became a serbian nobleman , miloš ( miloš ban is how i̇nalcık rendered the name in enveri 's text ) was a muslim at the sultan 's court who deserted ottomans and abjured islam according to this account , when lazar was captured , miloš approached the sultan who was riding a black stallion and said : '' i am miloš ban , i want to go back to my islamic faith and kiss your hand since about the late 15th century , greek sources also begin to record the event murad , who was standing in the midst of his troops before the battle , was eager to receive the deserter '' it is important to note that neither this chronicle nor any of the other early serbian accounts of the battle attributes murad 's death to the hand of an assassin ( ) the theme of assassination , which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from florence and siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century turkish sources for the battle , would eventually become a central element in the serbian epic ) it is surprising that the assassination of murad is not recorded in any of the serbian cult sources for the battle whatever the reason for this silence , it appears from later sources that the story of murad 's assassination was clearly known in lazar 's principality '' in 1512 ottoman historian mehmed nesri wrote a detailed account of the battle that became the source for later ottoman and western descriptions of the battle miloš obilić is a major hero of the serbian legend of kosovo , whose central part is the battle of kosovo according to the legend , miloš was a son-in-law of the serbian prince lazar as a consequence of this , branković took offence and picked a fight with miloš in his 1603 work richard knolles described the serbian epic poetry about the battle of kosovo and refer to obilić as '' cobelitz '' it was not until the early 19th century that miloš was also venerated as a saint in the serbian church a key event which gave expression to this idea was the 600th anniversary of the battle of kosovo ( vidovdan ) on 28 june 1989 , which was held at the gazimestan plain , near the site of the battle

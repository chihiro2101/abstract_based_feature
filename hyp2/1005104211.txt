miloš is a slavic given name recorded from the early middle ages among the bulgarians , czechs , poles and serbs in his history of montenegro ( 1754 ) , vasilije petrović wrote of one miloš obilijević , and in 1765 , the historian pavle julinac rendered the surname as obilić according to czech historian konstantin jireček , the surname obilić and its different renderings are derived from the serbian words obilan ( '' plenty of '' ) and obilje ( '' wealth , abundance '' ) : the surname kobilić could come from the slavic word kobila ( mare ) , and means '' mare 's son '' , as in serbian legends the hero is said to have been nursed by one jireček connected the surname to two noble families in medieval ragusa and trebinje , the kobilić and kobiljačić in the 14th and 15th centuries , and noted that they altered their surnames in the 18th century because they considered it '' indecent '' to be associated with mares based on a 1433 document from ragusan archives , the historian mihailo dinić concluded that miloš 's original surname was indeed kobilić miloš is often referred to in the epic poems as '' miloš of pocerje '' , and according to local legends , he came from the western serbian region of pocerina the earliest sources on the battle of kosovo , which generally favour the cult of prince lazar , do not mention miloš or his assassination of the sultan the assassination of sultan murad and one of his sons was also mentioned in the instructions of the venetian senate issued to andrea bembo on 23 july 1389 , although venetians were uncertain if news about the assassination were true the hero , still anonymous , is described as a man of noble birth whom envious tongues had sought to defame before the prince to prove his loyalty and courage , he left the front line on the pretext of being a deserter , seized the opportunity to stab the sultan to death and was killed himself shortly afterwards the initial phase of ignominy and its redemption by a courageous plot of slaying the sultan are narrative ingredients which would become essential to the serbian legend as it evolved in later times in the early 15th century , for instance , the poet ahmedi writes that '' suddenly one of the christians , who was covered in blood and apparently hidden among the enemy dead , got up , rushed to murad and stabbed him with a dagger halil i̇nalcık explained that one of the most important contemporary ottomans sources about the battle of kosovo is the 1465 work of enveri i̇nalcık argued that it was based on the testimony of a contemporary eyewitness of the battle , probably hoca omer , an envoy sent by the sultan to lazar before the battle in this work enveri explains that before he became a serbian nobleman , miloš ( miloš ban is how i̇nalcık rendered the name in enveri 's text ) was a muslim at the sultan 's court who deserted ottomans and abjured islam since about the late 15th century , greek sources also begin to record the event he requested what he needed from prince lazar , and then rode off to murad 's camp with the intention of presenting himself as a deserter emmert says that turkish sources mentioned the assassination several times , while western and serbian sources did n't mention it until much later ) the theme of assassination , which appeared in the contemporary accounts of the battle from florence and siena and was also an important theme in all of the fifteenth century turkish sources for the battle , would eventually become a central element in the serbian epic according to the legend , miloš was a son-in-law of the serbian prince lazar at lazar 's supper on the eve of the battle , the prince reproached miloš for disloyalty in one view , its place of origin lies in the region in which the battle of kosovo was fought especially important in this regard is the discourse on prince lazar composed by serbian patriarch danilo iii the tale of the maligned hero who penetrated the turkish camp and killed sultan murad , is found in the life of despot stefan lazarević written in the 1430s by konstantin the philosopher the theme of the quarrel between lazar 's sons-in-law was first recorded in herzegovina in the mid-15th century the fully developed legend of kosovo , with all of its elements , is recorded in the tale of the battle of kosovo composed around the beginning of the 18th century in the bay of kotor or old montenegro miloš obilić with milan toplica and ivan kosančić , miloš obilić with prince marko , miloš obilić with the jugović brothers the idiom addresses the issue of quantity prevailing over quality as a sad fact of life , since obilić was outnumbered by the enemies ; primary sources deacon ignjatije wrote a description of the battle on 27 june 1389 , only 12 days after the battle

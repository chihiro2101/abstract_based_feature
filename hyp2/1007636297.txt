later on this configuration process was automated : plug and play the msx system , released in 1983 , was designed to be plug and play from the ground up , and achieved this by a system of slots and subslots , where each had its own virtual address space , thus eliminating device addressing conflicts in its very source no jumpers or any manual configuration was required , and the independent address space for each slot allowed very cheap and commonplace chips to be used , alongside cheap glue logic in 1984 , the nubus architecture was developed by the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) as a platform agnostic peripheral interface that fully automated device configuration configuration information was stored on a read-only device on each peripheral , and at boot time the host system allocated the requested resources to the installed card in time , many industry standard architecture ( isa ) cards incorporated , through proprietary and varied techniques , hardware to self-configure or to provide for software configuration ; often , the card came with a configuration program on disk that could automatically set the software-configurable ( but not itself self-configuring ) hardware isa pnp or ( legacy ) plug & play isa was a plug-and-play system that used a combination of modifications to hardware , the system bios , and operating system software to automatically manage resource allocations in 1995 , microsoft released windows 95 , which tried to automate device detection and configuration as much as possible , but could still fall back to manual settings if necessary the windows 95 device manager also could offer users a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices although both firewire and usb have bandwidth that must be shared by all devices , most modern operating systems are unable to monitor and report the amount of bandwidth being used or available , or to identify which devices are currently using the interface .

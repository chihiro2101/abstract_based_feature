some early microcomputer peripheral devices required the end user physically to cut some wires and solder together others in order to make configuration changes ; such changes were intended to be largely permanent for the life of the hardware later on this configuration process was automated : plug and play on the software side , the drivers and extensions were supplied in the card 's own rom , thus requiring no disks or any kind of user intervention to configure the software the specification was sufficiently intelligent that it could work with both endianness and little endian computer platforms that had previously been mutually incompatible anyone developing for mca had to sign non-disclosure agreements and pay royalties to ibm for each device sold , putting a price premium on mca devices isa pnp or ( legacy ) plug & play isa was a plug-and-play system that used a combination of modifications to hardware , the system bios , and operating system software to automatically manage resource allocations scott mueller , upgrading and repairing pcs , eleventh edition , que , 2999 , , page 1370 at the time , there could be a mix of devices in a system , some capable of automatic configuration , and some still using fully manual settings via jumpers and dip switches the windows 95 device manager also could offer users a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration the unreliability of the device installation process led to plug and play being sometimes referred to as plug and pray until approximately 2000 , pc computers could still be purchased with a mix of isa and pci slots , so it was still possible that manual isa device configuration might be necessary several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices

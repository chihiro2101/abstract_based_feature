some early microcomputer peripheral devices required the end user physically to cut some wires and solder together others in order to make configuration changes ; such changes were intended to be largely permanent for the life of the hardware later on this configuration process was automated : plug and play the msx system , released in 1983 , was designed to be plug and play from the ground up , and achieved this by a system of slots and subslots , where each had its own virtual address space , thus eliminating device addressing conflicts in its very source on the software side , the drivers and extensions were supplied in the card 's own rom , thus requiring no disks or any kind of user intervention to configure the software the user would install the device , turn on the computer , load the configuration information from the disk , and the hardware automatically assigned interrupts , dma , and other needed settings isa pnp or ( legacy ) plug & play isa was a plug-and-play system that used a combination of modifications to hardware , the system bios , and operating system software to automatically manage resource allocations in 1995 , microsoft released windows 95 , which tried to automate device detection and configuration as much as possible , but could still fall back to manual settings if necessary scott mueller , upgrading and repairing pcs , eleventh edition , que , 2999 , , page 1370 at the time , there could be a mix of devices in a system , some capable of automatic configuration , and some still using fully manual settings via jumpers and dip switches until approximately 2000 , pc computers could still be purchased with a mix of isa and pci slots , so it was still possible that manual isa device configuration might be necessary several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices although both firewire and usb have bandwidth that must be shared by all devices , most modern operating systems are unable to monitor and report the amount of bandwidth being used or available , or to identify which devices are currently using the interface .

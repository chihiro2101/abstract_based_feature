some early microcomputer peripheral devices required the end user physically to cut some wires and solder together others in order to make configuration changes ; such changes were intended to be largely permanent for the life of the hardware later on this configuration process was automated : plug and play no jumpers or any manual configuration was required , and the independent address space for each slot allowed very cheap and commonplace chips to be used , alongside cheap glue logic in 1984 , the nubus architecture was developed by the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) as a platform agnostic peripheral interface that fully automated device configuration configuration information was stored on a read-only device on each peripheral , and at boot time the host system allocated the requested resources to the installed card the zorro architecture did not spread to general computing use outside of the amiga product line , but was eventually upgraded as zorro ii and zorro iii for the later iteration of amiga computers the user would install the device , turn on the computer , load the configuration information from the disk , and the hardware automatically assigned interrupts , dma , and other needed settings in time , many industry standard architecture ( isa ) cards incorporated , through proprietary and varied techniques , hardware to self-configure or to provide for software configuration ; often , the card came with a configuration program on disk that could automatically set the software-configurable ( but not itself self-configuring ) hardware isa pnp or ( legacy ) plug & play isa was a plug-and-play system that used a combination of modifications to hardware , the system bios , and operating system software to automatically manage resource allocations the windows 95 device manager also could offer users a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices

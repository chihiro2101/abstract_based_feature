some early microcomputer peripheral devices required the end user physically to cut some wires and solder together others in order to make configuration changes ; such changes were intended to be largely permanent for the life of the hardware later on this configuration process was automated : plug and play the msx system , released in 1983 , was designed to be plug and play from the ground up , and achieved this by a system of slots and subslots , where each had its own virtual address space , thus eliminating device addressing conflicts in its very source no jumpers or any manual configuration was required , and the independent address space for each slot allowed very cheap and commonplace chips to be used , alongside cheap glue logic on the software side , the drivers and extensions were supplied in the card 's own rom , thus requiring no disks or any kind of user intervention to configure the software in 1984 , commodore developed the autoconfig protocol and the zorro expansion bus for its amiga line of expandable computers configuration information was stored on a read-only device on each peripheral , and at boot time the host system allocated the requested resources to the installed card thumb in 1987 , ibm released an update to the ibm pc known as the personal system/2 line of computers using the micro channel architecture the windows 95 device manager also could offer users a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration until approximately 2000 , pc computers could still be purchased with a mix of isa and pci slots , so it was still possible that manual isa device configuration might be necessary several completely automated computer interfaces are currently used , each of which requires no device configuration or other action on the part of the computer user , apart from software installation , for the self-configuring devices

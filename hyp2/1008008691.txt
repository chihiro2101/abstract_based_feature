strabo and diodorus siculus write that the city was situated close to the sea and lay between the crathis and sybaris rivers ( from which the city derives its name ) today the coscile feeds into the crati about five kilometers from its mouth , which then passes just south of the archaeological site of the city foundation in 720 bc sybaris was founded in 720 & nbsp ; bc according to pseudo-scymnus strabo mentions it was an achaean colony and that its oekist ( founder ) was is of helike , a city in achaea this has been interpreted as a confirmation of strabo 's account because poseidonia is thought to be a colony of sybaris this number of inhabitants was certainly exaggerated but sybaris was nonetheless a linchpin of magna graecia furthermore , he explains that sybaris was a dominant power in the region which ruled over four tribes and twenty-five subject cities the oenotrian city pandosia was one of the settlements which seems to have been controlled by sybaris sybaris extended its dominion across the peninsula to the tyrrhenian sea , where it is thought to have founded its colonies paestum , la√ºs and scidrus poseidonia was founded in approximately 600 bc , but it is unknown when the latter two colonies were founded descriptions of the wealth and luxury of sybaris are plenty in the ancient literature he sailed from sybaris to sicyon in a ship of fifty oars manned by his own slaves and surpassed even cleisthenes himself in luxury justin mentions an alliance of sybaris with the other achaean colonies metapontum and kroton against the ionian colony siris in the second half of the sixth century bc sybaris started minting its first coins , of which the oldest have been dated to approximately 530 bc subjugation by kroton in 510/09 bc the exiled citizens took refuge at the altars of kroton it is assumed some also fled to poseidonia , because in the early fifth century poseidonia 's coins adopted the achaean weight standard and the bull seen on sybarite coins '' alliance '' coins show the tripod symbol of kroton on one side and the bull symbol of sybaris on the other side diodorus siculus mentions that kroton besieged sybaris again in 476/5 & nbsp ; bc diodorus writes that the sybarites refounded their city at its former site in 452/1 & nbsp ; bc under the leadership of a thessalian it is thought that poseidonia had a major share in this because the coins of the new city have a great resemblance to those of poseidonia with the help of athens and some other cities in the peloponnese they founded the city of thurii not far from the site of sybaris in 444/3 & nbsp ; bc the athenians and other new colonists then turned the city into a new foundation called thurii it was found that the later cities of thurii and copia were built partially above sybaris

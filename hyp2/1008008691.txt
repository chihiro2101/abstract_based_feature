strabo and diodorus siculus write that the city was situated close to the sea and lay between the crathis and sybaris rivers ( from which the city derives its name ) most modern research places the city on a coastal ridge near a wetland lagoon today the coscile feeds into the crati about five kilometers from its mouth , which then passes just south of the archaeological site of the city when sybaris was still populated the coscile pursued a direct course into the gulf of taranto , probably at a short distance to the north sybaris was founded in 720 & nbsp ; bc according to pseudo-scymnus strabo mentions it was an achaean colony and that its oekist ( founder ) was is of helike , a city in achaea according to legend the city was founded by sagaris , the son of oïlean ajax strabo is the only source for the name of the oekist , which might be a corruption of sagaris or sybaris this has been interpreted as a confirmation of strabo 's account because poseidonia is thought to be a colony of sybaris diodorus siculus describes how sybaris had amassed great wealth and a huge population as a result of its fertile farming land and its policy of admitting aliens to its citizenry this number of inhabitants was certainly exaggerated but sybaris was nonetheless a linchpin of magna graecia the inhabited area of the city occupied approximately the oenotrian city pandosia was one of the settlements which seems to have been controlled by sybaris sybaris extended its dominion across the peninsula to the tyrrhenian sea , where it is thought to have founded its colonies paestum , laüs and scidrus he sailed from sybaris to sicyon in a ship of fifty oars manned by his own slaves and surpassed even cleisthenes himself in luxury justin mentions an alliance of sybaris with the other achaean colonies metapontum and kroton against the ionian colony siris in the second half of the sixth century bc sybaris started minting its first coins , of which the oldest have been dated to approximately 530 bc these coins employed the achaean weight standard which was shared with the other achaean colonies kroton , caulonia and metapontum diodorus siculus writes that the oligarchy government of the city was overthrown in 510/09 & nbsp ; bc by a popular leader named telys ( herodotus describes him as a tyrant the army sizes given by diodorus ( shared with strabo ) must have been even more exaggerated than the population size soon a conflict arose between the sybarites and the other colonists of thurii over the privileges the sybarites enjoyed in 444/3 & nbsp ; bc the athenians and other new colonists then turned the city into a new foundation called thurii later he cites phylarchus , who would have written that the sybarites invoked the anger of hera when they murdered thirty ambassadors from kroton and left them unburied he points out the vast natural wealth of the city was the more likely reason it was attacked by kroton the earliest archaeological exploration in the last quarter of the 19th century failed to find the location of sybaris

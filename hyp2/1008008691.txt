strabo and diodorus siculus write that the city was situated close to the sea and lay between the crathis and sybaris rivers ( from which the city derives its name ) today the coscile feeds into the crati about five kilometers from its mouth , which then passes just south of the archaeological site of the city sybaris was founded in 720 & nbsp ; bc according to pseudo-scymnus strabo mentions it was an achaean colony and that its oekist ( founder ) was is of helike , a city in achaea strabo is the only source for the name of the oekist , which might be a corruption of sagaris or sybaris this has been interpreted as a confirmation of strabo 's account because poseidonia is thought to be a colony of sybaris diodorus siculus describes how sybaris had amassed great wealth and a huge population as a result of its fertile farming land and its policy of admitting aliens to its citizenry this number of inhabitants was certainly exaggerated but sybaris was nonetheless a linchpin of magna graecia strabo writes that its inhabitants on the crathis occupied a circuit of fifty stadia ( over poseidonia was founded in approximately 600 bc , but it is unknown when the latter two colonies were founded descriptions of the wealth and luxury of sybaris are plenty in the ancient literature he sailed from sybaris to sicyon in a ship of fifty oars manned by his own slaves and surpassed even cleisthenes himself in luxury justin mentions an alliance of sybaris with the other achaean colonies metapontum and kroton against the ionian colony siris in the second half of the sixth century bc sybaris started minting its first coins , of which the oldest have been dated to approximately 530 bc the exiled citizens took refuge at the altars of kroton the army sizes given by diodorus ( shared with strabo ) must have been even more exaggerated than the population size even though they were greatly outnumbered , the krotoniates won the battle and took no prisoners , killing most of the sybarites most likely the sybarites executed telys and his supporters during this time if strabo 's claim is true , that material would have been deposited as sediment above the city when the river submerged it an analysis of core samples taken from the site did not find such river deposits directly above the former city literary evidence from aristoxenus attests of pythagoreans who apparently moved to sybaris after its subjugation by kroton diodorus siculus mentions that kroton besieged sybaris again in 476/5 & nbsp ; bc diodorus writes that the sybarites refounded their city at its former site in 452/1 & nbsp ; bc under the leadership of a thessalian with the help of athens and some other cities in the peloponnese they founded the city of thurii not far from the site of sybaris aelianus , strabo and especially athenaeus saw the destruction of sybaris as divine vengeance upon the sybarites for their pride , arrogance , and excessive luxury

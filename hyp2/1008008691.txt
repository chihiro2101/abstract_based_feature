strabo and diodorus siculus write that the city was situated close to the sea and lay between the crathis and sybaris rivers ( from which the city derives its name ) most modern research places the city on a coastal ridge near a wetland lagoon today the coscile feeds into the crati about five kilometers from its mouth , which then passes just south of the archaeological site of the city foundation in 720 bc sybaris was founded in 720 & nbsp ; bc according to pseudo-scymnus strabo mentions it was an achaean colony and that its oekist ( founder ) was is of helike , a city in achaea strabo is the only source for the name of the oekist , which might be a corruption of sagaris or sybaris this has been interpreted as a confirmation of strabo 's account because poseidonia is thought to be a colony of sybaris this number of inhabitants was certainly exaggerated but sybaris was nonetheless a linchpin of magna graecia the oenotrian city pandosia was one of the settlements which seems to have been controlled by sybaris in the second half of the seventh century bc the sybarites apparently took over the sanctuary of athena on the timpone della motta from the oenotrians they celebrated large festivals regularly on this hill , which was located 15 kilometers to the northwest of their city sybaris extended its dominion across the peninsula to the tyrrhenian sea , where it is thought to have founded its colonies paestum , la√ºs and scidrus poseidonia was founded in approximately 600 bc , but it is unknown when the latter two colonies were founded in the second half of the sixth century bc sybaris started minting its first coins , of which the oldest have been dated to approximately 530 bc most likely the sybarites executed telys and his supporters during this time an analysis of core samples taken from the site did not find such river deposits directly above the former city regardless of the results of the siege of 476 & nbsp ; bc , it seems the sybarites had to leave their city at some point between that year and 452/1 & nbsp ; bc ultimately the sybarites were again driven off by the krotoniates from their new city in 446/5 & nbsp ; bc final expulsion in 445 & nbsp ; bc some of the sybarites managed to flee and founded sybaris on the traeis shortly after 444 & nbsp ; bc in the summer of 445 & nbsp ; bc the collision between the two groups led to the downfall of the sybarites the city received a new democratic constitution which made provisions for ten tribes , but which did not include the sybarites the location of the city was found only after a massive core drilling project had been undertaken from the early to mid-1960s it was found that the later cities of thurii and copia were built partially above sybaris

the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu kanmu first tried to move the capital to nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to heian the japanese missions to tang china were suspended and the influx of chinese exports halted , a fact which facilitated the independent growth of japanese culture called therefore , the heian period is considered a high point in japanese culture that later generations have always admired the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan the warrior class made steady political gains throughout the heian period at this time taira no kiyomori revived the fujiwara practices by placing his grandson on the throne to rule japan by regency the kamakura period began in 1185 when minamoto no yoritomo seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in kamakura when emperor kanmu moved the capital to heian-kyō ( kyoto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the buddhist institutions there the early heian period ( 784–967 ) continued nara culture ; the heian capital was patterned on the china tang capital at chang'an , takei and keane 2001 p known as the ritsuryō code , this system attempted to recreate the tang legal system in japan , despite the '' tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries '' although kanmu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the emishi , possible descendants of the displaced jōmon , living in northern and eastern japan imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best , however stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more nevertheless , the fujiwara were not demoted by daigo but actually became stronger during his reign by the year 1000 , fujiwara no michinaga was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will little authority was left for traditional institutions , and government affairs were handled through the fujiwara clan 's private administration despite their usurpation of imperial authority , the fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy vividly colored yamato-e , japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid-to-late heian period , setting patterns for japanese art to this day new institutions were now needed in the face of social , economic , and political changes as the most powerful family , the fujiwara governed japan and determined the general affairs of state , such as succession to the throne family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed , a pattern followed among other families , monasteries , and even the imperial family this gave rise to the japanese military class mutual interests , family connections , and kinship were consolidated in military groups that became part of family administration these military families gained prestige from connections to the imperial court and court-granted military titles and access to manpower the fujiwara family , taira clan , and minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class the fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of emperor go-sanjō ( 1068–1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a fujiwara mother since the ninth century go-sanjo , determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule , implemented reforms to curb fujiwara influence rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making in time , many of the fujiwara were replaced , mostly by members of the rising minamoto clan the period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the in-no-chō and of the rise of the military class throughout the country in the end , the fujiwara were destroyed , the old system of government supplanted , and the insei system left powerless as bushi took control of court affairs , marking a turning point in japanese history taira no kiyomori emerged as the real power in japan following the fujiwara 's destruction , and he would remain in command for the next 20 years although written chinese ( kanbun ) remained the official language of the heian period imperial court , the introduction and widespread use of kana saw a boom in japanese literature while on one hand , the heian period was an unusually long period of peace , it can also be argued that the period weakened japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants traditional horseback archery ( yabusame ) festivals , which date from the beginning of the kamakura period ( immediately following the heian period ) feature similar dress heian period court and clan shively , d ) , the cambridge history of modern japan ;

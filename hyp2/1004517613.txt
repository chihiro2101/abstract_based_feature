the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu kanmu first tried to move the capital to nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to heian the japanese missions to tang china were suspended and the influx of chinese exports halted , a fact which facilitated the independent growth of japanese culture called therefore , the heian period is considered a high point in japanese culture that later generations have always admired the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan nominally , sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact , power was wielded by the fujiwara nobility still , a true military takeover of the japanese government was centuries away , when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate at this time taira no kiyomori revived the fujiwara practices by placing his grandson on the throne to rule japan by regency when emperor kanmu moved the capital to heian-kyō ( kyoto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically the early heian period ( 784–967 ) continued nara culture ; the heian capital was patterned on the china tang capital at chang'an , takei and keane 2001 p kanmu 's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles , and he became recognized as one of japan 's most forceful emperors although kanmu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the emishi , possible descendants of the displaced jōmon , living in northern and eastern japan after making temporary gains in 794 , in 797 , kanmu appointed a new commander , sakanoue no tamuramaro , under the title seii taishōgun ( '' barbarian-subduing generalissimo '' ) stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more through the new emperor 's private office , the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before the new metropolitan police board replaced the largely ceremonial imperial guard units nevertheless , the fujiwara were not demoted by daigo but actually became stronger during his reign central control of japan had continued to decline , and the fujiwara , along with other great families and religious foundations , acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century by the early heian period , the shōen had obtained legal status , and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity , waiver of taxes , and immunity from government inspection of the shōen they held those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to shōen holders in return for a share of the harvest despite their usurpation of imperial authority , the fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and , with it , to the rise in japan 's famous vernacular literature , much of it written by court women who had not been trained in chinese as had their male counterparts indigenous art also flourished under the fujiwara after centuries of imitating chinese forms vividly colored yamato-e , japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the mid-to-late heian period , setting patterns for japanese art to this day whereas the first phase of shōen development in the early heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions , the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial '' house governments '' , as in the old clan system in fact , the form of the old clan system had remained largely intact within the great old centralized government at that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi , which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi , which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks in time , large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures a decline in food production , the growth of the population , and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries members of the fujiwara , taira , and minamoto families—all of whom had descended from the imperial family—attacked one another , claimed control over vast tracts of conquered land , set up rival regimes , and generally upset the peace the fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of emperor go-sanjō ( 1068–1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a fujiwara mother since the ninth century rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making while the fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions , the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne a struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power in 1159 , the taira and minamoto clashed ( heiji rebellion ) , and a twenty-year period of taira ascendancy began kiyomori filled no less than 50 government posts with his relatives , rebuilt the inland sea , and encouraged trade with song china although written chinese ( kanbun ) remained the official language of the heian period imperial court , the introduction and widespread use of kana saw a boom in japanese literature the lyrics of the modern japanese national anthem , kimigayo , were written in the heian period , as was the tale of genji by murasaki shikibu , one of the first novels ever written heian art at the new york metropolitan museum of art heian art and calligraphy at the tokyo national museum heian art at the british museum

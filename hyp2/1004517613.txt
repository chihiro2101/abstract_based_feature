the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu kanmu first tried to move the capital to nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to heian the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan nominally , sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact , power was wielded by the fujiwara nobility the warrior class made steady political gains throughout the heian period as early as 939 ce , taira no masakado threatened the authority of the central government , leading an uprising in the eastern province of hitachi , and almost simultaneously , fujiwara no sumitomo rebelled in the west still , a true military takeover of the japanese government was centuries away , when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate at this time taira no kiyomori revived the fujiwara practices by placing his grandson on the throne to rule japan by regency the kamakura period began in 1185 when minamoto no yoritomo seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in kamakura when emperor kanmu moved the capital to heian-kyō ( kyoto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of dōkyō and the encroaching secular power of the buddhist institutions there the early heian period ( 784–967 ) continued nara culture ; the heian capital was patterned on the china tang capital at chang'an , takei and keane 2001 p despite the decline of the taika–taihō reforms , imperial government was vigorous during the early heian period kanmu 's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles , and he became recognized as one of japan 's most forceful emperors although kanmu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the emishi , possible descendants of the displaced jōmon , living in northern and eastern japan as the soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the emperor 's private office for a time , however , during the reign of emperor daigo ( 897–930 ) , the fujiwara regency was suspended as he ruled directly central control of japan had continued to decline , and the fujiwara , along with other great families and religious foundations , acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century by the early heian period , the shōen had obtained legal status , and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity , waiver of taxes , and immunity from government inspection of the shōen they held there was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature three late-tenth-century and early-11th-century women presented their views of life and romance at the heian court in kagerō nikki by '' the mother of michitsuna no haha '' , the pillow book by sei shōnagon and the tale of genji by murasaki shikibu indigenous art also flourished under the fujiwara after centuries of imitating chinese forms land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy , not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of japan as a single nation under the early courts , when military conscription had been centrally controlled , military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy gradually , the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite of samurai in time , large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures a decline in food production , the growth of the population , and competition for resources among the great families all led to the gradual decline of fujiwara power and gave rise to military disturbances in the mid-tenth and eleventh centuries the fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of emperor go-sanjō ( 1068–1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a fujiwara mother since the ninth century go-sanjo , determined to restore imperial control through strong personal rule , implemented reforms to curb fujiwara influence rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making while the fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions , the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne the period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the in-no-chō and of the rise of the military class throughout the country a struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power in 1159 , the taira and minamoto clashed ( heiji rebellion ) , and a twenty-year period of taira ascendancy began the taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces , where the minamoto clan were rebuilding their strength the heian period saw the rise of two esoteric buddhist sects , tendai and shingon although written chinese ( kanbun ) remained the official language of the heian period imperial court , the introduction and widespread use of kana saw a boom in japanese literature the player is able to choose one of the most powerful families of japan at the time , the taira , minamoto or fujiwara ;

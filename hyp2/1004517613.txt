the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu kanmu first tried to move the capital to nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to heian the japanese missions to tang china were suspended and the influx of chinese exports halted , a fact which facilitated the independent growth of japanese culture called therefore , the heian period is considered a high point in japanese culture that later generations have always admired the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan however , to protect their interests in the provinces , the fujiwara , and other noble families required guards , police and soldiers still , a true military takeover of the japanese government was centuries away , when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate when emperor kanmu moved the capital to heian-kyō ( kyoto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically kanmu endeavored to improve the tang-style administrative system which was in use despite the decline of the taika–taihō reforms , imperial government was vigorous during the early heian period stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more following kanmu 's death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons , two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the taika–taihō administrative structure through the new emperor 's private office , the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before japan began to turn inward as the soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the emperor 's private office toward the end of the 9th century , several emperors tried but failed , to check the fujiwara those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to shōen holders in return for a share of the harvest people and lands were increasingly beyond central control and taxation , a de facto return to conditions before the taika reform by the year 1000 , fujiwara no michinaga was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will despite their usurpation of imperial authority , the fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy hiragana gave written expression to the spoken word and , with it , to the rise in japan 's famous vernacular literature , much of it written by court women who had not been trained in chinese as had their male counterparts as the most powerful family , the fujiwara governed japan and determined the general affairs of state , such as succession to the throne family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed , a pattern followed among other families , monasteries , and even the imperial family land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy , not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of japan as a single nation under the early courts , when military conscription had been centrally controlled , military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy this gave rise to the japanese military class in time , large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures the fujiwara family , taira clan , and minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class the fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of emperor go-sanjō ( 1068–1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a fujiwara mother since the ninth century he also established an office to compile and validate estate records with the aim of reasserting central control the in-no-chō filled the void left by the decline of fujiwara power a struggle for succession in the mid-twelfth century gave the fujiwara an opportunity to regain their former power fujiwara no yorinaga sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1156 against the heir apparent , who was supported by the taira and minamoto ( hōgen rebellion )

the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu kanmu first tried to move the capital to nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to heian the japanese missions to tang china were suspended and the influx of chinese exports halted , a fact which facilitated the independent growth of japanese culture called therefore , the heian period is considered a high point in japanese culture that later generations have always admired the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan nominally , sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact , power was wielded by the fujiwara nobility the warrior class made steady political gains throughout the heian period still , a true military takeover of the japanese government was centuries away , when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate the kamakura period began in 1185 when minamoto no yoritomo seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in kamakura when emperor kanmu moved the capital to heian-kyō ( kyoto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically known as the ritsuryō code , this system attempted to recreate the tang legal system in japan , despite the '' tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries '' although kanmu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the emishi , possible descendants of the displaced jōmon , living in northern and eastern japan in the ninth and tenth centuries , much authority was lost to the great families , who disregarded the chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in kyoto following kanmu 's death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons , two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the taika–taihō administrative structure through the new emperor 's private office , the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self-assurance than before while these two offices strengthened the emperor 's position temporarily , soon they and other chinese-style structures were bypassed in the developing state tang china was in a state of decline , and chinese buddhists were severely persecuted , undermining japanese respect for chinese institutions as the soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the emperor 's private office another fujiwara became regent , sesshō for his grandson , then a minor emperor and yet another was appointed kampaku toward the end of the 9th century , several emperors tried but failed , to check the fujiwara for a time , however , during the reign of emperor daigo ( 897–930 ) , the fujiwara regency was suspended as he ruled directly nevertheless , the fujiwara were not demoted by daigo but actually became stronger during his reign central control of japan had continued to decline , and the fujiwara , along with other great families and religious foundations , acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century despite their usurpation of imperial authority , the fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy family administrations now became public institutions family and state affairs were thoroughly intermixed , a pattern followed among other families , monasteries , and even the imperial family land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy , not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of japan as a single nation under the early courts , when military conscription had been centrally controlled , military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy the re-establishment of an efficient military system was made gradually through a process of trial-and-error bushi interests were diverse , cutting across old power structures to form new associations in the tenth century in time , large regional military families formed around members of the court aristocracy who had become prominent provincial figures the in-no-chō filled the void left by the decline of fujiwara power in time , many of the fujiwara were replaced , mostly by members of the rising minamoto clan in 1159 , the taira and minamoto clashed ( heiji rebellion ) , and a twenty-year period of taira ascendancy began the taira were seduced by court life and ignored problems in the provinces , where the minamoto clan were rebuilding their strength although written chinese ( kanbun ) remained the official language of

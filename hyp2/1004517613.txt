the heian period was preceded by the nara period and began in 794 ce after the movement of the capital of japan to heian-kyō ( modern kyoto ) , by the 50th emperor , emperor kanmu kanmu first tried to move the capital to nagaoka-kyō , but a series of disasters befell the city , prompting the emperor to relocate the capital a second time , to heian the japanese missions to tang china were suspended and the influx of chinese exports halted , a fact which facilitated the independent growth of japanese culture called therefore , the heian period is considered a high point in japanese culture that later generations have always admired the period is also noted for the rise of the samurai class , which would eventually take power and start the feudal period of japan nominally , sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact , power was wielded by the fujiwara nobility the warrior class made steady political gains throughout the heian period still , a true military takeover of the japanese government was centuries away , when much of the strength of the government would lie within the private armies of the shogunate the kamakura period began in 1185 when minamoto no yoritomo seized power from the emperors and established the shogunate in kamakura when emperor kanmu moved the capital to heian-kyō ( kyoto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically the early heian period ( 784–967 ) continued nara culture ; the heian capital was patterned on the china tang capital at chang'an , takei and keane 2001 p kanmu endeavored to improve the tang-style administrative system which was in use despite the decline of the taika–taihō reforms , imperial government was vigorous during the early heian period kanmu 's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles , and he became recognized as one of japan 's most forceful emperors as the soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the emperor 's private office another fujiwara became regent , sesshō for his grandson , then a minor emperor and yet another was appointed kampaku central control of japan had continued to decline , and the fujiwara , along with other great families and religious foundations , acquired ever larger shōen and greater wealth during the early tenth century by the early heian period , the shōen had obtained legal status , and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity , waiver of taxes , and immunity from government inspection of the shōen they held those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to shōen holders in return for a share of the harvest by the year 1000 , fujiwara no michinaga was able to enthrone and dethrone emperors at will little authority was left for traditional institutions , and government affairs were handled through the fujiwara clan 's private administration despite their usurpation of imperial authority , the fujiwara presided over a period of cultural and artistic flowering at the imperial court and among the aristocracy there was great interest in graceful poetry and vernacular literature indigenous art also flourished under the fujiwara after centuries of imitating chinese forms as the most powerful family , the fujiwara governed japan and determined the general affairs of state , such as succession to the throne under the early courts , when military conscription had been centrally controlled , military affairs had been taken out of the hands of the provincial aristocracy at that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of oryoshi , which were appointed to an individual province and tsuibushi , which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks the fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of emperor go-sanjō ( 1068–1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a fujiwara mother since the ninth century he also established an office to compile and validate estate records with the aim of reasserting central control many shōen were not properly certified , and large landholders , like the fujiwara , felt threatened with the loss of their lands the in-no-chō filled the void left by the decline of fujiwara power rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making fujiwara no yorinaga sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1156 against the heir apparent , who was supported by the taira and minamoto ( hōgen rebellion ) the heian period saw the rise of two esoteric buddhist sects , tendai and shingon although written chinese ( kanbun ) remained the official language of the heian period imperial court , the introduction and widespread use of kana saw a boom in japanese literature while on one hand , the heian period was an unusually long period of peace , it can also be argued that the period weakened japan economically and led to poverty for all but a tiny few of its inhabitants the player is able to choose one of the most powerful families of japan at the time , the taira , minamoto or fujiwara ;

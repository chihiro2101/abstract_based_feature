henry david thoreau ( 1817–1862 ) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau 's essay '' civil disobedience '' ( resistance to civil government ) was named as an influence by leo tolstoy , martin buber , mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jr due to its advocacy of nonviolent resistance according to the peace pledge union of britain , it was also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism thoreau himself did not subscribe to pacifism , and did not reject the use of armed revolt 301–316 in the 1840s , the american abolitionist and advocate of nonresistance henry clarke wright and his english follower joseph barker rejected the idea of governments and advocated a form of pacifist individualist anarchism at some point anarcho-pacifism had as its main proponent christian anarchism the tolstoyan movement in russia was the first large-scale anarcho-pacifist movement while many anarchists embraced violent propaganda of the deed during the nineteenth century , anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change tolstoy argued that anarchism must be nonviolent since it is , by definition , opposition to coercion and force , and that since the state is inherently violent , meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic ferdinand domela nieuwenhuis was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement the ligue antimilitariste was to become the french section of the association internationale antimilitariste ( aia ) founded in amsterdam in 1904 '' gandhi 's ideas were popularised in the west in books such as richard gregg 's the power of nonviolence ( 1935 ) , and bart de ligt 's the conquest of violence ( 1937 ) he also linked gandhian principled nonviolence with the pragmatic nonviolent direct action of the syndicalists the american writer dwight macdonald endorsed anarcho-pacifist views in the 1940s and used his journal politics to promote these ideas from the 1940s to the 1960s , then , the radical pacifist movement in the united states harbored both social democrats and anarchists , at a time when the anarchist movement itself seemed on its last legs 21 ( invierno , 2010 ) , 123–131 a leading british anarcho-pacifist was alex comfort who considered himself '' an aggressive anti-militarist , '' and he believed that pacifism rested '' solely upon the historical theory of anarchism 294–303 in the 1950s and 1960s , anarcho-pacifism '' began to gel , tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state , and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence '' '' anarchist faq – a.3.7 are there religious anarchists ? , '' tolstoy 's ideas had a strong influence on gandhi , who inspired his fellow country people to use non-violent resistance to kick britain out of india moreover , gandhi 's vision of a free india as a federation of peasant communes is similar to tolstoy 's anarchist vision of a free society ( although we must stress that gandhi was not an anarchist ) ammon hennacy ( 24 july 1893 & nbsp ; – 14 january 1970 ) was an american pacifist , christian anarchist , vegetarian , social activist , member of the catholic worker movement and a wobbly '' anarchism and the movement for a new society : direct action and prefigurative community in the 1970s and 80s & nbsp ; 62 as long as the state and capitalism exist , violence is inevitable and so , for anarcho-pacifists , the consistent pacifist must be an anarchist just as the consistent anarchist must be a pacifist '' however , the socialist criticism of capitalism that often appear within the movement do not imply that anarcho-pacifism is inherently social anarchist in nature opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even revolutionary action provided it does not result in violence according to gelderloos , pacifism as an ideology serves the interests of the state and is hopelessly caught up psychologically with the control schema of patriarchy and white supremacy

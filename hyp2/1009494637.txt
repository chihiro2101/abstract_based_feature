the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord , with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top production of falsetto , on the other hand , vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold 's body relatively relaxed transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time when the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure , the folds are blown apart , while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition in falsetto , however , the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged ( the singer is singing using the voice ) some speakers and singers leave the cartilaginous portion of the glottis open ( sometimes called 'mutational chink ' ) , and only the front two-thirds of the vocal ligaments enter the vibration one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices while scientific evidence has proven that women have a falsetto register , the issue of 'female falsetto ' has been met with controversy among teachers of singing this controversy does not exist within the sciences and arguments against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current physiological evidence some pioneers in vocal pedagogy , like margaret green and william vennard , were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s , and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto in his 2004 book , solutions for singers : tools for performers and teachers , miller said , '' it is illogical to speak of a female falsetto , because the female is incapable of producing a timbre in the upper range that is radically different from its mezza voce or voce piena in testa qualities '' mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice there is a difference between the modern usage of the '' head voice '' term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto , according to many singing professionals in mexico , one of the famous singers of falsete was miguel aceves mej√≠a , a singer and actor in the golden age of mexican cinema , known as the '' rey de falsete '' , or '' falsetto king '' the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register ; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform classical music for comic effect in both operas and musicals by falsettists , sopranists , male altos or countertenors in tessitura for pitches which are above the range of the modal register for pianissimo tones that would be difficult to execute in the modal register glossary definition of falsetto at virginia tech 's web site story about the falsetto in rock music in the boston globe video : vocal coach kevin richards explains the difference between falsetto and head voice

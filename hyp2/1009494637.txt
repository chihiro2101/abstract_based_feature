the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord , with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top production of falsetto , on the other hand , vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold 's body relatively relaxed transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time in skilled countertenors , however , the mucous membrane of the vocal folds contact with each other completely during each vibration cycle the folds are covered on the surface by larynx mucous membrane which is supported deeper down underneath by the innermost fibres of the thyroarytenoid muscle some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register research has revealed that not all speakers and singers produce falsetto in exactly the same way the mutational chink type of falsetto is considered inefficient and weak , but there is little information available about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the other two types both sexes are physically capable of phonating in the falsetto register one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices while scientific evidence has proven that women have a falsetto register , the issue of 'female falsetto ' has been met with controversy among teachers of singing this controversy does not exist within the sciences and arguments against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current physiological evidence he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos , as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register there is a difference between the modern usage of the '' head voice '' term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto , according to many singing professionals falsetto does not connect to modal voice except at very low volumes , leading to passaggio when transitioning from modal voice the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register ; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform falsetto , however , does involve less physical effort by the singer than the modal voice and , when properly used , can make possible some desirable tonal effects glossary definition of falsetto at virginia tech 's web site story about the falsetto in rock music in the boston globe video : vocal coach kevin richards explains the difference between falsetto and head voice

the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of falsetto , on the other hand , vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold 's body relatively relaxed transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time when the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure , the folds are blown apart , while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition the length or size of the oval orifice or separation between the folds can vary , but it is known to get bigger as the pressure of air pushed out is increased some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register some speakers and singers leave the cartilaginous portion of the glottis open ( sometimes called 'mutational chink ' ) , and only the front two-thirds of the vocal ligaments enter the vibration the resulting sound , which is typical of many adolescents , may be pure and flutelike , but is usually soft and anemic in quality in still others , a phenomenon known as damping appears , with the amount of glottal opening becoming less and less as the pitch rises , until only a tiny slit appears on the highest pitches one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices this controversy does not exist within the sciences and arguments against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current physiological evidence some pioneers in vocal pedagogy , like margaret green and william vennard , were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s , and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos , as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register falsetto is occasionally used by early music specialists today and regularly in british cathedral choirs by men who sing the alto line the type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register ; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform the falsetto voice has a number of highly specialized uses within a musical context glossary definition of falsetto at virginia tech 's web site story about the falsetto in rock music in the boston globe video : vocal coach kevin richards explains the difference between falsetto and head voice

the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord , with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top production of falsetto , on the other hand , vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold 's body relatively relaxed transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time in skilled countertenors , however , the mucous membrane of the vocal folds contact with each other completely during each vibration cycle some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register both sexes are physically capable of phonating in the falsetto register while scientific evidence has proven that women have a falsetto register , the issue of 'female falsetto ' has been met with controversy among teachers of singing this controversy does not exist within the sciences and arguments against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current physiological evidence some pioneers in vocal pedagogy , like margaret green and william vennard , were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s , and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto solutions for singers : tools for performers and teachers ( oxford university press , 2004 ) , page 148 however , other writers of singing have warned about the dangers of failing to recognize that women have a falsetto register mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice he believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos , as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano tessitura using their falsetto register these days , head voice is typically defined as a mix of chest and head voice , therefore created a stronger sound than falsetto although , in contemporary teaching , some teachers no longer talk of the middle voice , choosing to call it the head voice as with men the united states release of muse 's origin of symmetry album was delayed for four years because maverick records wanted the group to rerecord the album with less falsetto in the absence of modern vocal training to hold back the volume of modal voice , in this overlapping area a given pitch in modal voice will be louder than the same pitch sung in falsetto glossary definition of falsetto at virginia tech 's web site story about the falsetto in rock music in the boston globe video : vocal coach kevin richards explains the difference between falsetto and head voice

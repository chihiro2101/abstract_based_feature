the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of falsetto , on the other hand , vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold 's body relatively relaxed transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time when the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure , the folds are blown apart , while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition in falsetto , however , the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged ( the singer is singing using the voice ) the arytenoid cartilages are held in firm apposition in this voice register also some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register some speakers and singers leave the cartilaginous portion of the glottis open ( sometimes called 'mutational chink ' ) , and only the front two-thirds of the vocal ligaments enter the vibration one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices this is due in part to the difference in the length and mass of the vocal folds and to the difference in frequency ranges some pioneers in vocal pedagogy , like margaret green and william vennard , were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s , and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto it can be given classical styling to sound as male classical countertenors make it sound , or be sung in more contemporary musical styles in hawaiian-style falsetto—called '' ka leo ki'eki ' e '' —the singer , usually male , emphasizes the break between registers falsetto does not connect to modal voice except at very low volumes , leading to passaggio when transitioning from modal voice in the absence of modern vocal training to hold back the volume of modal voice , in this overlapping area a given pitch in modal voice will be louder than the same pitch sung in falsetto modal voice is capable of producing much more complex waveforms and infinite varieties of tone color classical music for comic effect in both operas and musicals by falsettists , sopranists , male altos or countertenors in tessitura for pitches which are above the range of the modal register for pianissimo tones that would be difficult to execute in the modal register however , the use of falsetto speech varies by culture and its use has been studied in african americans and gay men in certain contexts

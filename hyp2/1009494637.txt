the modal voice , or modal register , and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord , with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord 's main body , or vocalis muscle , relaxes , enabling the arytenoid cartilage to stretch the vocal ligaments william vennard describes this process as follows : in the modal register , the vocal folds ( when viewed with a stroboscope ) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration , closing the gap between them fully , if just for a very short time in falsetto , however , the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart and in untrained falsetto singers a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged ( the singer is singing using the voice ) the folds are covered on the surface by larynx mucous membrane which is supported deeper down underneath by the innermost fibres of the thyroarytenoid muscle some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register one possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices some pioneers in vocal pedagogy , like margaret green and william vennard , were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s , and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film others refused to accept the idea , and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto in his 2004 book , solutions for singers : tools for performers and teachers , miller said , '' it is illogical to speak of a female falsetto , because the female is incapable of producing a timbre in the upper range that is radically different from its mezza voce or voce piena in testa qualities '' mckinney , who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto , argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice use of falsetto voice in western music is very old the physician , giovanni camillo maffei , in his book discorso della voce e del modo d'apparare di cantar di garganta in 1562 , explained that when a bass singer sang in the soprano range , the voice was called '' falsetto '' in a book by gb mancini , called pensieri e riflessioni written in 1774 , falsetto is equated with '' voce di testa '' ( translated as 'head voice ' ) these days , head voice is typically defined as a mix of chest and head voice , therefore created a stronger sound than falsetto the united states release of muse 's origin of symmetry album was delayed for four years because maverick records wanted the group to rerecord the album with less falsetto falsetto does not connect to modal voice except at very low volumes , leading to passaggio when transitioning from modal voice falsetto , however , does involve less physical effort by the singer than the modal voice and , when properly used , can make possible some desirable tonal effects falsetto also describes the momentary , but often repeated , fluctuations in pitch emitted by both sexes while undergoing voice change during adolescence

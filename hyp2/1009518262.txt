in most industrial countries , the aerospace industry is a cooperation of the public and private sectors along with these public space programs , many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites some known companies involved in space programs include boeing , cobham , airbus , spacex , lockheed martin , united technologies , mda and northrop grumman these companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace , such as the construction of aircraft world war ii inspired wernher von braun to create the v1 and v2 rockets in april 1981 , the space shuttle columbia launched , the start of regular manned access to orbital space a sustained human presence in orbital space started with '' mir '' in 1986 and is continued by the '' international space station '' aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces '' aircraft , guided missiles , space vehicles , aircraft engines , propulsion units , and related parts '' in the united states , the department of defense and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products apprenticeship programs such as the aerospace joint apprenticeship council ( ajac ) work in collaboration with washington state aerospace employers and community colleges to train new manufacturing employees to keep the industry supplied important locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include washington state ( boeing ) , california ( boeing , lockheed martin , etc in the european union , aerospace companies such as eads , bae systems , thales , dassault , saab ab and leonardo s.p.a ( formerly finmeccnica ) account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort , with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products in russia , large aerospace companies like oboronprom and the united aircraft building corporation ( encompassing mikoyan , sukhoi , ilyushin , tupolev , yakovlev , and irkut which includes beriev ) are among the major global players in this industry the historic soviet union was also the home of a major aerospace industry the united kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry , making its own airliners and warplanes , but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies , and it has turned into a large import customer , too , from countries such as the united states in the people 's republic of china , beijing , xi'an , chengdu , shanghai , shenyang and nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry the aircraft parts industry was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector usd in 1996 the acquisition of marconi electronic systems , a subsidiary of gec , by british aerospace for 12.9 bil in this respect , supervisory bodies , such as the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) , european aviation safety agency regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards for example , in the most recent edition of this publication , '' spinoffs 2015 '' , endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement

in most industrial countries , the aerospace industry is a cooperation of the public and private sectors along with these public space programs , many companies produce technical tools and components such as spacecraft and satellites some known companies involved in space programs include boeing , cobham , airbus , spacex , lockheed martin , united technologies , mda and northrop grumman these companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace , such as the construction of aircraft the 19th century saw the creation of the aeronautical society of great britain ( 1866 ) , the american rocketry society , and the institute of aeronautical sciences , all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline it was the preliminary work of cayley , lilienthal , chanute , and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at kitty hawk , north carolina on december 17 , 1903 , by the wright brothers in april 1981 , the space shuttle columbia launched , the start of regular manned access to orbital space space commercialization and space tourism are more recent features of aerospace aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces '' aircraft , guided missiles , space vehicles , aircraft engines , propulsion units , and related parts '' in the united states , the department of defense and the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products apprenticeship programs such as the aerospace joint apprenticeship council ( ajac ) work in collaboration with washington state aerospace employers and community colleges to train new manufacturing employees to keep the industry supplied in the european union , aerospace companies such as eads , bae systems , thales , dassault , saab ab and leonardo s.p.a ( formerly finmeccnica ) account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort , with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products in india , bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry , where hindustan aeronautics limited , the national aerospace laboratories and the indian space research organisation are headquartered in russia , large aerospace companies like oboronprom and the united aircraft building corporation ( encompassing mikoyan , sukhoi , ilyushin , tupolev , yakovlev , and irkut which includes beriev ) are among the major global players in this industry the historic soviet union was also the home of a major aerospace industry in the people 's republic of china , beijing , xi'an , chengdu , shanghai , shenyang and nanchang are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry in the aerospace and defense industry , much consolidation has occurred at the end of the 20th century , going into the 21st century the modern ejection seat was developed during world war ii , a seat on rails ejected by rockets before deploying a parachute , in 1942 , numerical control machining was conceived by machinist john t in this respect , supervisory bodies , such as the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) , european aviation safety agency regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards aerodynamics aeronautics aerospace engineering aircraft astronautics newspace space agencies ( list of ) space exploration spacecraft wiktionary : aviation , aerospace , and aeronautical terms

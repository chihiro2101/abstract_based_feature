the state of some physical systems , and the function e ( s ) to be minimized , is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state at each step , the simulated annealing heuristic considers some neighboring state s of the current state s , and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s or staying in-state s these moves usually result in minimal alterations of the last state , in an attempt to progressively improve the solution through iteratively improving its parts ( such as the city connections in the traveling salesman problem ) to investigate the behavior of simulated annealing on a particular problem , it can be useful to consider the transition probabilities that result from the various design choices made in the implementation of the algorithm for each edge ( s , s ' ) of the search graph , the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state s ' when its current state is s in the formulation of the method by kirkpatrick et al however , this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the function , which is analogous to the proposal distribution in metropolisâ€“hastings , is not symmetric , or not probabilistic at all nevertheless , most descriptions of simulated annealing assume the original acceptance function , which is probably hard-coded in many implementations of sa one that is not based on the probabilistic acceptance rule ) could speed-up the optimization process without impacting on the final quality moscato and fontanari conclude from observing the analogous of the '' specific heat '' curve of the '' threshold updating '' annealing originating from their study that '' the stochasticity of the metropolis updating in the simulated annealing algorithm does not play a major role in the search of near-optimal minima '' instead , they proposed that '' the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of simulated annealing therefore , as a general rule , one should skew the generator towards candidate moves where the energy of the destination state s ' is likely to be similar to that of the current state a more precise statement of the heuristic is that one should try first candidate states s ' for which p ( e ( s ) , e ( s ' ) , t ) is large the physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times dual-phase evolution is a family of algorithms and processes ( to which simulated annealing belongs ) that mediate between local and global search by exploiting phase changes in the search space the runner-root algorithm ( rra ) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for solving unimodal and multimodal problems inspired by the runners and roots of plants in nature simulated annealing a javascript app that allows you to experiment with simulated annealing

the state of some physical systems , and the function e ( s ) to be minimized , is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state the goal is to bring the system , from an arbitrary initial state , to a state with the minimum possible energy at each step , the simulated annealing heuristic considers some neighboring state s of the current state s , and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s or staying in-state s optimization of a solution involves evaluating the neighbours of a state of the problem , which are new states produced through conservatively altering a given state for example , in the travelling salesman problem each state is typically defined as a permutation of the cities to be visited , and the neighbors of any state are the set of permutations produced by swapping any two of these cities the well-defined way in which the states are altered to produce neighboring states is called a '' move '' , and different moves give different sets of neighboring states for each edge ( s , s ' ) of the search graph , the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state s ' when its current state is s however , this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the function , which is analogous to the proposal distribution in metropolisâ€“hastings , is not symmetric , or not probabilistic at all as a result , the transition probabilities of the simulated annealing algorithm do not correspond to the transitions of the analogous physical system , and the long-term distribution of states at a constant temperature t need not bear any resemblance to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution over states of that physical system , at any temperature instead , they proposed that '' the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of simulated annealing when choosing the candidate generator , one must consider that after a few iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm , the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state the physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times in the simulated annealing algorithm , the relaxation time also depends on the candidate generator , in a very complicated way adaptive simulated annealing algorithms address this problem by connecting the cooling schedule to the search progress dual-phase evolution is a family of algorithms and processes ( to which simulated annealing belongs ) that mediate between local and global search by exploiting phase changes in the search space particle swarm optimization is an algorithm modelled on swarm intelligence that finds a solution to an optimization problem in a search space , or model and predict social behavior in the presence of objectives '' general simulated annealing algorithm '' an open-source matlab program for general simulated annealing exercises

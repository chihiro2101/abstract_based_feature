the state of some physical systems , and the function e ( s ) to be minimized , is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state at each step , the simulated annealing heuristic considers some neighboring state s of the current state s , and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s or staying in-state s optimization of a solution involves evaluating the neighbours of a state of the problem , which are new states produced through conservatively altering a given state metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solution space , and although they prefer better neighbours , they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima ; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time to investigate the behavior of simulated annealing on a particular problem , it can be useful to consider the transition probabilities that result from the various design choices made in the implementation of the algorithm for each edge ( s , s ' ) of the search graph , the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state s ' when its current state is s in practice , it 's common to use the same acceptance function for many problems , and adjust the other two functions according to the specific problem nevertheless , most descriptions of simulated annealing assume the original acceptance function , which is probably hard-coded in many implementations of sa when choosing the candidate generator , one must consider that after a few iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm , the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state therefore , as a general rule , one should skew the generator towards candidate moves where the energy of the destination state s ' is likely to be similar to that of the current state in the traveling salesman problem above , for example , swapping two consecutive cities in a low-energy tour is expected to have a modest effect on its energy ( length ) ; whereas swapping two arbitrary cities is far more likely to increase its length than to decrease it the physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times in the simulated annealing algorithm , the relaxation time also depends on the candidate generator , in a very complicated way note that all these parameters are usually provided as black box functions to the simulated annealing algorithm other adaptive approach as thermodynamic simulated annealing , automatically adjusts the temperature at each step based on the energy difference between the two states , according to the laws of thermodynamics particle swarm optimization is an algorithm modelled on swarm intelligence that finds a solution to an optimization problem in a search space , or model and predict social behavior in the presence of objectives '' general simulated annealing algorithm '' an open-source matlab program for general simulated annealing exercises

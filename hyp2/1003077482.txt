the state of some physical systems , and the function e ( s ) to be minimized , is analogous to the internal energy of the system in that state the goal is to bring the system , from an arbitrary initial state , to a state with the minimum possible energy at each step , the simulated annealing heuristic considers some neighboring state s of the current state s , and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s or staying in-state s optimization of a solution involves evaluating the neighbours of a state of the problem , which are new states produced through conservatively altering a given state for example , in the travelling salesman problem each state is typically defined as a permutation of the cities to be visited , and the neighbors of any state are the set of permutations produced by swapping any two of these cities these moves usually result in minimal alterations of the last state , in an attempt to progressively improve the solution through iteratively improving its parts ( such as the city connections in the traveling salesman problem ) the probability of making the transition from the current state s to a candidate new state s_\mathrm 190 edges , and the diameter of the graph is n-1 to investigate the behavior of simulated annealing on a particular problem , it can be useful to consider the transition probabilities that result from the various design choices made in the implementation of the algorithm for each edge ( s , s ' ) of the search graph , the transition probability is defined as the probability that the simulated annealing algorithm will move to state s ' when its current state is s however , this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the function , which is analogous to the proposal distribution in metropolisâ€“hastings , is not symmetric , or not probabilistic at all as a result , the transition probabilities of the simulated annealing algorithm do not correspond to the transitions of the analogous physical system , and the long-term distribution of states at a constant temperature t need not bear any resemblance to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution over states of that physical system , at any temperature instead , they proposed that '' the smoothening of the cost function landscape at high temperature and the gradual definition of the minima during the cooling process are the fundamental ingredients for the success of simulated annealing when choosing the candidate generator , one must consider that after a few iterations of the simulated annealing algorithm , the current state is expected to have much lower energy than a random state therefore , as a general rule , one should skew the generator towards candidate moves where the energy of the destination state s ' is likely to be similar to that of the current state the physical analogy that is used to justify simulated annealing assumes that the cooling rate is low enough for the probability distribution of the current state to be near thermodynamic equilibrium at all times stochastic optimization is an umbrella set of methods that includes simulated annealing and numerous other approaches '' general simulated annealing algorithm '' an open-source matlab program for general simulated annealing exercises

single and multiple scattering when radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center , this is called single scattering it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion , and the terms multiple scattering and diffusion are interchangeable in many contexts the description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to waveâ€“particle duality scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles prosaically , wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object , for instance ( sunlight ) scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow electromagnetic waves are one of the best known and most commonly encountered forms of radiation that undergo scattering major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering along with absorption , such scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere the degree of scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation , along with many other factors including polarization , angle , and coherence electrophoretic light scattering involves passing an electric field through a liquid which makes particles move

single and multiple scattering when radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center , this is called single scattering it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation , the outcome , which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory , appears random to an observer with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion , and the terms multiple scattering and diffusion are interchangeable in many contexts optical elements designed to produce multiple scattering are thus known as diffusers the description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to waveâ€“particle duality scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering rayleigh scattering is a process in which electromagnetic radiation ( including light ) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive indexes , such as a particle , bubble , droplet , or even a density fluctuation both mie and rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes , in which the energy ( and thus wavelength and frequency ) of the light is not substantially changed

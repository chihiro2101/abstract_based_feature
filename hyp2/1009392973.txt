single and multiple scattering when radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center , this is called single scattering it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity not all single scattering is random , however similarly , multiple scattering can sometimes have somewhat random outcomes , particularly with coherent radiation in certain rare circumstances , multiple scattering may only involve a small number of interactions such that the randomness is not completely averaged out the description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to waveâ€“particle duality prosaically , wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object , for instance ( sunlight ) scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering both mie and rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes , in which the energy ( and thus wavelength and frequency ) of the light is not substantially changed for modeling of scattering in cases where the rayleigh and mie models do not apply such as larger , irregularly shaped particles , there are many numerical methods that can be used

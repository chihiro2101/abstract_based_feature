when radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center , this is called single scattering it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion , and the terms multiple scattering and diffusion are interchangeable in many contexts scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles prosaically , wave scattering corresponds to the collision and scattering of a wave with some material object , for instance ( sunlight ) scattered by rain drops to form a rainbow image : electron-scattering.png thumb 220px a feynman diagram of scattering between two electrons by emission of a virtual photon scattering of light and radio waves ( especially in radar ) is particularly important major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering rayleigh scattering is a process in which electromagnetic radiation ( including light ) is scattered by a small spherical volume of variant refractive indexes , such as a particle , bubble , droplet , or even a density fluctuation both mie and rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes , in which the energy ( and thus wavelength and frequency ) of the light is not substantially changed electrophoretic light scattering involves passing an electric field through a liquid which makes particles move

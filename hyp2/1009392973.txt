single and multiple scattering when radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center , this is called single scattering it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion , and the terms multiple scattering and diffusion are interchangeable in many contexts optical elements designed to produce multiple scattering are thus known as diffusers coherent backscattering , an enhancement of backscattering that occurs when coherent radiation is multiply scattered by a random medium , is usually attributed to weak localization not all single scattering is random , however electromagnetic waves are one of the best known and most commonly encountered forms of radiation that undergo scattering major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering along with absorption , such scattering is a major cause of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere both mie and rayleigh scattering are considered elastic scattering processes , in which the energy ( and thus wavelength and frequency ) of the light is not substantially changed

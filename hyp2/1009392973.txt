single and multiple scattering when radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center , this is called single scattering it is very common that scattering centers are grouped together ; in such cases , radiation may scatter many times , in what is known as multiple scattering multiple scattering can thus often be modeled well with diffusion theory because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation , the outcome , which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory , appears random to an observer this type of scattering would be exemplified by an electron being fired at an atomic nucleus with multiple scattering , the randomness of the interaction tends to be averaged out by a large number of scattering events , so that the final path of the radiation appears to be a deterministic distribution of intensity multiple scattering is highly analogous to diffusion , and the terms multiple scattering and diffusion are interchangeable in many contexts the description of scattering and the distinction between single and multiple scattering are tightly related to waveâ€“particle duality scattering theory is a framework for studying and understanding the scattering of waves and particles major forms of elastic light scattering ( involving negligible energy transfer ) are rayleigh scattering and mie theory inelastic scattering includes brillouin scattering , raman scattering , inelastic x-ray scattering and compton scattering however , electromagnetic radiation scattered by moving scattering centers does undergo a doppler shift , which can be detected and used to measure the velocity of the scattering center/s in forms of techniques such as lidar and radar electrophoretic light scattering involves passing an electric field through a liquid which makes particles move

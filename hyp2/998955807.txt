in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle or , in the ( also intrinsic ) axiomatic approach analogous to euclid 's axioms of plane geometry , '' great circle '' is simply an undefined term , together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined '' points '' great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) many statements about the geometry of points and such '' lines '' are equally true in all those geometries provided lines are defined that way , and the theory can be readily extended to higher dimensions nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself if developed as a part of solid geometry , use is made of points , straight lines and planes ( in the euclidean sense ) in the surrounding space in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere the book contains formulae for right-handed triangles , the general law of sines , and the solution of a spherical triangle by means of the polar triangle each point is associated with a unique great circle , called the polar circle of the point , which is the great circle on the plane through the centre of the sphere and perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere through the given point as there are two arcs determined by a pair of points , which are not antipodal , on the great circle they determine , three non-collinear points do not determine a unique triangle since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate , there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere the geometry of the sphere rice university navigation spreadsheets : navigation triangles sphaerica - geometry software for constructing on the sphere

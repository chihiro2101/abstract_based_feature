in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle in the intrinsic approach , a great circle is a geodesic ; a shortest path between any two of its points provided they are close enough great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees spherical geometry is closely related to elliptic geometry an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere concepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the spheroid , though minor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas however , gerolamo cardano noted a century later that much of its material on spherical trigonometry was taken from the twelfth-century work of the andalusi scholar jabir ibn aflah leonhard euler published a series of important memoirs on spherical geometry : l spherical geometry has the following properties : any two great circles intersect in two diametrically opposite points , called antipodal points since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate , there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere the geometry of the sphere rice university navigation spreadsheets : navigation triangles sphaerica - geometry software for constructing on the sphere

in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle in the extrinsic 3-dimensional picture , a great circle is the intersection of the sphere with any plane through the center or , in the ( also intrinsic ) axiomatic approach analogous to euclid 's axioms of plane geometry , '' great circle '' is simply an undefined term , together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined '' points '' this is the same as euclid 's method of treating point and line as undefined primitive notions and axiomatizing their relationships great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself if developed as a part of solid geometry , use is made of points , straight lines and planes ( in the euclidean sense ) in the surrounding space in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees spherical geometry is closely related to elliptic geometry an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere concepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the spheroid , though minor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas spherical geometry has the following properties : any two great circles intersect in two diametrically opposite points , called antipodal points the geometry of the sphere rice university navigation spreadsheets : navigation triangles sphaerica - geometry software for constructing on the sphere

in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle in the extrinsic 3-dimensional picture , a great circle is the intersection of the sphere with any plane through the center or , in the ( also intrinsic ) axiomatic approach analogous to euclid 's axioms of plane geometry , '' great circle '' is simply an undefined term , together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined '' points '' great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) if developed as a part of solid geometry , use is made of points , straight lines and planes ( in the euclidean sense ) in the surrounding space in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees spherical geometry is closely related to elliptic geometry an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere in particular , it is orientability , or one-sided , and unlike the sphere it can not be drawn as a surface in 3-dimensional space without intersecting itself higher-dimensional spherical geometries exist ; see elliptic geometry the book of unknown arcs of a sphere written by the islamic mathematician al-jayyani is considered to be the first treatise on spherical trigonometry leonhard euler published a series of important memoirs on spherical geometry : l since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate , there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere

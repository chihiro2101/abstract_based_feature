in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle in the extrinsic 3-dimensional picture , a great circle is the intersection of the sphere with any plane through the center or , in the ( also intrinsic ) axiomatic approach analogous to euclid 's axioms of plane geometry , '' great circle '' is simply an undefined term , together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined '' points '' great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) many statements about the geometry of points and such '' lines '' are equally true in all those geometries provided lines are defined that way , and the theory can be readily extended to higher dimensions nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself in spherical geometry , angles are defined between great circles , resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects ; for example , the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees spherical geometry is closely related to elliptic geometry an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere concepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the spheroid , though minor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas if '' line '' is taken to mean great circle , spherical geometry obeys two of euclid 's postulates : the second postulate ( '' to produce extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line '' ) and the fourth postulate ( '' that all right angles are equal to one another '' ) since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate , there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere the geometry of the sphere rice university navigation spreadsheets : navigation triangles sphaerica - geometry software for constructing on the sphere

in euclidean geometry , the basic concepts are points and ( straight ) lines in spherical geometry , the basic concepts are point and great circle in the extrinsic 3-dimensional picture , a great circle is the intersection of the sphere with any plane through the center in the intrinsic approach , a great circle is a geodesic ; a shortest path between any two of its points provided they are close enough great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in euclidean geometry , e.g this is more than an analogy ; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry riemannian geometry , where '' lines '' are defined to mean shortest paths ( geodesics ) nevertheless , because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry , and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane , spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term '' line '' at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself if developed as a part of solid geometry , use is made of points , straight lines and planes ( in the euclidean sense ) in the surrounding space spherical geometry is closely related to elliptic geometry an important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane ; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points ( pairs of opposite points ) on the sphere locally , the projective plane has all the properties of spherical geometry , but it has different global properties the book contains formulae for right-handed triangles , the general law of sines , and the solution of a spherical triangle by means of the polar triangle leonhard euler published a series of important memoirs on spherical geometry : l since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate , there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere the geometry of the sphere rice university navigation spreadsheets : navigation triangles sphaerica - geometry software for constructing on the sphere

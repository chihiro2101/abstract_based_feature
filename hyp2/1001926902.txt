maudslay was the fifth of seven children of henry maudslay , a wheelwright in the royal engineers , and margaret ( nee whitaker ) , the young widow of joseph laundy bramah was surprised that he was only eighteen , but maudslay demonstrated his ability and started work at bramah 's workshop in denmark street , st giles maudslay designed and made a set of special tools and machines that allowed the lock to be made at an economic price maudslay came up with the idea of a leather cup washer , which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 , allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time mcfarland this allowed the concept of interchangeable parts ( an idea that was already taking hold ) to be practically applied to nuts and screw when maudslay began working for bramah , the typical lathe was worked by a treadle and the workman held the cutting tool against the work this did not allow for precision , especially in cutting iron , so screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing ( that is , with skilled freehand use of chisels and files ) nuts were rare ; metal screws , when made at all , were usually for use in wood maudslay designed a tool holder into which the cutting tool would be clamped , and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction the slide rest was positioned by a leadscrew to which power was transmitted through a pair of changeable gears so that it traveled in proportion to the turning of the work this allowed screw threads to be precisely cut the ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components and may not have been the first to combine a lead screw , slide rest , and set of change gears all on one lathe ( jesse ramsden may have done that in 1775 ; evidence is scant ) , roe 1916:38 he had trained in shipbuilding at northfleet and , with joshua field , became a partner in his father 's firm , trading as maudslay , sons and field of north lambeth maudslay laid an important foundation for the industrial revolution with his machine tool technology maudslay played his part in the development of mechanical engineering when it was in its infancy , but he was especially pioneering in the development of machine tools to be used in engineering workshops across the world maudslay , great grandson of henry maudslay .

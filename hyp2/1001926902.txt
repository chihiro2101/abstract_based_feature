maudslay was the fifth of seven children of henry maudslay , a wheelwright in the royal engineers , and margaret ( nee whitaker ) , the young widow of joseph laundy his father was wounded in action and so in 1756 became an 'artificer ' at the royal arsenal , woolwich ( then in kent ) , where he remained until 1776 maudslay , henry ( 1771 & ndash ; 1831 ) , dictionary of national biography , vol bell and sons ltd , isbn during his time at the arsenal , maudslay also worked at the royal foundry , where jan verbruggen had installed an innovative horizontal boring machine in 1772 maudslay acquired such a good reputation that joseph bramah called for his services on the recommendation of one of his employees bramah was surprised that he was only eighteen , but maudslay demonstrated his ability and started work at bramah 's workshop in denmark street , st giles bramah designed and patented an improved bramah lock based on the tumbler principle , but had difficulty manufacturing at an economic price maudslay designed and made a set of special tools and machines that allowed the lock to be made at an economic price maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 , allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time when maudslay began working for bramah , the typical lathe was worked by a treadle and the workman held the cutting tool against the work this did not allow for precision , especially in cutting iron , so screw threads were usually made by chipping and filing ( that is , with skilled freehand use of chisels and files ) metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening on the other side were usually fastened in non-threaded ways ( such as clinching or upsetting against a washer ) maudslay designed a tool holder into which the cutting tool would be clamped , and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction the ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components maudslay 's lambeth works began to specialize in the production of marine steam engines maudslay laid an important foundation for the industrial revolution with his machine tool technology the machine , which created uniformity in screws and allowed for the application of interchangeable parts ( a prerequisite for mass production ) , was a revolutionary development necessary for the industrial revolution maudslay 's company was one of the most important british engineering manufactories of the nineteenth century , finally closing in 1904 maudslay , great grandson of henry maudslay .

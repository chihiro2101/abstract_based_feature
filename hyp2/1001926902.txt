maudslay was the fifth of seven children of henry maudslay , a wheelwright in the royal engineers , and margaret ( nee whitaker ) , the young widow of joseph laundy maudslay acquired such a good reputation that joseph bramah called for his services on the recommendation of one of his employees it resisted all efforts for forty-seven years maudslay designed and made a set of special tools and machines that allowed the lock to be made at an economic price bramah had designed a hydraulic press , but was having problems sealing both the piston and the piston rod where it fitted into the cylinder maudslay came up with the idea of a leather cup washer , which gave a perfect seal but offered no resistance to movement when the pressure was released maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 , allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time when maudslay began working for bramah , the typical lathe was worked by a treadle and the workman held the cutting tool against the work maudslay designed a tool holder into which the cutting tool would be clamped , and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction maudslay did not invent the slide rest ( as others such as james nasmyth have claimed ) , roe 1916:36-40 and may not have been the first to combine a lead screw , slide rest , and set of change gears all on one lathe ( jesse ramsden may have done that in 1775 ; evidence is scant ) , roe 1916:38 maudslay also recruited a promising young admiralty draughtsman , joshua field , who proved to be so talented that maudslay took him into partnership maudslay invented the first bench micrometer capable of measuring to one ten-thousandth of an inch ( 0.0001 in ≈ 3 µm ) they introduced some of the earliest screw propulsion units for ships , including one for the first admiralty screw steamship , , in 1841 maudslay laid an important foundation for the industrial revolution with his machine tool technology the machine , which created uniformity in screws and allowed for the application of interchangeable parts ( a prerequisite for mass production ) , was a revolutionary development necessary for the industrial revolution maudslay played his part in the development of mechanical engineering when it was in its infancy , but he was especially pioneering in the development of machine tools to be used in engineering workshops across the world maudslay , great grandson of henry maudslay .

maudslay was the fifth of seven children of henry maudslay , a wheelwright in the royal engineers , and margaret ( nee whitaker ) , the young widow of joseph laundy his father was wounded in action and so in 1756 became an 'artificer ' at the royal arsenal , woolwich ( then in kent ) , where he remained until 1776 maudslay , henry ( 1771 & ndash ; 1831 ) , dictionary of national biography , vol maudslay began work at the age of 12 as a '' powder monkey '' , one of the boys employed in filling cartridges at the arsenal bell and sons ltd , isbn during his time at the arsenal , maudslay also worked at the royal foundry , where jan verbruggen had installed an innovative horizontal boring machine in 1772 maudslay acquired such a good reputation that joseph bramah called for his services on the recommendation of one of his employees bramah designed and patented an improved bramah lock based on the tumbler principle , but had difficulty manufacturing at an economic price maudslay built the lock that was displayed in bramah 's shop window with a notice offering a reward of 200 guineas to anyone who could pick it maudslay designed and made a set of special tools and machines that allowed the lock to be made at an economic price maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 , allowing standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time mcfarland this allowed the concept of interchangeable parts ( an idea that was already taking hold ) to be practically applied to nuts and screw when maudslay began working for bramah , the typical lathe was worked by a treadle and the workman held the cutting tool against the work maudslay designed a tool holder into which the cutting tool would be clamped , and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction and may not have been the first to combine a lead screw , slide rest , and set of change gears all on one lathe ( jesse ramsden may have done that in 1775 ; evidence is scant ) , roe 1916:38 maudslay had shown himself to be so talented that after one year the nineteen-year-old was made manager of bramah 's workshop by 1810 maudslay was employing eighty workers and running out of room at his workshop , so he moved to larger premises in westminster bridge road , lambeth maudslay laid an important foundation for the industrial revolution with his machine tool technology maudslay played his part in the development of mechanical engineering when it was in its infancy , but he was especially pioneering in the development of machine tools to be used in engineering workshops across the world maudslay , great grandson of henry maudslay .

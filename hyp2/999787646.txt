thujone is found in a number of plants , such as thuja ( genus thuja , hence the derivation of the name ) , nootka cypress , some junipers , mugwort , oregano , common sage , tansy , and wormwood , most notably grand wormwood ( artemisia absinthium ) , usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase quantitative 13 cnmr spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene rule used to form thujone in plants are derived from the mep pathway ( mep ) the reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from gpp are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has gpp as its substrate this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) from sabinene ( 8 ) , the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway : sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of ( + ) -sabinol ( 9-1,2 ) by a cytochrome p450 , followed by conversion to ( + ) -sabinone ( 10 ) via a dehydrogenase the isomerism of the ( + ) -sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants ; for instance , in the western redcedar ( thuja plicata ) , thujone is derived exclusively from the ( + ) -trans-sabinol intermediate ( 9-1 ) whereas in the garden sage ( salvia officinalis ) , thujone is formed from the ( + ) -cis-sabinol intermediate ( 9-2 ) modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg other thujone-containing plants such as the tree thuja ( thuja occidentalis ) are used in herbal medicine , mainly for their immune-system stimulating effects gc-ms testing is important in this capacity , because gas chromatography alone may record an inaccurately high reading of thujone as other compounds may interfere with and add to the apparent measured amount 0.5 & nbsp ; mg/kg in food prepared with artemisia species , excluding those prepared with sage and non alcoholic beverages 10 & nbsp ; mg/kg in alcoholic beverages not prepared with artemisia species 25 & nbsp ; mg/kg in food prepared with sage 35 & nbsp ; mg/kg in alcoholic beverages prepared with artemisia species for example , sage and sage oil ( which can be up to 50 % thujone ) are on the food and drug administration 's list of generally recognized as safe ( gras ) substances absinthe offered for sale in the united states must be thujone-free by the same standard that applies to other beverages containing artemisia , so absinthe with small amounts of thujone may be legally imported alberta , ontario , and nova scotia allow 10 & nbsp ; mg/kg thujone ; quebec allows 15 & nbsp ; mg per kg ; manitoba allows 6â€“8 & nbsp ; mg thujone per litre ; british columbia adheres to the same levels as ontario

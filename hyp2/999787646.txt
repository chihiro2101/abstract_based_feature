the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase quantitative 13 cnmr spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene rule used to form thujone in plants are derived from the mep pathway ( mep ) the reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from gpp are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has gpp as its substrate the ion-pair intermediate then cyclizes in an electrophilic addition to yield the α-terpinyl tertiary cation ( 5 ) this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) thujone is a gaba a receptor antagonist and more specifically , a gabaa receptor by inhibiting gaba receptor activation , neurons may fire more easily , which can cause muscle spasms and convulsions thujone is also a 5-ht3 antagonist from 30 to 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , the mice experience muscle spasms in the legs , which progress to general convulsions until death or recovery pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg attention performance has been tested with low and high doses of thujone in alcohol other thujone-containing plants such as the tree thuja ( thuja occidentalis ) are used in herbal medicine , mainly for their immune-system stimulating effects the seizures are caused by the ( + ) -α-thujone interacting with the gaba receptors , causing epileptic activity opinion of the scientific committee on food on thujone scientific committee on food ( 2003 ) retrieved oct 28 , 2006 chemical spectra of α-thujone

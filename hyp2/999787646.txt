thujone is found in a number of plants , such as thuja ( genus thuja , hence the derivation of the name ) , nootka cypress , some junipers , mugwort , oregano , common sage , tansy , and wormwood , most notably grand wormwood ( artemisia absinthium ) , usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase the reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from gpp are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has gpp as its substrate the α-terpinyl cation ( 5 ) then undergoes a 1,2 hydride shift via a wagner-meerwein rearrangement , leading to the formation of the terpinen-4-yl cation ( 6 ) this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) from sabinene ( 8 ) , the proposed biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway : sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of ( + ) -sabinol ( 9-1,2 ) by a cytochrome p450 , followed by conversion to ( + ) -sabinone ( 10 ) via a dehydrogenase the isomerism of the ( + ) -sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants ; for instance , in the western redcedar ( thuja plicata ) , thujone is derived exclusively from the ( + ) -trans-sabinol intermediate ( 9-1 ) whereas in the garden sage ( salvia officinalis ) , thujone is formed from the ( + ) -cis-sabinol intermediate ( 9-2 ) modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety , sleeplessness , and convulsions , which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone in the past , absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone , absinthism : a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact , padosch et al 0.5 & nbsp ; mg/kg in food prepared with artemisia species , excluding those prepared with sage and non alcoholic beverages 10 & nbsp ; mg/kg in alcoholic beverages not prepared with artemisia species 25 & nbsp ; mg/kg in food prepared with sage 35 & nbsp ; mg/kg in alcoholic beverages prepared with artemisia species alberta , ontario , and nova scotia allow 10 & nbsp ; mg/kg thujone ; quebec allows 15 & nbsp ; mg per kg ; manitoba allows 6–8 & nbsp ; mg thujone per litre ; british columbia adheres to the same levels as ontario however , in saskatchewan and quebec , one can purchase any liquor available in the world upon the purchase of a maximum of one case , usually 12 750-ml bottles or 9 & nbsp ; l absinthe absolved , cern courier , july 8 , 2008 thujone.info — databank of peer reviewed articles on thujone , absinthe , absinthism , and independent thujone ratings of some commercial brands

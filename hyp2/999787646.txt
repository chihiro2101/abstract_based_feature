the biosynthesis of thujone is similar to the synthesis of other monoterpenes and begins with the formation of geranyl diphosphate ( gpp ) from dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( dmapp ) and isopentenyl diphosphate ( ipp ) , catalyzed by the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase the reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from gpp are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has gpp as its substrate finally , a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone ( 11-1 ) and β-thujone ( 11-2 ) based on studies that looked only at molecular shape , for many years thujone was thought to act similarly to thc on the cannabinoid receptors ; barnaby conrad iii ; ( 1988 ) thujone is a gaba a receptor antagonist and more specifically , a gabaa receptor modulation of ionotropic gaba receptors by natural products of plant origin the median lethal dose , or ld 50 , of alpha-thujone , the more active of the two isomers , in mice , is around 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , with 0 % mortality rate at 30 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 100 % at 60 & nbsp ; mg/kg pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg attention performance has been tested with low and high doses of thujone in alcohol side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety , sleeplessness , and convulsions , which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone in the past , absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone , absinthism : a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact , padosch et al gc-ms testing is important in this capacity , because gas chromatography alone may record an inaccurately high reading of thujone as other compounds may interfere with and add to the apparent measured amount based on this , absinthe , which contains a small amount of wormwood oil , was assumed to be more dangerous than ordinary alcohol the seizures are caused by the ( + ) -α-thujone interacting with the gaba receptors , causing epileptic activity absinthe offered for sale in the united states must be thujone-free by the same standard that applies to other beverages containing artemisia , so absinthe with small amounts of thujone may be legally imported absinthe absolved , cern courier , july 8 , 2008 thujone.info — databank of peer reviewed articles on thujone , absinthe , absinthism , and independent thujone ratings of some commercial brands

it is also found in various species of mentha ( mint ) quantitative 13 cnmr spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene rule used to form thujone in plants are derived from the mep pathway ( mep ) the reactions that generate the thujane skeleton in sabinene from gpp are mediated by the enzyme sabinene synthase which has gpp as its substrate this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) finally , a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone ( 11-1 ) and β-thujone ( 11-2 ) by inhibiting gaba receptor activation , neurons may fire more easily , which can cause muscle spasms and convulsions from 30 to 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , the mice experience muscle spasms in the legs , which progress to general convulsions until death or recovery pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg attention performance has been tested with low and high doses of thujone in alcohol side effects from the essential oil of this plant include anxiety , sleeplessness , and convulsions , which confirms the central nervous system effects of thujone in the past , absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone , absinthism : a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact , padosch et al valentin_magnan , who studied alcoholism , tested pure wormwood oil on animals and discovered it caused seizures independent from the effects of alcohol the studies described above were conducted and found only minute levels of thujone in absinthe piołunówka – polish alcoholic preparation with thujone content higher than in absinthe the shaky history of thujone – wormwood society article on thujone and its history .

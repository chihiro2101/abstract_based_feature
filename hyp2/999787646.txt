it is also found in various species of mentha ( mint ) quantitative 13 cnmr spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that the isoprene rule used to form thujone in plants are derived from the mep pathway ( mep ) the ion-pair intermediate then cyclizes in an electrophilic addition to yield the α-terpinyl tertiary cation ( 5 ) this cation undergoes a second cyclization to form the thujyl cation intermediate ( 7 ) before loss of a proton to form the thujone precursor , sabinene ( 8 ) finally , a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone ( 11-1 ) and β-thujone ( 11-2 ) thujone is a gaba a receptor antagonist and more specifically , a gabaa receptor by inhibiting gaba receptor activation , neurons may fire more easily , which can cause muscle spasms and convulsions thujone is also a 5-ht3 antagonist from 30 to 45 & nbsp ; mg/kg , the mice experience muscle spasms in the legs , which progress to general convulsions until death or recovery pretreatment with gaba positive allosteric modulators like diazepam , phenobarbital , or 1 g/kg of ethanol protects against a lethal dose of 100 & nbsp ; mg/kg in the past , absinthe was thought to contain up to 260–350 & nbsp ; mg/l thujone , absinthism : a fictitious 19th-century syndrome with present impact , padosch et al the seizures are caused by the ( + ) -α-thujone interacting with the gaba receptors , causing epileptic activity the studies described above were conducted and found only minute levels of thujone in absinthe maximum thujone levels in the eu are : regulation ( ec ) no 1334/2008 of the european parliament and council of 16 december 2008 , european commission the shaky history of thujone – wormwood society article on thujone and its history .

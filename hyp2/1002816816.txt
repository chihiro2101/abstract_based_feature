mf waves can also travel longer distances via skywave propagation , in which radio waves radiated at an angle into the sky are refracted back to earth by layers of charged particles ( ions ) in the ionosphere , the e and f layers however , at certain times the d layer ( at a lower altitude than the refractive e and f layers ) can be electronically noisy and absorb mf radio waves , interfering with skywave propagation on nights of good skywave propagation , the signals of distant stations may reflect off the ionosphere and interfere with the signals of local stations on the same frequency a major use of these frequencies is am broadcasting ; am radio stations are allocated frequencies in the medium wave broadcast band from 526.5 & nbsp ; khz to 1606.5 & nbsp ; khz in europe ; in north america this extends from 525 & nbsp ; khz to 1705 & nbsp ; khz some countries also allow broadcasting in the 120-meter band from 2300 to 2495 & nbsp ; khz ; these frequencies are mostly used in tropical areas these include , as examples , the french mrcc on 1696 & nbsp ; khz and 2677 & nbsp ; khz , stornoway coastguard on 1743 & nbsp ; khz , the us coastguard on 2670 & nbsp ; khz and madeira on 2843 & nbsp ; khz non-directional beacon ( ndbs ) for maritime and aircraft navigation occupy a band from 190 to 435 & nbsp ; khz , which overlaps from the lf into the bottom part of the mf band 500 khz was for many years the maritime international distress frequency , and there are more ndbs between 510 and 530 & nbsp ; khz navtex , which is part of the current global maritime distress safety system occupies 518 & nbsp ; khz and 490 & nbsp ; khz for important digital text broadcasts government frequency allocation chart an amateur radio band known as 160 meters or 'top-band ' is between 1800 and 2000 & nbsp ; khz ( allocation depends on country and starts at 1810 & nbsp ; khz outside the americas ) commercial radio stations use a ground system consisting of many heavy copper cables , buried a few feet in the earth , radiating from the base of the antenna to a distance of about a quarter wavelength

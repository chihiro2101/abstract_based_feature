radio waves at mf wavelengths propagate via ground waves and reflection from the ionosphere ( called skywaves ) typical mf radio stations can cover a radius of several hundred miles from the transmitter , with longer distances over water and damp earth mf waves can also travel longer distances via skywave propagation , in which radio waves radiated at an angle into the sky are refracted back to earth by layers of charged particles ( ions ) in the ionosphere , the e and f layers however , at certain times the d layer ( at a lower altitude than the refractive e and f layers ) can be electronically noisy and absorb mf radio waves , interfering with skywave propagation a major use of these frequencies is am broadcasting ; am radio stations are allocated frequencies in the medium wave broadcast band from 526.5 & nbsp ; khz to 1606.5 & nbsp ; khz in europe ; in north america this extends from 525 & nbsp ; khz to 1705 & nbsp ; khz some countries also allow broadcasting in the 120-meter band from 2300 to 2495 & nbsp ; khz ; these frequencies are mostly used in tropical areas these include , as examples , the french mrcc on 1696 & nbsp ; khz and 2677 & nbsp ; khz , stornoway coastguard on 1743 & nbsp ; khz , the us coastguard on 2670 & nbsp ; khz and madeira on 2843 & nbsp ; khz non-directional beacon ( ndbs ) for maritime and aircraft navigation occupy a band from 190 to 435 & nbsp ; khz , which overlaps from the lf into the bottom part of the mf band navtex , which is part of the current global maritime distress safety system occupies 518 & nbsp ; khz and 490 & nbsp ; khz for important digital text broadcasts lastly , there are aeronautical and other mobile ssb bands from 2850 & nbsp ; khz to 3500 & nbsp ; khz , crossing the boundary from the mf band into the hf radio band many home-portable or cordless telephones , especially those that were designed in the 1980s , transmit low power fm audio signals between the table-top base unit and the handset on frequencies in the range 1600 to 1800 & nbsp ; khz

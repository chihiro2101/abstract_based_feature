psychologist dorothy tennov coined the term '' limerence '' for her 1979 book , love and limerence : the experience of being in love , to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s , when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love limerence , which is not exclusively sexual , has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and relation to attachment theory it has been described as being '' an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object ( lo ) involving intrusive and obsessive thoughts , feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair , contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation '' attachment theory emphasizes that '' many of the most intense emotions arise during the formation , the maintenance , the disruption , and the renewal of attachment relationships '' it has been suggested that '' the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation '' during attachment formation , '' a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation '' during the '' intensive for tennov , '' sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence willmott and bentley define limerence as an acute onset , unexpected , obsessive attachment to one person ( the limerent object ) however , in common speech , infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information , and is usually short-lived she notes that one form may evolve into the other : '' those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say 'we were very much in love when we married ; today we love each other very much ' '' nicky hayes describes limerence as '' a kind of infatuated , all-absorbing passion '' which is unrequited limerence is characterized by intrusive thought and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual it can be experienced as intense joy or as extreme despair , depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that love involves concern for the other person 's welfare and feeling physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence , unlike with one experiencing sexual attraction limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object in cases of unrequited limerence , transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object a limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act , thought , or condition that can be interpreted favorably this may include a tendency to devise , fabricate , or invent '' reasonable '' explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object in their thoughts , such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes during the height of limerence , thoughts of the limerent object ( or person ) are at once persistent , involuntary and intrusive appear to be genetically driven '' : indeed , limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession if a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object , immediately one is made a limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual , often tragic , event the bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible ( though they often represent grave departures from the probable ) dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities , and devotion to them , there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated : rejection considerable self-doubt is encountered , leading to '' personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person '' , something which causes misery and galvanizes desire although it appears that limerence advances with adversity , personal discomfort may foul it limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty the inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and subtleties of behavior for evidence of limerent hope in such cases , limerence may form as a defense mechanism against the limerent object , who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal , but as a physical threat to the limerent once the limerent reaction has initiated , one of three varieties of bonds may form , defined over a set duration of time , in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence , physical , or in the form of an actual relationship ) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings , starvation , described by tennov as '' the onslaught of evidence that lo does not return the limerence '' ) causes the limerent to gradually desensitize

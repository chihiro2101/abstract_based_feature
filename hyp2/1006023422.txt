during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including vesto slipher , milton humason , and nicholas mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei in 1943 , carl seyfert published a paper in which he described observations of nearby galaxies having bright nuclei that were sources of unusually broad emission lines active galaxies such as these are known as seyfert galaxy in honor of seyfert 's pioneering work in photographic images , some of these objects were nearly point-like or quasi-stellar in appearance , and were classified as quasar ( later abbreviated as '' quasars '' ) from this point forward active galactic nuclei ( agn ) became a key component in theories of galactic evolution the enormous luminosities of these quasars as well as their unusual spectral properties indicated that their power source could not be ordinary stars in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks in the standard model of agn , cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines a large fraction of the agn 's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc , but ( in a steady-state situation ) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband , most likely the infrared in this type of accretion , which is important for accretion rates well below the eddington limit , the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole radiatively inefficient agn would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard agn with an accretion disc jets can also contribute to this component of the agn emission as it is thermal emission , it can be distinguished from any jet or disc-related emission the lines are broad because the emitting material is revolving around the black hole with high speeds causing a range of doppler shifts of the emitted photons in some radio-quiet agn there is an excess of soft x-ray emission in addition to the power-law component this is a result of illumination of cold heavy elements by the x-ray continuum that causes fluorescence of x-ray emission lines , the best-known of which is the iron feature around 6.4 kev this line may be narrow or broad : broad iron k line can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole it is debatable whether all such systems are true agn ( powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole ) some may be radio-quiet analogues of the low-excitation radio galaxies ( see below ) they show optical range nuclear continuum emission , narrow and occasionally broad emission lines , occasionally strong nuclear x-ray emission and sometimes a weak small-scale radio jet they always show strong optical continuum emission , x-ray continuum emission , and broad and narrow optical emission lines some astronomers use the term qso ( quasi-stellar object ) for this class of agn , reserving 'quasar ' for radio-loud objects , while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars thus they show strong optical continuum emission , broad and narrow emission lines , and strong x-ray emission , together with nuclear and often extended radio emission low-excitation objects show no strong narrow or broad emission lines , and the emission lines they do have may be excited by a different mechanism in seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum , broad-line region or ( soft ) x-ray emission if they do not have the scattering component of seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard x-ray emission some torus models predict how seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the torus covering factor , something supported by studies in the x-ray of agn for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity

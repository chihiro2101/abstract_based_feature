during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon in 1943 , carl seyfert published a paper in which he described observations of nearby galaxies having bright nuclei that were sources of unusually broad emission lines active galaxies such as these are known as seyfert galaxy in honor of seyfert 's pioneering work some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active elliptical galaxy such as messier 87 and centaurus a the 3c radio survey led to further progress in discovery of new radio sources as well as identifying the visible light sources associated with the radio emission at the solvay conference on physics in 1958 , ambartsumian presented a report arguing that '' explosions in galactic nuclei cause large amounts of mass to be expelled from this point forward active galactic nuclei ( agn ) became a key component in theories of galactic evolution schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks agn research encompasses observational surveys to find agn over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift , examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes , studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of electromagnetic radiation from agn , examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from agn , and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on galaxy evolution for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation , and a massive black hole has a high eddington luminosity , and as a result , it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge ( the m–sigma relation ) or with bulge luminosity in the standard model of agn , cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc dissipative processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards , while causing the accretion disc to heat up the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines a large fraction of the agn 's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc , but ( in a steady-state situation ) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband , most likely the infrared however , they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the compton scattering process , and so agn jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation radiatively inefficient agn would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard agn with an accretion disc agn are a candidate source of high and ultra-high energy cosmic rays ( see also centrifugal mechanism of acceleration ) jets can also contribute to this component of the agn emission this line may be narrow or broad : broad iron k line can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole it is debatable whether all such systems are true agn ( powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole ) originally they were divided into two types known as seyfert 1 and 2 : seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while seyfert 2s do not , and seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy x-ray emission they always show strong optical continuum emission , x-ray continuum emission , and broad and narrow optical emission lines some astronomers use the term qso ( quasi-stellar object ) for this class of agn , reserving 'quasar ' for radio-loud objects , while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars by analogy with seyfert 2s , these are objects with quasar-like luminosities but without strong optical nuclear continuum emission or broad line emission these do not show strong nuclear emission lines—broad or narrow—they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related , and their x-ray emission is also consistent with coming purely from a jet , with no heavily absorbed nuclear component in general some torus models predict how seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the torus covering factor , something supported by studies in the x-ray of agn for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity

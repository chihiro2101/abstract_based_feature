during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including vesto slipher , milton humason , and nicholas mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei in 1943 , carl seyfert published a paper in which he described observations of nearby galaxies having bright nuclei that were sources of unusually broad emission lines active galaxies such as these are known as seyfert galaxy in honor of seyfert 's pioneering work some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active elliptical galaxy such as messier 87 and centaurus a another radio source , cygnus a , was identified by walter baade and rudolph minkowski as a tidally distorted galaxy with an unusual spectral line spectrum , having a recessional velocity of 16,700 kilometers per second the 3c radio survey led to further progress in discovery of new radio sources as well as identifying the visible light sources associated with the radio emission schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified shortly afterward , optical spectra were used to measure the redshifts of a growing number of quasars including 3c 48 , even more distant at redshift 0.37 accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole was suggested as the source of quasars ' power in papers by edwin salpeter and yakov zeldovich in 1964 in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole in the standard model of agn , cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines a large fraction of the agn 's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc , but ( in a steady-state situation ) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband , most likely the infrared these come from cold material close to the central black hole this is a result of illumination of cold heavy elements by the x-ray continuum that causes fluorescence of x-ray emission lines , the best-known of which is the iron feature around 6.4 kev this line may be narrow or broad : broad iron k line can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole as the name suggests , these systems show only weak nuclear emission-line regions , and no other signatures of agn emission it is debatable whether all such systems are true agn ( powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole ) originally they were divided into two types known as seyfert 1 and 2 : seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while seyfert 2s do not , and seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy x-ray emission they always show strong optical continuum emission , x-ray continuum emission , and broad and narrow optical emission lines radio-loud quasars behave exactly like radio-quiet quasars with the addition of emission from a jet the currently favoured unified models are 'orientation-based unified models ' meaning that they propose that the apparent differences between different types of objects arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer the two classes of populations appear to differ by their luminosity , where the seyfert 2s without a hidden broad-line region are generally less luminous studying neighbour galaxies rather than the agn themselves first suggested the numbers of neighbours were larger for seyfert 2s than for seyfert 1s , in contradiction with the unified model the agn environment studies are in line with evolution-based unification models where seyfert 2s transform into seyfert 1s during merger , supporting earlier models of merger-driven activation of seyfert 1 nuclei for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity the evolution of the low-luminosity agn population is much less well understood due to the difficulty of observing these objects at high redshifts

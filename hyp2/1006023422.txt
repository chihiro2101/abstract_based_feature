during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including vesto slipher , milton humason , and nicholas mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei in 1943 , carl seyfert published a paper in which he described observations of nearby galaxies having bright nuclei that were sources of unusually broad emission lines active galaxies such as these are known as seyfert galaxy in honor of seyfert 's pioneering work for these explosions to occur , galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation , and a massive black hole has a high eddington luminosity , and as a result , it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole in the standard model of agn , cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines a large fraction of the agn 's radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc , but ( in a steady-state situation ) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband , most likely the infrared the direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole however , they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the compton scattering process , and so agn jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation in this type of accretion , which is important for accretion rates well below the eddington limit , the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole radiatively inefficient agn would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard agn with an accretion disc there is no single observational signature of an agn this is visible whenever the accretion disc and its environment are obscured by gas and dust close to the nucleus and then re-emitted ( 'reprocessing ' ) these come from cold material close to the central black hole this line may be narrow or broad : broad iron k line can be used to study the dynamics of the accretion disc very close to the nucleus and therefore the nature of the central black hole radio-quiet objects are simpler since jet and any jet-related emission can be neglected at all wavelengths originally they were divided into two types known as seyfert 1 and 2 : seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while seyfert 2s do not , and seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy x-ray emission various forms of elaboration on this scheme exist : for example , seyfert 1s with relatively narrow broad lines are sometimes referred to as narrow-line seyfert 1s they always show strong optical continuum emission , x-ray continuum emission , and broad and narrow optical emission lines some astronomers use the term qso ( quasi-stellar object ) for this class of agn , reserving 'quasar ' for radio-loud objects , while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars by analogy with seyfert 2s , these are objects with quasar-like luminosities but without strong optical nuclear continuum emission or broad line emission “ blazars ” ( bl lac objects and ovv quasars ) classes are distinguished by rapidly variable , polarized optical , radio and x-ray emission in seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum , broad-line region or ( soft ) x-ray emission some torus models predict how seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the torus covering factor , something supported by studies in the x-ray of agn for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity

during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including vesto slipher , milton humason , and nicholas mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei in 1943 , carl seyfert published a paper in which he described observations of nearby galaxies having bright nuclei that were sources of unusually broad emission lines active galaxies such as these are known as seyfert galaxy in honor of seyfert 's pioneering work some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active elliptical galaxy such as messier 87 and centaurus a the 3c radio survey led to further progress in discovery of new radio sources as well as identifying the visible light sources associated with the radio emission soviet armenian astrophysicist viktor ambartsumian introduced active galactic nuclei in the early 1950s at the solvay conference on physics in 1958 , ambartsumian presented a report arguing that '' explosions in galactic nuclei cause large amounts of mass to be expelled for these explosions to occur , galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature from this point forward active galactic nuclei ( agn ) became a key component in theories of galactic evolution accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole was suggested as the source of quasars ' power in papers by edwin salpeter and yakov zeldovich in 1964 in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) agn are both compact and persistently extremely luminous accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation , and a massive black hole has a high eddington luminosity , and as a result , it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge ( the mâ€“sigma relation ) or with bulge luminosity thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole in the standard model of agn , cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines some accretion discs produce jets of twin , highly collimated , and fast outflows that emerge in opposite directions from close to the disc the direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole the jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband , where very-long-baseline interferometry can be used to study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-parsec scales radiatively inefficient agn would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard agn with an accretion disc as the name suggests , these systems show only weak nuclear emission-line regions , and no other signatures of agn emission they show optical range nuclear continuum emission , narrow and occasionally broad emission lines , occasionally strong nuclear x-ray emission and sometimes a weak small-scale radio jet quasars were originally 'quasi-stellar ' in optical images as they had optical luminosities that were greater than that of their host galaxy there is a correlation between the quasar 's luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy , in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies ( ellipticals ) in both classes of source , the variable emission is believed to originate in a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight therefore , one can not know whether the gas in all seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single , non-stellar continuum source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity the evolution of the low-luminosity agn population is much less well understood due to the difficulty of observing these objects at high redshifts

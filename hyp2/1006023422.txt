during the first half of the 20th century , photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of agn emission , although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the agn phenomenon further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including vesto slipher , milton humason , and nicholas mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei active galaxies such as these are known as seyfert galaxy in honor of seyfert 's pioneering work the development of radio astronomy was a major catalyst to understanding agn some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active elliptical galaxy such as messier 87 and centaurus a soviet armenian astrophysicist viktor ambartsumian introduced active galactic nuclei in the early 1950s for these explosions to occur , galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature from this point forward active galactic nuclei ( agn ) became a key component in theories of galactic evolution schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic ( outside the milky way , at a cosmological distance ) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified shortly afterward , optical spectra were used to measure the redshifts of a growing number of quasars including 3c 48 , even more distant at redshift 0.37 accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole was suggested as the source of quasars ' power in papers by edwin salpeter and yakov zeldovich in 1964 in 1969 donald lynden-bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of '' dead '' quasars , and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby seyfert galaxies in the 1960s and 1970s , early x-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of x-ray emission , which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks for a long time it has been argued that an agn must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes ( 10 6 to 10 10 times the solar mass ) accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation , and a massive black hole has a high eddington luminosity , and as a result , it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity thus agn-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole in the standard model of agn , cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc dissipative processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards , while causing the accretion disc to heat up the expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband ; in addition , a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can compton scattering photons up to x-ray energies the radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines the direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole the jet production mechanism and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low however , they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the compton scattering process , and so agn jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation in this type of accretion , which is important for accretion rates well below the eddington limit , the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong agn-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters , where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities agn are a candidate source of high and ultra-high energy cosmic rays ( see also centrifugal mechanism of acceleration ) there is no single observational signature of an agn these emission contributions dominate the luminosity of the agn at radio wavelengths and possibly at some or all other wavelengths it is debatable whether all such systems are true agn ( powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole ) unified models propose that different observational classes of agn are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions while controversy about the soundness of each individual study still prevails , they all agree on that the simplest viewing-angle based models of agn unification are incomplete for a long time , active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum , because of their high luminosity

the video toaster was designed by newtek founder tim jenison in topeka , kansas one feature of the video toaster is the inclusion of lightwave 3d , a 3d modeling , rendering , and animation program these effects are in large part performed with the help of the native amiga graphics chipset , which is synchronized to the ntsc video signals the toaster hardware requires very stable input signals , and therefore is often used along with a separate video sync time-base corrector to stabilize the video sources as with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create dves ( digital video effects ) , the video path through the toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in '' digital '' mode the frame delays passing through the toaster and other low-cost video switchers make precise editing a frustrating endeavor a non-linear editing system ( nle ) product was added later , with the invention of the video toaster flyer although initially offered as just an add-on to an amiga , the video toaster was soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the toaster , amiga , and sync generator the toaster was also the first such video device designed around a general-purpose personal computer that is capable of delivering broadcast-quality ntsc signals as such , during the early 1990s the toaster was widely used by consumer amiga owners , desktop video enthusiasts , and local television studios , and was even used during the tonight show regularly to produce special effects for comedy skits the nbc also used the video toaster with lightwave for its promotional campaigns , beginning with the 1990-1991 broadcast season ( '' nbc : the place to be ! '' ) an updated version called video toaster 4000 was later released , using the amiga 4000 's video slot the screamer accelerated the rendering of animations developed using the toaster 's bundled lightwave 3d software , and is supposedly 40 times as powerful as a toaster 4000 with the additions of packages such as discreetfx 's millennium and thousands of wipes and backgrounds added over the years , one can still find the video toaster system in use today in fully professional systems by 2009 , the video toaster started to receive less attention from newtek in the run-up to the transition to hd systems in december 2010 , the discontinuation of vt5 was announced , marking the end of the video toaster as a stand-alone product

the video toaster was designed by newtek founder tim jenison in topeka , kansas the toaster was announced at the world of commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in december 1990 for the commodore amiga 2000 computer system , taking advantage of the video-friendly aspects of that system 's hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of 2,399 the hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the amiga 2000 's unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots , and therefore can not be used with the a500 or a1000 models the card has several bnc connectors in the rear , which accepts four video input sources and provided two outputs ( preview and program ) one feature of the video toaster is the inclusion of lightwave 3d , a 3d modeling , rendering , and animation program the toaster hardware requires very stable input signals , and therefore is often used along with a separate video sync time-base corrector to stabilize the video sources as with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create dves ( digital video effects ) , the video path through the toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in '' digital '' mode the frame delays passing through the toaster and other low-cost video switchers make precise editing a frustrating endeavor a non-linear editing system ( nle ) product was added later , with the invention of the video toaster flyer although initially offered as just an add-on to an amiga , the video toaster was soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the toaster , amiga , and sync generator these toaster systems became very popular , primarily because at a cost of around us 5,000 , they could do much of what a 100,000 fully professional video switcher ( such as an evans & sutherland ) could do at that time the toaster was also the first such video device designed around a general-purpose personal computer that is capable of delivering broadcast-quality ntsc signals an updated version called video toaster 4000 was later released , using the amiga 4000 's video slot the amiga video toaster 4000 source code was released in 2004 by newtek & discreetfx with the additions of packages such as discreetfx 's millennium and thousands of wipes and backgrounds added over the years , one can still find the video toaster system in use today in fully professional systems in december 2010 , the discontinuation of vt5 was announced , marking the end of the video toaster as a stand-alone product

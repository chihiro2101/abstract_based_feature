the video toaster was designed by newtek founder tim jenison in topeka , kansas the toaster was announced at the world of commodore expo in 1987 and released as a commercial product in december 1990 for the commodore amiga 2000 computer system , taking advantage of the video-friendly aspects of that system 's hardware to deliver the product at an unusually low cost of 2,399 the hardware component is a full-sized card that is installed into the amiga 2000 's unique single video expansion slot rather than the standard bus slots , and therefore can not be used with the a500 or a1000 models one feature of the video toaster is the inclusion of lightwave 3d , a 3d modeling , rendering , and animation program aside from simple fades , dissolves , and cuts , the video toaster has a large variety of character generation , overlays and complex animated switching effects the toaster hardware requires very stable input signals , and therefore is often used along with a separate video sync time-base corrector to stabilize the video sources as with all video switchers that use a frame buffer to create dves ( digital video effects ) , the video path through the toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in '' digital '' mode a user still needs at least three video tape recorders ( vtr ) and a controller to perform b-roll linear video editing ( le ) , as the toaster serves merely as a switcher , which can be triggered through general-purpose input/output ( gpio ) to switch on cue in such a configuration , as the toaster has no edit-controlling capabilities a non-linear editing system ( nle ) product was added later , with the invention of the video toaster flyer although initially offered as just an add-on to an amiga , the video toaster was soon available as a complete turn-key system that included the toaster , amiga , and sync generator these toaster systems became very popular , primarily because at a cost of around us 5,000 , they could do much of what a 100,000 fully professional video switcher ( such as an evans & sutherland ) could do at that time the toaster was also the first such video device designed around a general-purpose personal computer that is capable of delivering broadcast-quality ntsc signals the nbc also used the video toaster with lightwave for its promotional campaigns , beginning with the 1990-1991 broadcast season ( '' nbc : the place to be ! '' ) an updated version called video toaster 4000 was later released , using the amiga 4000 's video slot in 2004 , the source code for the amiga version was publicly released and hosted on discreetfx 's site open video toaster dollars worth of conventional 3d virtual set equipment alone , and is also found in newtek 's venerable vt5 integrated production suite , the modern-day successor to the original video toaster

image : moog modular 55 img2.jpg thumb a moog 55 ( c 1981 ) the first modular synthesizer was developed by german engineer harald bode in the late 1950s the moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds , such as envelopes , noise generator , filters , and sequencers , pinch , trevor ; trocco , frank ( 2004 ) analog days : the invention and impact of the moog synthesizer by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers german engineer dieter doepfer believed modular synthesizers could still be useful for creating unique sounds , and created the a new , smaller modular system , the doepfer a-100 this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules the basic modular functions are : signal , control , logic/timing ) there exist many different types of modules modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity common types of noise offered by modular synthesizers include white , pink , and low frequency noise lfo - a low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled it is generally used as a control voltage for another module the rectangular wave can be used as a logic / timing / trigger function often configured as adsr ( attack , decay , sustain , release ) it provides a transient voltage that rises and falls it can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger in the presence of a gate sequencer , also sometimes called an analog step sequencer , is a family of compound module types which may be a source or a processor , see also below the sequencer may also output a trigger , and/or gate , at each step ( stage ) when used in a control voltage path to an oscillator , this can be used to create glide or portamento between frequencies many early synthesizer modules had modules with height in integer inches : 11 '' ( e.g the “ modules ” are typically not separable and may physically be parts of a contiguous circuit board the different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration , but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords modular analog synthesizers return ! article about new modular systems

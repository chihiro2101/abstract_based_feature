image : moog modular 55 img2.jpg thumb a moog 55 ( c 1981 ) the first modular synthesizer was developed by german engineer harald bode in the late 1950s the 1960s saw the introduction of the moog synthesizer and the buchla electronic musical instruments , created around the same period the moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds , such as envelopes , noise generator , filters , and sequencers , pinch , trevor ; trocco , frank ( 2004 ) connected by patch cable by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules the basic modular functions are : signal , control , logic/timing ) there exist many different types of modules modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity modules can usually be categorized as either sources or processors austin , kevin '' econtact ! 17.4 & nbsp ; Â‹ analogue and modular synthesis : resurgence and evolution ( february 2016 ) common types of noise offered by modular synthesizers include white , pink , and low frequency noise lfo - a low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled it may be operated with a period anywhere from a fortieth of a second to several minutes it is generally used as a control voltage for another module a trigger in the presence of a gate , applied to an envelope generator produces a single , shaped voltage sequencer , also sometimes called an analog step sequencer , is a family of compound module types which may be a source or a processor , see also below most vcfs have variable resonance , sometimes voltage-controlled rm - ring modulator - two audio inputs are utilized to create sum and difference frequencies while suppressing the original signals there are also software synthesizers for personal computers which are organized as interconnectable modules the different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration , but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords modular analog synthesizers return ! article about new modular systems

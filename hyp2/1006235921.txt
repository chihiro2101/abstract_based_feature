image : moog modular 55 img2.jpg thumb a moog 55 ( c 1981 ) the first modular synthesizer was developed by german engineer harald bode in the late 1950s the 1960s saw the introduction of the moog synthesizer and the buchla electronic musical instruments , created around the same period the moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds , such as envelopes , noise generator , filters , and sequencers , pinch , trevor ; trocco , frank ( 2004 ) analog days : the invention and impact of the moog synthesizer the japanese company roland released the roland system 100 in 1975 , followed by the system 700 in 1976 and the system 100m in 1979 by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers german engineer dieter doepfer believed modular synthesizers could still be useful for creating unique sounds , and created the a new , smaller modular system , the doepfer a-100 this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules the basic modular functions are : signal , control , logic/timing modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity in the late 1970s , modular synthesizers started to be largely supplanted in pop music by highly integrated keyboard synthesizers , racks of midi-connected gear , and samplers noise source - a source that outputs a random voltage lfo - a low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled it can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger in the presence of a gate sequencer , also sometimes called an analog step sequencer , is a family of compound module types which may be a source or a processor , see also below vca - voltage-controlled amplifier , is usually a unity-gain amplifier which varies the amplitude of a signal in response to an applied control voltage custom control inputs - it is possible to connect any kind of voltage to a modular synthesizer as long as it remains in the usable voltage range of the instrument , usually -15v to +15v many early synthesizer modules had modules with height in integer inches : 11 '' ( e.g many of these are virtual analog synthesizers , where the modules simulate hardware functionality modules may not be swapped out and usually a typical configuration has been pre-wired reconfigurable systems allow certain signals to be routed through modules in different orders generalized introduction to modular analog synthesis concepts article on modular analog synthesis concepts modularsynth.co network of modular synth manufacturers and producers

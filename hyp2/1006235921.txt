image : moog modular 55 img2.jpg thumb a moog 55 ( c 1981 ) the first modular synthesizer was developed by german engineer harald bode in the late 1950s the 1960s saw the introduction of the moog synthesizer and the buchla electronic musical instruments , created around the same period the moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds , such as envelopes , noise generator , filters , and sequencers , pinch , trevor ; trocco , frank ( 2004 ) by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers german engineer dieter doepfer believed modular synthesizers could still be useful for creating unique sounds , and created the a new , smaller modular system , the doepfer a-100 this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules image : doepfer a-100.jpg thumb a doepfer a-100 ( 1995 to present ) image : ems_at_mim_synthesizer.jpg thumb ems synthi ( vcs & nbsp ; 3 ) ii modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity however , there continued to be a community who chose the physically patched approach , the flexibility and the sound of traditional modular systems '' econtact ! 17.4 & nbsp ; Â‹ analogue and modular synthesis : resurgence and evolution ( february 2016 ) for example , modulating a vco will produce frequency modulation , and may create vibrato , while modulating a vca will produce amplitude modulation , and may create vibrato , depending on the control frequency a trigger in the presence of a gate , applied to an envelope generator produces a single , shaped voltage it can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger in the presence of a gate as a source , depending upon the configuration , it may produce a sequence of voltages , usually set by adjusting values on front panel knobs the sequencer may also output a trigger , and/or gate , at each step ( stage ) designs may allow for stepping forwards or backwards , oscillating patterns , random order , or only using a limited number of stages processors - characterized by a signal input and an output ; it may have control inputs : vcf - voltage-controlled filter , which attenuates frequencies below ( high-pass ) , above ( low-pass ) or both below and above ( band-pass ) a certain frequency vca - voltage-controlled amplifier , is usually a unity-gain amplifier which varies the amplitude of a signal in response to an applied control voltage custom control inputs - it is possible to connect any kind of voltage to a modular synthesizer as long as it remains in the usable voltage range of the instrument , usually -15v to +15v modern manufacturers of modular hardware synthesizers ( alphabetical ) some of them are also virtual modular systems , which simulate real historical modular synthesizers modular analog synthesizers return ! article about new modular systems

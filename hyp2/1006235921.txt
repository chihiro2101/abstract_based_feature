image : moog modular 55 img2.jpg thumb a moog 55 ( c 1981 ) the first modular synthesizer was developed by german engineer harald bode in the late 1950s the japanese company roland released the roland system 100 in 1975 , followed by the system 700 in 1976 and the system 100m in 1979 by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules the basic modular functions are : signal , control , logic/timing typically , inputs and outputs are an electric voltage ) there exist many different types of modules modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity examples of more complex modules include the frequency shifter , sequencer , and vocoder modules can usually be categorized as either sources or processors austin , kevin '' a generalized introduction to modular analogue synthesis concepts lfo - a low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled eg - an envelope generator is a transient voltage source a trigger in the presence of a gate , applied to an envelope generator produces a single , shaped voltage it can be triggered by a keyboard or by another module in the system that produces a rapidly rising trigger in the presence of a gate rm - ring modulator - two audio inputs are utilized to create sum and difference frequencies while suppressing the original signals when used in a control voltage path to an oscillator , this can be used to create glide or portamento between frequencies there are also software synthesizers for personal computers which are organized as interconnectable modules many of these are virtual analog synthesizers , where the modules simulate hardware functionality the different modules of a semi-modular synthesizer are wired together into a typical configuration , but can be re-wired by the user using patch cords reconfigurable systems allow certain signals to be routed through modules in different orders modular music tv website dedicated to tutorials , news , performances and more using modular systems

image : moog modular 55 img2.jpg thumb a moog 55 ( c 1981 ) the first modular synthesizer was developed by german engineer harald bode in the late 1950s the 1960s saw the introduction of the moog synthesizer and the buchla electronic musical instruments , created around the same period the moog was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds , such as envelopes , noise generator , filters , and sequencers , pinch , trevor ; trocco , frank ( 2004 ) analog days : the invention and impact of the moog synthesizer by the 1990s , modular synthesizers had fallen out of favor compared to cheaper , smaller digital and software synthesizers this led to a new standard for modular systems , eurorack ; as of 2017 , over 100 companies , including moog and roland , were developing eurorack modules the basic modular functions are : signal , control , logic/timing typically , inputs and outputs are an electric voltage ) there exist many different types of modules modules with the same basic functions may have different inputs , outputs and controls , depending on their degree of complexity examples of more complex modules include the frequency shifter , sequencer , and vocoder due to the continuously variable nature of knobs and sliders , reproducing an exact patch can be difficult or next to impossible in the late 1970s , modular synthesizers started to be largely supplanted in pop music by highly integrated keyboard synthesizers , racks of midi-connected gear , and samplers common types of noise offered by modular synthesizers include white , pink , and low frequency noise lfo - a low-frequency oscillator may or may not be voltage-controlled sequencer , also sometimes called an analog step sequencer , is a family of compound module types which may be a source or a processor , see also below the sequencer may also output a trigger , and/or gate , at each step ( stage ) sequencer , ( see also above ) , as a processor , may have a signal input into each step , ( location or stage ) , which is output , when stepped to many early synthesizer modules had modules with height in integer inches : 11 '' ( e.g modules may not be swapped out and usually a typical configuration has been pre-wired reconfigurable systems allow certain signals to be routed through modules in different orders modular analog synthesizers return ! article about new modular systems

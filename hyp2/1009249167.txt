the current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building : the original 14 art deco office buildings from the 1930s , one building across 51st street built in 1947 , and a set of four international-style towers built along the west side of avenue of the americas during the 1960s and 1970s the landmarked buildings comprise in midtown , bounded by fifth and sixth avenues between 48th and 51st streets built as a cohesive unit , the buildings have been owned by tishman speyer since 2000 the east side of sixth avenue , officially known as avenue of the americas , contains most of the buildings that were built specifically for the proposed radio complex these buildings , which comprise '' radio city '' , are 1230 avenue of the americas , 30 rockefeller plaza , radio city music hall and 1270 avenue of the americas rubber company building ( now simon & schuster building ) at 1230 avenue of the americas 1230 avenue of the americas was expanded to the east in 1954 after the center theatre adjacent to it was demolished the center theatre , at 1236 sixth avenue , was the only structure in the original rockefeller center to be demolished originally the '' roxy theatre '' , it was renamed after william fox sued roxy rothafel over the naming rights to the nearby roxy theatre , which rothafel had originally managed the 3,700-seat center theatre had a short massing ( general shape ) in place due to height restrictions at the time , which prohibited construction above theater auditoriums it showed film , musicals , ice-skating competitions , and television through its 21-year existence due to its duplication of the larger radio city music hall 's activities , it was deemed uneconomical almost from its opening , and was considered redundant by the 1950s the block immediately to the north , on sixth avenue between 49th and 50th streets , is occupied by 30 rockefeller plaza and its western annex at 1250 sixth avenue opened in 1933 as the rca building , the building has been renamed multiple times , first to the ge building in 1988 , after general electric bought rca , and then to the comcast building in 2014 after comcast 's purchase of nbcuniversal radio city music hall at 1260 avenue of the americas , occupying the southwestern portion of the block between 50th and 51st streets the only remaining theater in the complex , it was similar in style to the center theatre , but at a larger scale the other building on the block between 50th and 51st streets is 1270 avenue of the americas , a 31-story structure with a setback on the sixth floor originally the rko building , it was built over the music hall and shares many of the same exterior architectural details construction of the building started in 1931 , and the building was complete by september 1932 the building 's entrance design , blending in with that of the other buildings in the radio city section , is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by robert garrison for each of the building 's three bays , signifying muses of contemporary thought , morning , and evening the rko building served as headquarters for its namesake company 's movie production in the 1930s , and was renamed for the american metal climax company ( amax ) , its new owners , in the early 1960s the international complex is located entirely along fifth avenue , with the tall international building overshadowing four smaller country-themed buildings with retail outlets three of the buildings—the tall tower and the two southern retail buildings—were planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931 , while the two retail buildings to the north were added later the low rectangular structures that replaced the oval building were seen as a more suitable design for the avenue when viewed from fifth avenue , the buildings provide a foreground for the taller 30 rockefeller plaza building behind them the southernmost of the four retail buildings is la maison francaise ( literally '' the french house '' ) at 610 fifth avenue , which opened in october 1933 it is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback , as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof immediately across the channel gardens to the north of la maison francaise is its twin , the british empire building at 620 fifth avenue , which opened in april 1933 the international building has the address 630 fifth avenue to its east , or 45 rockefeller plaza to its west one of two skyscrapers that opened in manhattan in 1935 , it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction , as well as the construction quality , overall design , and materials used the building , located in the middle of the block between rockefeller plaza and fifth avenue , contains a central plaza on its east , facing the fifth avenue entrance , which contains the famous statue of atlas the palazzo d'italia and international building north serve as six-story retail wings of the international building the palazzo d'italia is located at 626 fifth avenue , on the south side of the plaza , while international building north is located at 636 fifth avenue , north of the plaza the tower was renamed for its street address after general dynamics moved to st 10 rockefeller plaza is located opposite 1 rockefeller , on the west side of the plaza 50 rockefeller plaza , formerly the associated press building , is located on the west side of rockefeller plaza between 50th and 51st streets its l-shaped footprint surrounds another building at the corner of 49th street and fifth avenue , such that it fronts on 48th street , on fifth avenue , but only midblock on 49th street carson and lundin designed 600 fifth avenue , along with 666 fifth avenue three blocks north , to complement the rockefeller complex between the two towers the building contains a main lobby at 48th street , a service entrance to the same street , and a connection to 1 rockefeller plaza at its west end unlike other buildings in the complex , 600 fifth avenue 's ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space , which was originally leased by swiss interests and pan am airlines the first subsequent building to be built was 75 rockefeller plaza , at 51st street on the north end of the complex , was built in 1947 it was originally built privately , but ownership was transferred to rockefeller center in february 1947 the 33-story , building was originally called the esso building the esso building was later renamed after warner communications , time warner and aol time warner the other four buildings were built as part of a single project on the west side of sixth avenue between 47th and 51st streets the following buildings are part of the newer sixth avenue expansion : 1211 avenue of the americas , the former celanese building , is located between 47th and 48th streets now the news corp building , it is owned by an affiliate of beacon capital partners , and leasing is managed by cushman & wakefield the building opened in 1973 and is owned by the rockefeller group 1251 avenue of the americas , the former exxon building , is located between 49th and 50th streets exxon moved its headquarters to texas in 1989 , vacating all of the space in 1251 avenue of the americas the original intention of the street 's construction was to enhance the shopping district of fifth avenue , to its east , but this never happened , and rockefeller plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of rockefeller center 's separate components there is also a connection to the new york city subway 's 47th–50th streets–rockefeller center station , serving the see : one of the center 's more controversial works was man at the crossroads , created by diego rivera , which was originally commissioned for 30 rockefeller plaza 's lobby but was demolished before it could be completed sigfried giedion wrote in his book space , time and architecture that rockefeller center 's design was akin to a '' civic center '' whose design represented the 1930s version of the future

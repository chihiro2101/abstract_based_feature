most scholars identify microstates by using a quantitative threshold and applying it to either one variable ( such as the size of its territory mehmet , o smallness , islandness and foreign policy behaviour : aspects of island microstates foreign policy behaviour with special reference to cook islands and kiribati according to some scholars the quantitative approach to defining microstates suffers from such problems as '' inconsistency , arbitrariness , vagueness and inability to meaningfully isolate qualitatively distinct political units '' newer approaches have proposed looking at the behaviour or capacity to operate in the international arena in order to determine which states should deserve the microstate label an alternative approach , that may overcome these challenges , is to define microstates as '' modern protected states '' according to the definition proposed by dumienski ( 2014 ) : '' microstates are modern protected states , i.e sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints '' adopting this approach permits limiting the number of microstates and separating them from both small states and autonomies or dependencies examples of microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as liechtenstein , san marino , monaco , niue , andorra , the cook islands or palau the smallest political unit recognized as a sovereign state is vatican city statistical research has shown that microstates are more likely to be democracy than larger states this shows that countries with small populations often had a high degree of political freedom and civil liberties , which is one of the hallmarks of democracies this had led some researchers to believe that microstates are forced to subordinate themselves to larger states which reduces their sovereignty examples of this are microstates that establish a tax haven or sell their support in international committees in exchange for military and economic support

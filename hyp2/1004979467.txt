unpredictable random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling , and many randomizing devices such as dice , shuffling playing cards , and roulette wheels , were first developed for such use fairly produced random numbers are vital to electronic gambling and ways of creating them are sometimes regulated by governmental gaming commissions random numbers are also used for non-gambling purposes , both where their use is mathematically important , such as sampling for opinion polls , and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization , such as conscription and selecting jurors the major use for hardware random number generators is in the field of data encryption , for example to create random cryptographic keys and nonces needed to encrypt and sign data they are a more secure alternative to pseudorandom number generators ( prngs ) , software programs commonly used in computers to generate '' random '' numbers although these pseudorandom sequences pass randomness tests , by knowing the algorithm and the conditions used to initialize it , called the '' seed '' , the output can be predicted hardware random number generators produce sequences of numbers that are assumed not to be predictable , and therefore provide the greatest security when used to encrypt data one early way of producing random numbers was by a variation of the same machines used to play keno or select lottery numbers these involved mixed , numbered ping-pong balls with blown air , perhaps combined with mechanical agitation , and used some method to withdraw balls from the mixing chamber for a noise source ( most likely the well known behavior of the 6d4 miniature gas thyratron tube , when placed in a magnetic field ) the block ciphers khufu and khafre are among the applications which use the rand table there are two fundamental sources of practical quantum mechanics physical randomness : quantum mechanics at the atomic or sub-atomic level and thermal noise ( some of which is quantum mechanical in origin ) quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical phenomena , such as the nuclear decay of atoms , '' each nucleus decays spontaneously , at random , in accordance with the blind workings of chance and , because the world exists at a temperature above absolute zero , every system has some random variation in its state ; for instance , molecules of gases composing air are constantly bouncing off each other in a random way ( see statistical mechanics ) this randomness is a quantum phenomenon as well ( see phonon ) because the outcome of quantum-mechanical events can not be predicted even in principle , they are the ‘ gold standard ’ for random number generation some quantum phenomena used for random number generation include : shot noise , a quantum mechanical noise source in electronic circuits collecting the noise for use poses some problems , but this is an especially simple random noise source they are somewhat vulnerable to attack by lowering the temperature of the system , though most systems will stop operating at temperatures low enough to reduce noise by a factor of two ( e.g some of the thermal phenomena used include : thermal noise from a resistor , amplified to provide a random voltage source avalanche noise generated from an avalanche diode , or zener breakdown noise from a reverse-biased zener diode the advantage is that this approach needs , in principle , no special hardware the disadvantage is that a sufficiently knowledgeable attacker can surreptitiously modify the software or its inputs , thus reducing the randomness of the output , perhaps substantially for instance , the forward-security of the generator in linux 2.6.10 kernel could be broken with 2 64 or 2 96 time complexity the intel 82802 firmware hub ( fwh ) chip included a hardware rng intel corporation intel® 810 chipset design guide , june 1999 ch a thermal noise source ( non-commonmode noise from two diodes ) is used to modulate the frequency of the slow oscillator , which then triggers a measurement of the fast oscillator that output is then debiased using a von neumann type decorrelation step ( see below ) this chip was an optional component of the 840 chipset family that supported an earlier intel bus this can improve decorrelation and digit bias at low cost ; it can be done by hardware , such as an fpga , which is faster than doing it by software software engineers without true random number generators often try to develop them by measuring physical events available to the software a true random number generator can be a ( de ) central service these are useful for determining if there is enough entropy in a seed pool , for example , but they can not , in general , distinguish between a true random source and a pseudorandom generator unfortunately , with currently available ( and foreseen ) tests , passing such tests is not enough to be sure the output sequences are random

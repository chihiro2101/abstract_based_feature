unpredictable random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling , and many randomizing devices such as dice , shuffling playing cards , and roulette wheels , were first developed for such use fairly produced random numbers are vital to electronic gambling and ways of creating them are sometimes regulated by governmental gaming commissions random numbers are also used for non-gambling purposes , both where their use is mathematically important , such as sampling for opinion polls , and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization , such as conscription and selecting jurors the major use for hardware random number generators is in the field of data encryption , for example to create random cryptographic keys and nonces needed to encrypt and sign data they are a more secure alternative to pseudorandom number generators ( prngs ) , software programs commonly used in computers to generate '' random '' numbers prngs use a deterministic algorithm to produce numerical sequences because the sequence of numbers produced by a prng is in principle predictable , data encrypted with pseudorandom numbers is potentially vulnerable to cryptanalysis hardware random number generators produce sequences of numbers that are assumed not to be predictable , and therefore provide the greatest security when used to encrypt data one early way of producing random numbers was by a variation of the same machines used to play keno or select lottery numbers this method gives reasonable results in some senses , but the random numbers generated by this means are expensive on 29 april 1947 , rand corporation began generating random digits with an '' electronic roulette wheel '' , consisting of a random frequency pulse source of about 100,000 pulses per second gated once per second with a constant frequency pulse and fed into a five-bit binary counter douglas aircraft built the equipment , implementing cecil hasting 's suggestion ( rand p-113 ) for a noise source ( most likely the well known behavior of the 6d4 miniature gas thyratron tube , when placed in a magnetic field ) physical phenomena with random properties quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical phenomena , such as the nuclear decay of atoms , '' each nucleus decays spontaneously , at random , in accordance with the blind workings of chance '' q for quantum , john gribbin are fundamentally random and can not , in principle , be predicted ( for a discussion of empirical verification of quantum unpredictability , see bell test experiments ) and , because the world exists at a temperature above absolute zero , every system has some random variation in its state ; for instance , molecules of gases composing air are constantly bouncing off each other in a random way ( see statistical mechanics some quantum phenomena used for random number generation include : shot noise , a quantum mechanical noise source in electronic circuits some of the thermal phenomena used include : thermal noise from a resistor , amplified to provide a random voltage source avalanche noise generated from an avalanche diode , or zener breakdown noise from a reverse-biased zener diode in the absence of quantum effects or thermal noise , other phenomena that tend to be random , although in ways not easily characterized by laws of physics , can be used the disadvantage is that a sufficiently knowledgeable attacker can surreptitiously modify the software or its inputs , thus reducing the randomness of the output , perhaps substantially this last approach must be implemented carefully and may be subject to attack if it is not the intel 82802 firmware hub ( fwh ) chip included a hardware rng intel corporation intelÂ® 810 chipset design guide , june 1999 ch the output of two are xored to control the bias on a third oscillator , whose output clocks the output of the fourth oscillator to produce the raw bit minor variations in temperature , silicon characteristics , and local electrical conditions cause continuing oscillator speed variations and thus produce the entropy of the raw bits to further ensure randomness , there are actually two such rngs on each chip , each positioned in different environments and rotated on the silicon user software can access the generated random bit stream using new non-privileged machine language instructions ultra-high speed random number generators often use this method software engineers without true random number generators often try to develop them by measuring physical events available to the software one example of a centralized system where a random number can be acquired is the randomness beacon service from the national institute of standards and technology ; another example is random.org , a service that uses atmospheric noise to generate random binary digits ( bits ) hardware random number generators should be constantly monitored for proper operation unfortunately , with currently available ( and foreseen ) tests , passing such tests is not enough to be sure the output sequences are random

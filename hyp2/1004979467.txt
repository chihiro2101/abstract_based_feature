unpredictable random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling , and many randomizing devices such as dice , shuffling playing cards , and roulette wheels , were first developed for such use fairly produced random numbers are vital to electronic gambling and ways of creating them are sometimes regulated by governmental gaming commissions random numbers are also used for non-gambling purposes , both where their use is mathematically important , such as sampling for opinion polls , and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization , such as conscription and selecting jurors the major use for hardware random number generators is in the field of data encryption , for example to create random cryptographic keys and nonces needed to encrypt and sign data they are a more secure alternative to pseudorandom number generators ( prngs ) , software programs commonly used in computers to generate '' random '' numbers although these pseudorandom sequences pass randomness tests , by knowing the algorithm and the conditions used to initialize it , called the '' seed '' , the output can be predicted because the sequence of numbers produced by a prng is in principle predictable , data encrypted with pseudorandom numbers is potentially vulnerable to cryptanalysis hardware random number generators produce sequences of numbers that are assumed not to be predictable , and therefore provide the greatest security when used to encrypt data one early way of producing random numbers was by a variation of the same machines used to play keno or select lottery numbers this method gives reasonable results in some senses , but the random numbers generated by this means are expensive for a noise source ( most likely the well known behavior of the 6d4 miniature gas thyratron tube , when placed in a magnetic field ) . the results of a long run from the rand machine , filtered and tested , were converted into a table , which was published in 1955 in the book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates the rand table was a significant breakthrough in delivering random numbers because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available there are two fundamental sources of practical quantum mechanics physical randomness : quantum mechanics at the atomic or sub-atomic level and thermal noise ( some of which is quantum mechanical in origin ) quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical phenomena , such as the nuclear decay of atoms , '' each nucleus decays spontaneously , at random , in accordance with the blind workings of chance '' q for quantum , john gribbin are fundamentally random and can not , in principle , be predicted ( for a discussion of empirical verification of quantum unpredictability , see bell test experiments ) and , because the world exists at a temperature above absolute zero , every system has some random variation in its state ; for instance , molecules of gases composing air are constantly bouncing off each other in a random way ( see statistical mechanics some quantum phenomena used for random number generation include : shot noise , a quantum mechanical noise source in electronic circuits collecting the noise for use poses some problems , but this is an especially simple random noise source they are somewhat vulnerable to attack by lowering the temperature of the system , though most systems will stop operating at temperatures low enough to reduce noise by a factor of two ( e.g in the absence of quantum effects or thermal noise , other phenomena that tend to be random , although in ways not easily characterized by laws of physics , can be used when several such sources are combined carefully ( as in , for example , the yarrow algorithm or fortuna csprngs ) , enough entropy can be collected for the creation of cryptographic keys and nonces , though generally at restricted rates the output of two are xored to control the bias on a third oscillator , whose output clocks the output of the fourth oscillator to produce the raw bit a software implementation of a related idea on ordinary hardware is included in cryptolib , a cryptographic routine library it uses an operating system service that sets an alarm , running off the real-time clock one subroutine sets that alarm to go off in one clock tick ( usually 1/60th of a second ) there are several techniques for reducing bias and correlation , often called '' whitening '' algorithms , by analogy with the related problem of producing white noise from a correlated signal many physical phenomena can be used to generate bits that are highly biased , but each bit is independent from the others in some implementations , the prng is run for a limited number of digits , while the hardware generating device produces a new seed software engineers without true random number generators often try to develop them by measuring physical events available to the software the basic design is to maintain an '' entropy pool '' of random bits that are assumed to be unknown to an attacker one example of a centralized system where a random number can be acquired is the randomness beacon service from the national institute of standards and technology ; another example is random.org , a service that uses atmospheric noise to generate random binary digits ( bits ) these are useful for determining if there is enough entropy in a seed pool , for example , but they can not , in general , distinguish between a true random source and a pseudorandom generator

unpredictable random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling , and many randomizing devices such as dice , shuffling playing cards , and roulette wheels , were first developed for such use fairly produced random numbers are vital to electronic gambling and ways of creating them are sometimes regulated by governmental gaming commissions random numbers are also used for non-gambling purposes , both where their use is mathematically important , such as sampling for opinion polls , and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization , such as conscription and selecting jurors the major use for hardware random number generators is in the field of data encryption , for example to create random cryptographic keys and nonces needed to encrypt and sign data they are a more secure alternative to pseudorandom number generators ( prngs ) , software programs commonly used in computers to generate '' random '' numbers although these pseudorandom sequences pass randomness tests , by knowing the algorithm and the conditions used to initialize it , called the '' seed '' , the output can be predicted because the sequence of numbers produced by a prng is in principle predictable , data encrypted with pseudorandom numbers is potentially vulnerable to cryptanalysis hardware random number generators produce sequences of numbers that are assumed not to be predictable , and therefore provide the greatest security when used to encrypt data one early way of producing random numbers was by a variation of the same machines used to play keno or select lottery numbers these involved mixed , numbered ping-pong balls with blown air , perhaps combined with mechanical agitation , and used some method to withdraw balls from the mixing chamber on 29 april 1947 , rand corporation began generating random digits with an '' electronic roulette wheel '' , consisting of a random frequency pulse source of about 100,000 pulses per second gated once per second with a constant frequency pulse and fed into a five-bit binary counter for a noise source ( most likely the well known behavior of the 6d4 miniature gas thyratron tube , when placed in a magnetic field ) . the results of a long run from the rand machine , filtered and tested , were converted into a table , which was published in 1955 in the book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates the rand table was a significant breakthrough in delivering random numbers because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available the block ciphers khufu and khafre are among the applications which use the rand table quantum mechanics predicts that certain physical phenomena , such as the nuclear decay of atoms , '' each nucleus decays spontaneously , at random , in accordance with the blind workings of chance '' q for quantum , john gribbin are fundamentally random and can not , in principle , be predicted ( for a discussion of empirical verification of quantum unpredictability , see bell test experiments ) and , because the world exists at a temperature above absolute zero , every system has some random variation in its state ; for instance , molecules of gases composing air are constantly bouncing off each other in a random way ( see statistical mechanics some quantum phenomena used for random number generation include : shot noise , a quantum mechanical noise source in electronic circuits . a nuclear decay radiation source , detected by a geiger counter attached to a pc some of the thermal phenomena used include : thermal noise from a resistor , amplified to provide a random voltage source noise ( radio ) , detected by a radio receiver attached to a pc ( though much of it , such as lightning noise , is not properly thermal noise , but most likely a chaotic phenomenon ) in the absence of quantum effects or thermal noise , other phenomena that tend to be random , although in ways not easily characterized by laws of physics , can be used the advantage is that this approach needs , in principle , no special hardware for instance , the forward-security of the generator in linux 2.6.10 kernel could be broken with 2 64 or 2 96 time complexity the intel 82802 firmware hub ( fwh ) chip included a hardware rng intel corporation intelÂ® 810 chipset design guide , june 1999 ch minor variations in temperature , silicon characteristics , and local electrical conditions cause continuing oscillator speed variations and thus produce the entropy of the raw bits ultra-high speed random number generators often use this method many physical phenomena can be used to generate bits that are highly biased , but each bit is independent from the others however , with sufficient care , a system can be designed that produces cryptographically secure random numbers from the sources of randomness available in a modern computer new randomness is added whenever available ( for example , when the user hits a key ) and an estimate of the number of bits in the pool that can not be known to an attacker is kept hardware random number generators should be constantly monitored for proper operation unfortunately , with currently available ( and foreseen ) tests , passing such tests is not enough to be sure the output sequences are random

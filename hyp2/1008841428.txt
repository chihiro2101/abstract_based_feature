. effects of mercury and acid rain pollution on health and brood productivity acid rain and mercury levels in aquatic environments are positively correlated as increases in acid rain lead to elevated levels of sulfur oxides that are used by sulfate-reducing bacteria to enhance methylmercury production mercury levels and ph are also correlated as experiments have shown that increases in ph are correlated with a decrease in mercury levels resulting from this transmission of mercury , there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male , female , and chick blood of common loons ; consequently , an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in ph male common loons were found to contain the highest blood mercury concentration likely due to the fact that they tend to consume bigger fish with higher mercury concentrations females contained the second highest blood mercury concentration with differences between the males likely being due to the fact that females can expel mercury into the eggs they lay studies have deduced that elevated levels of mercury in the blood of common loons have detrimental effects on brood productivity one such study found that brood productivity was reduced by half when female blood mercury levels exceeded 4.3 μg/g and productivity completely failed when female blood mercury levels exceeded 8.6 μg/g due to elevated mercury levels in lakes that common loons inhabit , many studies have revealed that a large number of common loons tested are at high risk for detrimental impacts on health and reproduction in addition , a study conducted on common loons in quebec determined that 33 % of the loons tested were at high risk for detrimental effects on health and reproduction the common loon has also faced a decline in breeding range due to hunting , predation , and water-level fluctuations , or flooding

the effects of mercury and acid rain pollution are considered to be among some of the most important factors in the reproductive success of common loons across the upper united states and lower canada , studies have shown that lake acidity tends to increase from west to east likely stemming from fossil fuel combustion that releases mercury and other harmful components of acid rain which are then moved eastward by prevailing winds acid rain and mercury levels in aquatic environments are positively correlated as increases in acid rain lead to elevated levels of sulfur oxides that are used by sulfate-reducing bacteria to enhance methylmercury production mercury levels and ph are also correlated as experiments have shown that increases in ph are correlated with a decrease in mercury levels in this case , mercury levels are passed in the order of crayfish , zooplankton , pre fish , fish and then the common loon resulting from this transmission of mercury , there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male , female , and chick blood of common loons ; consequently , an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in ph male common loons were found to contain the highest blood mercury concentration likely due to the fact that they tend to consume bigger fish with higher mercury concentrations one such study found that brood productivity was reduced by half when female blood mercury levels exceeded 4.3 μg/g and productivity completely failed when female blood mercury levels exceeded 8.6 μg/g as mercury levels and ph are correlated , scientists have found that brood success decreases with decreasing ph such that environments with a ph at around 4.5 exhibited reproductive success below a calculated positive growth rate threshold due to elevated mercury levels in lakes that common loons inhabit , many studies have revealed that a large number of common loons tested are at high risk for detrimental impacts on health and reproduction folk names for the common loon include '' big loon '' , '' call-up-a-storm '' , '' greenhead '' , '' hell-diver '' , '' walloon '' , '' black-billed loon '' , '' guinea duck '' , '' imber diver '' , '' ring-necked loon '' , and '' ember-goose ''

the effects of mercury and acid rain pollution are considered to be among some of the most important factors in the reproductive success of common loons acid rain and mercury levels in aquatic environments are positively correlated as increases in acid rain lead to elevated levels of sulfur oxides that are used by sulfate-reducing bacteria to enhance methylmercury production in this case , mercury levels are passed in the order of crayfish , zooplankton , pre fish , fish and then the common loon resulting from this transmission of mercury , there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male , female , and chick blood of common loons ; consequently , an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in ph male common loons were found to contain the highest blood mercury concentration likely due to the fact that they tend to consume bigger fish with higher mercury concentrations females contained the second highest blood mercury concentration with differences between the males likely being due to the fact that females can expel mercury into the eggs they lay studies have deduced that elevated levels of mercury in the blood of common loons have detrimental effects on brood productivity due to elevated mercury levels in lakes that common loons inhabit , many studies have revealed that a large number of common loons tested are at high risk for detrimental impacts on health and reproduction the common loon 's breeding range has moved northward , the species breeding as far south as iowa a century ago folk names for the common loon include '' big loon '' , '' call-up-a-storm '' , '' greenhead '' , '' hell-diver '' , '' walloon '' , '' black-billed loon '' , '' guinea duck '' , '' imber diver '' , '' ring-necked loon '' , and '' ember-goose '' the common loon appears on canadian currency , including the loonie coin and the previous series of 20 bills

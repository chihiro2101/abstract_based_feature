. effects of mercury and acid rain pollution on health and brood productivity the effects of mercury and acid rain pollution are considered to be among some of the most important factors in the reproductive success of common loons mercury levels and ph are also correlated as experiments have shown that increases in ph are correlated with a decrease in mercury levels in this case , mercury levels are passed in the order of crayfish , zooplankton , pre fish , fish and then the common loon resulting from this transmission of mercury , there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male , female , and chick blood of common loons ; consequently , an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in ph male common loons were found to contain the highest blood mercury concentration likely due to the fact that they tend to consume bigger fish with higher mercury concentrations females contained the second highest blood mercury concentration with differences between the males likely being due to the fact that females can expel mercury into the eggs they lay studies have deduced that elevated levels of mercury in the blood of common loons have detrimental effects on brood productivity one such study found that brood productivity was reduced by half when female blood mercury levels exceeded 4.3 μg/g and productivity completely failed when female blood mercury levels exceeded 8.6 μg/g as mercury levels and ph are correlated , scientists have found that brood success decreases with decreasing ph such that environments with a ph at around 4.5 exhibited reproductive success below a calculated positive growth rate threshold due to elevated mercury levels in lakes that common loons inhabit , many studies have revealed that a large number of common loons tested are at high risk for detrimental impacts on health and reproduction

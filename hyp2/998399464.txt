the writ was a unique development of the anglo-saxon monarchs and consisted of a brief administrative order , authenticated ( innovatively ) by a seal wickson , the community of the realm in 13th c england ( london 1970 ) p the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary , in most cases , to have a case heard in one of the royal courts , such as the king 's bench or common pleas some franchise courts , especially in the county palatine , had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs the writ was '' served '' on ( delivered in person to ) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ , or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient where a plaintiff wished to have a case heard by a local court , or by an eyre if one happened to be visiting the county , there would be no need to obtain a writ however , if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the king 's courts , then he would need a writ , a command of the king , to enable him to do this for most royal courts , the writ would usually have been purchased from the chancery , although the court of the exchequer , being , in essence , another government department , was able to issue its own writs while originally writs were exceptional , or at least non-routine devices , maitland suggests that by the time of king henry ii ( 1154–1189 ) , the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in england the problem with this approach was that a plaintiff 's rights and available forms of action at his disposal , would be defined , and in most cases limited , by the limited variety of writs available to him moreover , a writ , if one could be found fitting the plaintiff 's case , provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court , often controlled by a lesser noble , and instead have it heard by the king 's judges new writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static , each writ defining a particular form of action 1716 ) discussed in house of lords in 1980 , writs applied to claims that were to be heard in one of the courts which eventually formed part of the high court of justice in some westminster systems , for example canada and some other parliamentary systems , the phrase 'dropping the writ ' refers colloquially to a dissolution of parliament and the beginning of an election campaign to form a new one '' however , the federal rules of civil procedure , adopted in 1938 to govern civil procedure in the united states district courts , provide that there is only one form of action in civil cases , and explicitly abolish certain writs by name federal courts : the writ of habeas corpus , usually used to test the legality of a prisoner 's detention , has expressly been preserved in the united states federal courts , the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by state courts by statute , the supreme court of the united states uses the writ of certiorari to review cases from the united states courts of appeals or from the state courts some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case , a united states district court may use the common law writ of error coram nobis under the all writs act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available under the indian legal system , jurisdiction to issue 'prerogative writs ' is given to the supreme court , and to the high courts of judicature of all indian states

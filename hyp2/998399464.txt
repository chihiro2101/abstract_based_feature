in the beginning , writs were the document issued by the king 's chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the king about an injustice , after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless 293 writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors , but it was not until henry the second that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice , thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures the previous system of justice at the royal court of chancery was tailor-made to suit each case and was thus highly time-consuming thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary , in most cases , to have a case heard in one of the royal courts , such as the king 's bench or common pleas some franchise courts , especially in the county palatine , had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs where a plaintiff wished to have a case heard by a local court , or by an eyre if one happened to be visiting the county , there would be no need to obtain a writ however , if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the king 's courts , then he would need a writ , a command of the king , to enable him to do this initially , for common law , recourse to the king 's courts was unusual , and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay for most royal courts , the writ would usually have been purchased from the chancery , although the court of the exchequer , being , in essence , another government department , was able to issue its own writs while originally writs were exceptional , or at least non-routine devices , maitland suggests that by the time of king henry ii ( 1154–1189 ) , the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in england the problem with this approach was that a plaintiff 's rights and available forms of action at his disposal , would be defined , and in most cases limited , by the limited variety of writs available to him moreover , a writ , if one could be found fitting the plaintiff 's case , provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court , often controlled by a lesser noble , and instead have it heard by the king 's judges new writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static , each writ defining a particular form of action '' however , the federal rules of civil procedure , adopted in 1938 to govern civil procedure in the united states district courts , provide that there is only one form of action in civil cases , and explicitly abolish certain writs by name in the united states federal courts , the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by state courts in extraordinary circumstances , the united states court of appeals can use the common law writ of prohibition under the all writs act to control proceedings in the district courts in modern times , the all writs act is most commonly used as authority for federal courts to issue injunctions to protect their jurisdiction or effectuate their judgments under the indian legal system , jurisdiction to issue 'prerogative writs ' is given to the supreme court , and to the high courts of judicature of all indian states the constitution broadly provides for five kinds of '' prerogative '' writs : habeas corpus , certiorari , mandamus , quo warranto and prohibition : the writ of prohibition ( forbid ) is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court the writ of habeas corpus ( to have the body of ) is issued to a detaining authority , ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court , along with the cause of his or her detention

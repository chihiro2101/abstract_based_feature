the writ was a unique development of the anglo-saxon monarchs and consisted of a brief administrative order , authenticated ( innovatively ) by a seal in the beginning , writs were the document issued by the king 's chancellor against a landowner whose vassal complained to the king about an injustice , after a first summon by the sheriff to comply had been deemed fruitless 293 writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors , but it was not until henry the second that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice , thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures the complainant simply applied to the court for the writ most relevant to his complaint to be sent to the wrongdoer , which ordered him under royal authority to attend a royal court to answer for his actions thus eventually the obtaining of a writ became necessary , in most cases , to have a case heard in one of the royal courts , such as the king 's bench or common pleas some franchise courts , especially in the county palatine , had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs the writ was '' served '' on ( delivered in person to ) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ , or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient where a plaintiff wished to have a case heard by a local court , or by an eyre if one happened to be visiting the county , there would be no need to obtain a writ however , if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the king 's courts , then he would need a writ , a command of the king , to enable him to do this while originally writs were exceptional , or at least non-routine devices , maitland suggests that by the time of king henry ii ( 1154–1189 ) , the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in england moreover , a writ , if one could be found fitting the plaintiff 's case , provided the legal means to remove the dispute from the jurisdiction of the local court , often controlled by a lesser noble , and instead have it heard by the king 's judges in 1999 , the woolf reforms unified most of the procedure of the supreme court and the county courts in civil matters under these , almost all civil actions , other than those connected with insolvency , are now commenced by the completion of a 'claim form ' as opposed to the obtaining of a 'writ ' , 'originating application ' , or 'summons ' ( see rules 7 and 8 of the civil procedure rules ) in some westminster systems , for example canada and some other parliamentary systems , the phrase 'dropping the writ ' refers colloquially to a dissolution of parliament and the beginning of an election campaign to form a new one early law of the united states inherited the traditional english writ system , in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law courts were authorized to grant '' however , the federal rules of civil procedure , adopted in 1938 to govern civil procedure in the united states district courts , provide that there is only one form of action in civil cases , and explicitly abolish certain writs by name in the united states federal courts , the writ is most often used to review the constitutionality of criminal convictions rendered by state courts in extraordinary circumstances , the united states court of appeals can use the common law writ of prohibition under the all writs act to control proceedings in the district courts some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case , a united states district court may use the common law writ of error coram nobis under the all writs act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available under the indian legal system , jurisdiction to issue 'prerogative writs ' is given to the supreme court , and to the high courts of judicature of all indian states

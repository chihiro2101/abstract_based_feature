the writ was a unique development of the anglo-saxon monarchs and consisted of a brief administrative order , authenticated ( innovatively ) by a seal 293 writs of instruction continued to develop under his immediate successors , but it was not until henry the second that writs became available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice , thus initiating a vast expansion in their role within the common law the development of writs as a means of commencing a court action was a form of '' off-the-shelf '' justice designed to enable the english law courts to rapidly process lawsuits by allocating each form of complaint into a standard category which could be dealt with by standard procedures some franchise courts , especially in the county palatine , had their own system of writs which often reflected or anticipated the common law writs the writ was '' served '' on ( delivered in person to ) the wrongdoer and acted as a command that he should appear at a specified time and date before the court specified in the writ , or it might command some other act on the part of the recipient where a plaintiff wished to have a case heard by a local court , or by an eyre if one happened to be visiting the county , there would be no need to obtain a writ however , if a plaintiff wished to avail himself of royal — and by implication superior — justice in one of the king 's courts , then he would need a writ , a command of the king , to enable him to do this initially , for common law , recourse to the king 's courts was unusual , and something for which a plaintiff would have to pay for most royal courts , the writ would usually have been purchased from the chancery , although the court of the exchequer , being , in essence , another government department , was able to issue its own writs while originally writs were exceptional , or at least non-routine devices , maitland suggests that by the time of king henry ii ( 1154–1189 ) , the use of writs had become a regular part of the system of royal justice in england new writs were created after that time only by the express sanction of parliament and the forms of writ remained essentially static , each writ defining a particular form of action with the abolition of the form of action in 1832 and 1833 , a profusion of writs was no longer needed , and one uniform writ came into use this phrase derives from the fact that to hold an election in such a system a writ of election must be issued on behalf of the monarch ordering the high sheriffs of each county to set in motion the procedure for elections early law of the united states inherited the traditional english writ system , in the sense of a rigid set of forms of relief that the law courts were authorized to grant the all writs act authorizes united states federal courts to '' issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law relief formerly available by a writ is now normally available by a lawsuit ( civil action ) or a motion in a pending civil action by statute , the supreme court of the united states uses the writ of certiorari to review cases from the united states courts of appeals or from the state courts some courts have held that in rare circumstances in a federal criminal case , a united states district court may use the common law writ of error coram nobis under the all writs act to set aside a conviction when no other remedy is available in an attempt to purge latin from the language of the law , california law has for many years used the term writ of mandate in place of writ of mandamus , and writ of review in place of writ of certiorari under the indian legal system , jurisdiction to issue 'prerogative writs ' is given to the supreme court , and to the high courts of judicature of all indian states the constitution broadly provides for five kinds of '' prerogative '' writs : habeas corpus , certiorari , mandamus , quo warranto and prohibition : the writ of prohibition ( forbid ) is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court

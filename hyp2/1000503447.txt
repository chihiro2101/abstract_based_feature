researchers martijn van zomeren , tom postmes , and russell spears conducted a meta-analysis of over 180 studies of collective action , in an attempt to integrate three dominant socio-psychological perspectives explaining antecedent conditions to this phenomenon – injustice , efficacy , and identity in their resultant 2008 review article , an integrative social identity model of collective action ( simca ) was proposed which accounts for interrelationships among the three predictors as well as their predictive capacities for collective action examining collective action through perceived injustice was initially guided by relative deprivation theory moving beyond rdt , scholars suggested that in addition to a sense of injustice , people must also have the objective , structural resources necessary to mobilize change through social protest an important psychological development saw this research instead directed towards subjective expectations and beliefs that unified effort ( collective action ) is a viable option for achieving group-based goals – this is referred to as perceived collective efficacy empirically , collective efficacy is shown to causally affect collective action among a number of populations across varied contexts meta-analysis results also confirm that social identity causally predicts collective action across a number of diverse contexts additionally , the integrated simca affords another important role to social identity – that of a psychological bridge forming the collective base from which both collective efficacy and group injustice may be conceived while there is sound empirical support for the causal importance of simca 's key theoretical variables on collective action , more recent literature has addressed the issue of reverse causation , finding support for a related , yet distinct , encapsulation model of social identity in collective action ( emsica ) this model suggests that perceived group efficacy and perceived injustice provide the basis from which social identity emerges , highlighting an alternative causal pathway to collective action the economic theory of collective action is concerned with the provision of public goods ( and other collective consumption ) through the collaboration of two or more individuals , and the impact of externality on group behavior mancur olson 's 1965 book the logic of collective action , is an important early analysis of the problems of public good cost the term collective action problem describes the situation in which multiple individuals would all benefit from a certain action , but has an associated cost making it implausible that any individual can or will undertake and solve it alone situations like this include the prisoner 's dilemma , a collective action problem in which no communication is allowed , the free rider problem , and the tragedy of the commons , also known as the problem with open access it can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good , as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly ( otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good ) in addition to the psychological mechanisms of collective action as explained by the social identity model , researchers have developed sociological models of why collective action exists and have studied under what conditions collective action emerges consensus is distinct from the collective action problem in that there often is not an explicit goal , benefit , or cost of action but rather it concerns itself with a social equilibrium of the individuals involved ( and their beliefs ) leveraging this model of consensus , researchers have shown that local peer influence can be used to reach a global consensus and cooperation across the entire network while this model of consensus and cooperation has been shown to be successful in certain contexts , research suggest that communication and social influence can not be fully captured by simple contagion models and as such a pure contagion based model of consensus may have limits

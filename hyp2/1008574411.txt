if done well , many of the other problems of woofer design ( for instance , linear excursion requirements ) are reduced in most cases the woofer and its enclosure must be designed to work together usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion an early version of the now widely used bass-reflex cabinet design was patented by albert l in 1965 , sennheiser electronics introduced the philharmonic sound system , which used electronics to overcome some of the problems ordinary woofer subsystems confront they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier because the characteristics of a loudspeaker can be measured , and to a considerable extent predicted , it is possible to design special circuitry that somewhat compensates for the deficiencies of a speaker system the frame , or basket , is the structure holding the cone , voice coil and magnet in the proper alignment there are three types of power handling in loudspeaker drivers , including woofers : thermal ( heat ) , electrical ( both covered above ) , and mechanical woofers designed for public address system ( pa ) and instrument amplifier applications are similar in makeup to home audio woofers , except that they are usually designed more ruggedly on the other hand , a pa/instrument woofer in a home audio application will not have the same quality of performance , particularly at low volumes a home stereo woofer , because it is used at relatively low volumes , may be able to handle very low frequencies at ordinary sound pressure , most humans can hear down to about 20 & nbsp ; hz

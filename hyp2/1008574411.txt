good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier if carefully done , this can improve performance ( both in 'tightness ' , and extension of low frequency performance ) considerably at the expense of flexibility ( the amplifier and the speaker are tied together permanently ) and cost as electronics costs have decreased , it has become common to have sensor-equipped woofers in inexpensive 'music systems ' , boom boxes , or even car audio systems this is usually done in an attempt to get better performance from inexpensive or undersized drivers in lightweight or poorly designed enclosures in this case , the equalization must be individually adjusted to match the particular characteristics of the loudspeaker systems used and the room in which they are used in high-volume situations , a woofer 's voice coil will heat up , increase its resistance , causing '' power compression '' , a condition where output sound power level decreases after extended high power activity sudden impulse energy can melt a section of voice coil wire , causing an open circuit and a dead woofer ; the necessary level will vary with driver characteristics adhesives can melt , the voice coil former can melt or distort , or the insulation separating the voice coil windings can fail a home stereo woofer , because it is used at relatively low volumes , may be able to handle very low frequencies the larger the room , the more air the woofer 's movement will have to displace in order to produce the required sound power at low frequencies loudspeaker enclosure audio crossover full-range speaker tweeter super tweeter midrange speaker subwoofer thiele/small motional feedback

good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion there are also challenges in presenting to the amplifier an electrical impedance which is not too far from constant at all frequencies an early version of the now widely used bass-reflex cabinet design was patented by albert l if carefully done , this can improve performance ( both in 'tightness ' , and extension of low frequency performance ) considerably at the expense of flexibility ( the amplifier and the speaker are tied together permanently ) and cost an important woofer specification is its power rating , the amount of power the woofer can handle without damage woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes : applications requiring high output , amplifier overload conditions , unusual signals ( i.e , non-musical ones ) , very low frequencies at which the enclosure provides little or no acoustic loading ( and so there will be maximum cone excursion ) , or amplifier failure woofers designed for public address system ( pa ) and instrument amplifier applications are similar in makeup to home audio woofers , except that they are usually designed more ruggedly pa system woofers typically have high efficiency and high power handling capacity a home stereo woofer , because it is used at relatively low volumes , may be able to handle very low frequencies because of this , most pa woofers are not well suited to use in high quality high fidelity home applications , and vice versa the larger the room , the more air the woofer 's movement will have to displace in order to produce the required sound power at low frequencies

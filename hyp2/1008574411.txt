good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air in most cases the woofer and its enclosure must be designed to work together usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter a audio crossover , either passive or active , filters the band of frequencies to be handled by the woofer and other speakers most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier this is usually done in an attempt to get better performance from inexpensive or undersized drivers in lightweight or poorly designed enclosures because the characteristics of a loudspeaker can be measured , and to a considerable extent predicted , it is possible to design special circuitry that somewhat compensates for the deficiencies of a speaker system in this case , the equalization must be individually adjusted to match the particular characteristics of the loudspeaker systems used and the room in which they are used the frame , or basket , is the structure holding the cone , voice coil and magnet in the proper alignment in high-volume situations , a woofer 's voice coil will heat up , increase its resistance , causing '' power compression '' , a condition where output sound power level decreases after extended high power activity adhesives can melt , the voice coil former can melt or distort , or the insulation separating the voice coil windings can fail at ordinary sound pressure , most humans can hear down to about 20 & nbsp ; hz the larger the room , the more air the woofer 's movement will have to displace in order to produce the required sound power at low frequencies

good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency , and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter a audio crossover , either passive or active , filters the band of frequencies to be handled by the woofer and other speakers most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier as electronics costs have decreased , it has become common to have sensor-equipped woofers in inexpensive 'music systems ' , boom boxes , or even car audio systems woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes : applications requiring high output , amplifier overload conditions , unusual signals ( i.e further heating can physically distort the voice coil , causing scuffing , shorting due to wire insulation deterioration , or other electrical or mechanical damage there are three types of power handling in loudspeaker drivers , including woofers : thermal ( heat ) , electrical ( both covered above ) , and mechanical woofers designed for public address system ( pa ) and instrument amplifier applications are similar in makeup to home audio woofers , except that they are usually designed more ruggedly generally , a home woofer used in a pa/instrument application can be expected to fail more quickly than a pa/instrument woofer pa system woofers typically have high efficiency and high power handling capacity a home stereo woofer , because it is used at relatively low volumes , may be able to handle very low frequencies because of this , most pa woofers are not well suited to use in high quality high fidelity home applications , and vice versa

if done well , many of the other problems of woofer design ( for instance , linear excursion requirements ) are reduced in most cases the woofer and its enclosure must be designed to work together usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used the size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths ( lowest frequencies ) to be reproduced , and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and tweeter a audio crossover , either passive or active , filters the band of frequencies to be handled by the woofer and other speakers most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer 's voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone 's motion in 1965 , sennheiser electronics introduced the philharmonic sound system , which used electronics to overcome some of the problems ordinary woofer subsystems confront they added a motion sensor to the woofer , and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier equalization techniques are used in most public address and sound reinforcement applications an important woofer specification is its power rating , the amount of power the woofer can handle without damage woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes : applications requiring high output , amplifier overload conditions , unusual signals ( i.e further heating can physically distort the voice coil , causing scuffing , shorting due to wire insulation deterioration , or other electrical or mechanical damage pa system woofers typically have high efficiency and high power handling capacity a home stereo woofer , because it is used at relatively low volumes , may be able to handle very low frequencies the larger the room , the more air the woofer 's movement will have to displace in order to produce the required sound power at low frequencies

apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not this explains why many designs use tracks in addition to or instead of wheels , and in some cases even resort to articulated body configurations or other unconventional designs such as screw-propelled vehicles which use auger-like barrels which propel a vehicle through muddy terrain with a twisting motion most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller these can take the form of inflatable floatation devices , much like the sides of a rubber dinghy , or a waterproof fabric skirt raised from the top perimeter of the vehicle , to increase its displacement for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages , the invention of which is credited to the neapolitan polymath prince raimondo di sangro of sansevero in july 1770 or earlier , or samuel bentham whose design of 1781 was built in june 1787 in the 1870s , logging companies in eastern canada and the northern united states developed a steam-powered amphibious tug called an '' alligator '' which could cross between lakes and rivers one of the first reasonably well-documented cases was the 1905 amphibious petrol-powered carriage of t the single front wheel provided direction , both on land and in the water in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water the vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells , allowing the vehicles to plane on water these vehicles can transition between land and water modes in about five seconds iguana yachts , a france company created in 2008 , has developed amphibious motorboats featuring all-terrain tracks sealegs amphibious craft , a three-wheeled amphibious boat designed in new zealand , has been in production since 2005 in 2010 , a southern california-based company named watercar , set the guinness world record for fastest amphibious vehicle , with their prototype , the python , which reached top land speeds of 204 & nbsp ; km/h ( 127 & nbsp ; mph ) and water speeds of 96 & nbsp ; km/h ( 60 & nbsp ; mph ; 52 knots ) since then , the company launched their first commercial vehicle , the panther , which has been featured on abc 's the bachelor as well as usa 's royal pains introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines , that will provide roughly 25 & nbsp ; mph ( 40 & nbsp ; km/h ) top speed on land constructed this way , an aatv will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps , ponds , and streams as well as dry land on land these units have high grip and great off-road ability , that can be further enhanced with an optional set of tracks that can be mounted directly onto the wheels although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water the quadski was developed using gibbs ' high-speed amphibian technology , which gibbs originally developed for the aquada , an amphibious car , which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues the most proliferous was the german schwimmwagen , a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in world war ii the amphibious bodywork was designed by erwin komenda , the firm 's body construction designer , using the engine and drive train of the kübelwagen with almost 4,000 pieces built , the amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date regulatory approval for the aquada the southern california-based company , watercar , founded by dave march , has also built four working amphibious prototypes , one which holds the guinness world record for world 's fastest amphibious vehicle ( the python ) amfibus amphibious buses made by dutch amfibious transport ( dat ) in nijmegen , netherlands are used to operate tours of amsterdam , rotterdam and lübeck , under the splashtours brand a similar service , using different vehicles , operates in porto some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land the distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water , with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality , rather than being the main function during the vietnam war , the us army used the amphibious articulated gama goat and the larger m520 goer truck-series to move supplies through the canals and paddy field of southeast asia coupled with its amphibious capability , in the vietnam war , the m520 goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not the british army used the 6x6 wheeled alvis stalwart as their amphibious cargo carrier many modern military vehicles , ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance vehicles , through armoured personnel carriers ( apcs ) , tanks and amphibious warfare ships , are manufactured with amphibious capabilities some civilian deep wading vehicles achieve their capability by means of legs or stilts to raise the body of the vehicle from its wheels acvs have a high speed over water ( an sr.n4 mk.1 could do 83 knots ( 95 & nbsp ; mph or 154 & nbsp ; km/h ) ) and can make the transition between land and water at speed—unlike most wheeled or tracked amphibians for some military applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft

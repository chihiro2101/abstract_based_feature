apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller this is possible as a vehicle 's displacement is usually greater than its weight , and thus it will float heavily armoured vehicles however sometimes have a density greater than water ( their weight in kilograms exceeds their volume in litres ) and will need additional buoyancy measures for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages , the invention of which is credited to the neapolitan polymath prince raimondo di sangro of sansevero in july 1770 or earlier , or samuel bentham whose design of 1781 was built in june 1787 the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam inventor gail borden , better known for condensed milk , designed and tested a sail-powered wagon in 1849 the single front wheel provided direction , both on land and in the water remarkably the boat-like hull was one of the first integral bodies ever used on a car since the 1920s , many diverse amphibious vehicles designs have been created for a broad range of applications , including recreation , expeditions , search & rescue , and military , leading to a myriad of concepts and variants in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water the vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells , allowing the vehicles to plane on water iguana yachts , a france company created in 2008 , has developed amphibious motorboats featuring all-terrain tracks since then , the company launched their first commercial vehicle , the panther , which has been featured on abc 's the bachelor as well as usa 's royal pains the watercar can do 80 & nbsp ; mph ( 129 & nbsp ; km/h ) on land , and 44 & nbsp ; mph ( 38 knots ; 71 & nbsp ; km/h ) on sea , and can transition from land to sea in less than 15 seconds introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land the model can reach up to 80 & nbsp ; mph by land and 45 & nbsp ; mph by water amongst the smallest non-air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious atvs ( all-terrain vehicles ) although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water the quadski was developed using gibbs ' high-speed amphibian technology , which gibbs originally developed for the aquada , an amphibious car , which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues a specially modified gpa , called half-safe , was driven and sailed around the world by australian ben carlin in the 1950s purely recreational amphibian cars include the 1960s amphicar and the contemporary gibbs aquada the operation started in 2010 in katendrecht , rotterdam , was copied in amsterdam in 2011 but suspended in 2012 after technical problems , and then relaunched in 2019 some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land the distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water , with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality , rather than being the main function since 1977 , several boat builders in brittany have built specialized amphibious vehicles for use in the area 's mussel and oyster farming industries it was designed as a wartime project by sparkman & stephens , a yacht design firm who also designed the hull for the ford gpa during the vietnam war , the us army used the amphibious articulated gama goat and the larger m520 goer truck-series to move supplies through the canals and paddy field of southeast asia coupled with its amphibious capability , in the vietnam war , the m520 goer developed a reputation of being able to go where other trucks could not for taking vehicles and supplies onto the beaches the us used the 1950s designed larc-v and the huge larc-lx which could carry 60 tons of cargo the british army used the 6x6 wheeled alvis stalwart as their amphibious cargo carrier the m3 amphibious rig can be used as a ferry or as a floating bridge for trucks and heavy combat vehicles gibbs has also developed other types of fast amphibians including the phibian , a amphibian that is aimed at first responder market , and the humdinga , a amphibian that is capable of traversing extreme terrain during the cold war the soviet bloc states developed a number of amphibious apcs , fighting vehicles and tanks , both wheeled and tracked most of the vehicles the soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water some military vehicles are capable of '' wading '' using waterproof screens to keep the upper hull dry for some military applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft clarkson built his '' nissank '' out of a nissan hardbody , the overall design being very similar to the toybota , but now with oil drums as stabilizers

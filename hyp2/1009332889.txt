apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller heavily armoured vehicles however sometimes have a density greater than water ( their weight in kilograms exceeds their volume in litres ) and will need additional buoyancy measures for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages , the invention of which is credited to the neapolitan polymath prince raimondo di sangro of sansevero in july 1770 or earlier , or samuel bentham whose design of 1781 was built in june 1787 inventor gail borden , better known for condensed milk , designed and tested a sail-powered wagon in 1849 on testing , it reportedly tipped over 50 feet ( 15 & nbsp ; m ) from shore , from an apparent lack of ballast to counteract the force of the wind in the sail in the 1870s , logging companies in eastern canada and the northern united states developed a steam-powered amphibious tug called an '' alligator '' which could cross between lakes and rivers in order to get the wheels to provide propulsion in the water , fins or buckets would be attached to the rear wheel spokes in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey the vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells , allowing the vehicles to plane on water these vehicles can transition between land and water modes in about five seconds the watercar can do 80 & nbsp ; mph ( 129 & nbsp ; km/h ) on land , and 44 & nbsp ; mph ( 38 knots ; 71 & nbsp ; km/h ) on sea , and can transition from land to sea in less than 15 seconds an amphibious cycle is a human-powered vehicle capable of operation on both land and water '' saidullah 's bicycle '' uses four rectangular air filled floats for buoyancy , and is propelled using two fan blades which are attached to the spokes the wings on the powered wheels propel the vehicle in a similar way to a paddle wheel the sbk engineering shuttle-bike consists of two inflatable floats with straps that allow the carrying of a bicycle with a passenger amongst the smallest non-air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious atvs ( all-terrain vehicles ) most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines , that will provide roughly 25 & nbsp ; mph ( 40 & nbsp ; km/h ) top speed on land constructed this way , an aatv will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps , ponds , and streams as well as dry land although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during world war ii the amphibious bodywork was designed by erwin komenda , the firm 's body construction designer , using the engine and drive train of the kübelwagen a specially modified gpa , called half-safe , was driven and sailed around the world by australian ben carlin in the 1950s with almost 4,000 pieces built , the amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date the gibbs aquada stands out due to its capability of high-speed planing on water regulatory approval for the aquada the southern california-based company , watercar , founded by dave march , has also built four working amphibious prototypes , one which holds the guinness world record for world 's fastest amphibious vehicle ( the python ) in 2013 , march released the company 's first commercial vehicle , the panther other amphibious cars include the us hydra spyder and the spira4u a similar service , using different vehicles , operates in porto some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land these craft can travel up to 39 knots on water , but travel at only 7.5 & nbsp ; km/hr on land , showing the preference for water performance in design since 1977 , several boat builders in brittany have built specialized amphibious vehicles for use in the area 's mussel and oyster farming industries the british army used the 6x6 wheeled alvis stalwart as their amphibious cargo carrier the vab is a french fully amphibious apc , powered in the water by two water jets , mounted one on either side of the rear hull ( see detail picture above ) the valentine , then the m4 sherman medium tank were made amphibious with the addition of a rubberized canvas screen to provide additional buoyancy and propellers driven by the main engine to give propulsion these were dd tanks ( from '' duplex drive '' ) and the sherman dd was used on d-day to provide close fire support on the beaches during the initial landings some civilian deep wading vehicles achieve their capability by means of legs or stilts to raise the body of the vehicle from its wheels for some military applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft along the way , they attempted to beat richard branson 's world record for crossing the channel in an amphibious vehicle , but failed

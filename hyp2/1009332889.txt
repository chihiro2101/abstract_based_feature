apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not amongst the latter , many designs were prompted by the desire to expand the off-road capabilities of land-vehicles to an '' all-terrain '' ability , in some cases not only focused on creating a transport that will work on land and water , but also on intermediates like ice , snow , mud , marsh , swamp etc most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller heavily armoured vehicles however sometimes have a density greater than water ( their weight in kilograms exceeds their volume in litres ) and will need additional buoyancy measures for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam the single front wheel provided direction , both on land and in the water remarkably the boat-like hull was one of the first integral bodies ever used on a car in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water the vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells , allowing the vehicles to plane on water these vehicles can transition between land and water modes in about five seconds iguana yachts , a france company created in 2008 , has developed amphibious motorboats featuring all-terrain tracks sealegs amphibious craft , a three-wheeled amphibious boat designed in new zealand , has been in production since 2005 since then , the company launched their first commercial vehicle , the panther , which has been featured on abc 's the bachelor as well as usa 's royal pains the watercar can do 80 & nbsp ; mph ( 129 & nbsp ; km/h ) on land , and 44 & nbsp ; mph ( 38 knots ; 71 & nbsp ; km/h ) on sea , and can transition from land to sea in less than 15 seconds an amphibious cycle is a human-powered vehicle capable of operation on both land and water moraga 's '' cyclo amphibious '' uses a simple tricycle frame to support three floaters which provide both the floatation and thrust introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land amongst the smallest non-air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious atvs ( all-terrain vehicles ) although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water 1900 , however the second world war significantly stimulated their development the most proliferous was the german schwimmwagen , a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in world war ii the amphibious bodywork was designed by erwin komenda , the firm 's body construction designer , using the engine and drive train of the kübelwagen an amphibious version of the willys mb jeep , the ford gpa or 'seep ' ( short for sea jeep ) was developed during world war ii as well regulatory approval for the aquada the southern california-based company , watercar , founded by dave march , has also built four working amphibious prototypes , one which holds the guinness world record for world 's fastest amphibious vehicle ( the python ) some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land sealegs amphibious craft are an example of this , which are a range of aluminium fabricated boats ( mostly ribs ) designed and manufactured in auckland , new zealand these craft can travel up to 39 knots on water , but travel at only 7.5 & nbsp ; km/hr on land , showing the preference for water performance in design the latter was based on a 1950s civil construction vehicle and became the us army 's standard heavy tactical truck before its replacement by the hemtt although the vehicles ' wheels were mounted without suspension or steering action , and land speeds over 20 & nbsp ; mph ( 32 & nbsp ; km/h ) were ill-advised , its articulated design provided it with good maneuverability and helped it to keep all four wheels firmly in touch with uneven ground the french panhard vbl is a compact , lightly armored 4x4 all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at during the cold war the soviet bloc states developed a number of amphibious apcs , fighting vehicles and tanks , both wheeled and tracked most of the vehicles the soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water the basic vehicle will float but its bow is square so the additional floats add stability and load carrying capacity soviet examples are the pt-76 amphibious tank , and the btr-50 and mt-lb apcs based on its chassis in some cases the design is made amphibious , giving them all-terrain capability in the truest sense the hovercraft 's ability to distribute its laden weight evenly across the surface below it makes it well suited to the role of amphibious landing craft in the initial tests , the vw had issues on both water and land , the jeep worked well on water but not on land ( the airboat motor left him stranded on the highway ) , and the turboat performed well on land but sank immediately in the water

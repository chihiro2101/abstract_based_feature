apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat some of the earliest known amphibious vehicles were amphibious carriages , the invention of which is credited to the neapolitan polymath prince raimondo di sangro of sansevero in july 1770 or earlier , or samuel bentham whose design of 1781 was built in june 1787 the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam since the 1920s , many diverse amphibious vehicles designs have been created for a broad range of applications , including recreation , expeditions , search & rescue , and military , leading to a myriad of concepts and variants in some of them , the amphibious capabilities are central to their purpose , whereas in others they are only an expansion to what has remained primarily a watercraft or a land vehicle the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water the vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells , allowing the vehicles to plane on water sealegs amphibious craft , a three-wheeled amphibious boat designed in new zealand , has been in production since 2005 since then , the company launched their first commercial vehicle , the panther , which has been featured on abc 's the bachelor as well as usa 's royal pains an amphibious cycle is a human-powered vehicle capable of operation on both land and water introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land the model can reach up to 80 & nbsp ; mph by land and 45 & nbsp ; mph by water amongst the smallest non-air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious atvs ( all-terrain vehicles ) most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines , that will provide roughly 25 & nbsp ; mph ( 40 & nbsp ; km/h ) top speed on land constructed this way , an aatv will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps , ponds , and streams as well as dry land although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water – albeit slowly – outboard motors can be added for extended water use in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water the quadski was developed using gibbs ' high-speed amphibian technology , which gibbs originally developed for the aquada , an amphibious car , which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during world war ii the amphibious bodywork was designed by erwin komenda , the firm 's body construction designer , using the engine and drive train of the kübelwagen one of the most capable post-war amphibious off-roaders was the german amphi-ranger , that featured a hull made of seawater-resistant almg2 aluminium alloy regulatory approval for the aquada the southern california-based company , watercar , founded by dave march , has also built four working amphibious prototypes , one which holds the guinness world record for world 's fastest amphibious vehicle ( the python ) since its release , watercar has been popular in the middle east , selling to the embassy of the united arab emirates , with six additional vehicles being sold to the crown prince of dubai other amphibious cars include the us hydra spyder and the spira4u the operation started in 2010 in katendrecht , rotterdam , was copied in amsterdam in 2011 but suspended in 2012 after technical problems , and then relaunched in 2019 some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land these craft can travel up to 39 knots on water , but travel at only 7.5 & nbsp ; km/hr on land , showing the preference for water performance in design various versions of this type of amphibious boat design have been produced , including the iguana yacht ( covered in the '' tracked '' section below ) the boats are made of aluminium , are relatively flat-bottomed , and have three , four , or six wheels , depending on the size of the boat for taking vehicles and supplies onto the beaches the us used the 1950s designed larc-v and the huge larc-lx which could carry 60 tons of cargo the british army used the 6x6 wheeled alvis stalwart as their amphibious cargo carrier the vab is a french fully amphibious apc , powered in the water by two water jets , mounted one on either side of the rear hull ( see detail picture above ) during the cold war the soviet bloc states developed a number of amphibious apcs , fighting vehicles and tanks , both wheeled and tracked most of the vehicles the soviets designed were amphibious or could ford deep water tracked armored vehicles with amphibious capabilities include those that are intended for use in amphibious assault the united states started developing a long line of lvt ( landing vehicle tracked ) designs from around 1940 at the end of world war i a mark ix tank had drums attached to the side and front and was tested as an amphibious vehicle launched into hendon reservoir for some military applications wheeled and tracked amphibious vehicles are slowly being supplanted by air-cushioned landing craft

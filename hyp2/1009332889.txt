apart from the distinction in sizes mentioned above , two main categories of amphibious vehicles are immediately apparent : those that travel on an air-cushion ( hovercraft ) and those that do not this explains why many designs use tracks in addition to or instead of wheels , and in some cases even resort to articulated body configurations or other unconventional designs such as screw-propelled vehicles which use auger-like barrels which propel a vehicle through muddy terrain with a twisting motion most land vehicles – even lightly armoured ones – can be made amphibious simply by providing them with a waterproof hull and perhaps a propeller heavily armoured vehicles however sometimes have a density greater than water ( their weight in kilograms exceeds their volume in litres ) and will need additional buoyancy measures for propulsion in or on the water some vehicles simply make do by spinning their wheels or tracks , while others can power their way forward more effectively using ( additional ) screw propeller ( s ) or pump-jet most amphibians will work only as a displacement hull when in the water – only a small number of designs have the capability to raise out of the water when speed is gained , to achieve high velocity hydroplaning , skimming over the water surface like motorboat the first known self-propelled amphibious vehicle , a steam-powered wheeled dredging barge , named the orukter amphibolos , was conceived and built by united states inventor oliver evans in 1805 , although it is disputed to have successfully travelled over land or water under its own steam on testing , it reportedly tipped over 50 feet ( 15 & nbsp ; m ) from shore , from an apparent lack of ballast to counteract the force of the wind in the sail in the 1870s , logging companies in eastern canada and the northern united states developed a steam-powered amphibious tug called an '' alligator '' which could cross between lakes and rivers until the late 1920s , the efforts to unify a boat and an automobile mostly came down to simply putting wheels and axles on a boat hull , or getting a rolling chassis to float by blending a boat-like hull with the car 's frame one of the first reasonably well-documented cases was the 1905 amphibious petrol-powered carriage of t since the 1920s , many diverse amphibious vehicles designs have been created for a broad range of applications , including recreation , expeditions , search & rescue , and military , leading to a myriad of concepts and variants the design that came together with all the features needed for a practical all-terrain amphibious vehicle was by peter prell of new jersey his design , unlike others , could operate not only on rivers and lakes but the sea and did not require firm ground to enter or exit the water recently , gibbs amphibians has developed a new type of amphibian , one capable of high speeds on both land and water the vehicles use a patented hydraulic system to raise the wheels into the wheel wells , allowing the vehicles to plane on water sealegs amphibious craft , a three-wheeled amphibious boat designed in new zealand , has been in production since 2005 the watercar can do 80 & nbsp ; mph ( 129 & nbsp ; km/h ) on land , and 44 & nbsp ; mph ( 38 knots ; 71 & nbsp ; km/h ) on sea , and can transition from land to sea in less than 15 seconds the wings on the powered wheels propel the vehicle in a similar way to a paddle wheel several amphibious cycles have been created by engineering students as university projects introduced a motorized version of the amphibious cycle that resembles a jet ski on water and motorcycle on land the model can reach up to 80 & nbsp ; mph by land and 45 & nbsp ; mph by water amongst the smallest non-air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious atvs ( all-terrain vehicles ) on land these units have high grip and great off-road ability , that can be further enhanced with an optional set of tracks that can be mounted directly onto the wheels in october 2013 , gibbs amphibians introduced the long-awaited quadski , the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling 45 & nbsp ; mph on land or water the quadski was developed using gibbs ' high-speed amphibian technology , which gibbs originally developed for the aquada , an amphibious car , which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during world war ii the amphibious bodywork was designed by erwin komenda , the firm 's body construction designer , using the engine and drive train of the kübelwagen only about 100 were built – those who own one have found it capable of crossing the english channel almost effortlessly purely recreational amphibian cars include the 1960s amphicar and the contemporary gibbs aquada with almost 4,000 pieces built , the amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date gibbs built fifty aquadas in the early 2000s after it was developed by a team assembled by founder alan gibbs before the company 's engine supplier , rover , was unable to continue providing engines regulatory approval for the aquada the southern california-based company , watercar , founded by dave march , has also built four working amphibious prototypes , one which holds the guinness world record for world 's fastest amphibious vehicle ( the python ) some amphibious vehicles , rather than being designed for land transport with the ability to cross water , are designed as water-transport vehicles with the ability to travel on land the distinction is that the vehicles are designed to be high performing on water , with the land transport ability added to give additional functionality , rather than being the main function various versions of this type of amphibious boat design have been produced , including the iguana yacht ( covered in the '' tracked '' section below ) since 1977 , several boat builders in brittany have built specialized amphibious vehicles for use in the area 's mussel and oyster farming industries it was designed as a wartime project by sparkman & stephens , a yacht design firm who also designed the hull for the ford gpa tracked armored vehicles with amphibious capabilities include those that are intended for use in amphibious assault some light tanks such as the pt-76 are amphibious , typically being propelled in the water by hydrojets or by their tracks in all cases , the bilge pumps had to be working properly , and even then by the time the sheridan or the apc reached the other side , water would often fill the insides up to their armoured roofs , spilling through the hatches ' cracks and emptying onto the earth once safely ashore one of the benefits of this type of amphibious craft is the possibility of making them large—the british-built sr.n4 mk.3 ferries could carry dozens of vehicles

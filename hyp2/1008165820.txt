jean de la bruyère was born in paris , in today 's essonne département , in 1645 ) his family was middle class , and his reference to a certain '' geoffroy de la bruyère '' , a crusader , is only a satirical illustration of a method of self-ennoblement then common in france , as in some other countries la bruyère could trace his family back on his father 's side at least as far as his great-grandfather , who along with his grandfather had been dedicated members of the catholic league his father was controller general of finance to the hôtel de ville , and despite the turmoil in the country , was able to pay for la bruyère 's education and to leave him a considerable sum as an inheritance his predecessor in the post was a relation of jacques benigne bossuet , and it is thought that the transaction of the change was the cause of la bruyère 's introduction to the great orator , bossuet , who , from the date of his own preceptorship of the dauphin , was a kind of agent-general for tutorships in the royal family , and , in 1684 , who introduced la bruyère to the household of louis , prince of condé ( 1621–1686 ) la bruyère became tutor to the prince 's grandson , louis , as well as to the prince 's child-bride , mlle de nantes , a natural child of louis xiv a curious passage in a letter by boileau to racine exists , however , in which the writer regrets that '' nature has not made la bruyère as agreeable as he would like to be when la bruyère 's caractères appeared in 1688 , nicolas de malézieu predicted at once , that it would bring '' bien des lecteurs et bien des ennemis '' ( many readers and many enemies ) the caractères , a translation of theophrastus , and a few letters mostly addressed to the prince de condé , complete the list of his literary work , with the addition of one curious , and much-disputed , posthumous treatise

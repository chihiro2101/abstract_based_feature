the payment was based on how many papers were in the envelope and how far the letter had traveled this led to his invention of stamp gum in 1837 the world 's first adhesive postage stamp was called the penny black many early stamps were not gummed , however , and some have been unable to be gummed due to shortage ( for instance , the typewritten uganda cowry stamps of 1895 ) some stamps , intended only for sale to stamp collectors , have been issued without gum , for instance the united states farley 's follies souvenir sheets of 1933 on early issues , gum was applied by hand , using a brush or roller , but in 1880 de la rue came up with a machine gumming process using a printing press , and gum is now always applied by machine the gum is universally spread as uniformly as possible on swiss stamps of the 1930s , courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum , resulting in so-called grilled gum the appearance of the gum varies with the type and method of application , and may range from nearly invisible to dark brown globs german stamps from 1921 had a pattern of wavy lines while czech stamps from 1923 had gum showing the initials of the czech republic , csp these patterns have been called gum devices or gum watermarks in recent years , the use of self-adhesive stamps , otherwise known as pressure-sensitive stamps , has become widespread therefore , the stamps can be released easily from the backing and placed onto a postal envelope stamp gum is an item of importance for collectors , although its presence is rarely of use in differentiating between common and rare stamps , and being on the back of the stamp it is not usually visible some stamps have been issued without any gum at all , either due to a lack of materials , or ( in particular in tropical countries ) to avoid the risk of stamp sheets sticking together regummed stamps can not be valued any higher than unused stamps without gum to thematic collectors if the imprint is related to the occasion of the stamp issue , such as on the 1909 hudson-fulton celebration stamps of the united states the gum of older stamp issues often causes the unused stamps to roll in such cases , stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps

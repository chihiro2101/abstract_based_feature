before postage stamps existed , people receiving letters would have to pay for them the payment was based on how many papers were in the envelope and how far the letter had traveled this led to his invention of stamp gum in 1837 the world 's first adhesive postage stamp was called the penny black many early stamps were not gummed , however , and some have been unable to be gummed due to shortage ( for instance , the typewritten uganda cowry stamps of 1895 ) some stamps , intended only for sale to stamp collectors , have been issued without gum , for instance the united states farley 's follies souvenir sheets of 1933 on the first stamps of great britain the gum was called cement williams , l.n and was made from a mixture of potato starch , wheat starch and acacia gum on swiss stamps of the 1930s , courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum , resulting in so-called grilled gum german stamps from 1921 had a pattern of wavy lines while czech stamps from 1923 had gum showing the initials of the czech republic , csp this so-called economy gum ( german : spargummi ) is only applied in patches in recent years , the use of self-adhesive stamps , otherwise known as pressure-sensitive stamps , has become widespread this relatively new form of stamps has a smooth waxed or polymer-coated release carrier backing to which the pressure-adhesive adhesive of the stamp does not adhere as strongly as on paper post office began transitioning from water-based stamps into the use of self-adhesive stamps unused : stamps whose original gum has been damaged , e.g regummed stamps can not be valued any higher than unused stamps without gum dedicated philatelists strive to maintain the integrity of the backing gum , because such stamps are considered more desirable than stamps without their backing gum in 1906 , trouble had constantly arisen due to the gum on the under face of the stamps in such cases , stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps

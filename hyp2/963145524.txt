before postage stamps existed , people receiving letters would have to pay for them the payment was based on how many papers were in the envelope and how far the letter had traveled this led to his invention of stamp gum in 1837 the world 's first adhesive postage stamp was called the penny black some stamps , intended only for sale to stamp collectors , have been issued without gum , for instance the united states farley 's follies souvenir sheets of 1933 on the first stamps of great britain the gum was called cement williams , l.n and was made from a mixture of potato starch , wheat starch and acacia gum there have been a couple of historical instances where stamps were regummed after being perforated , but these were unusual situations on swiss stamps of the 1930s , courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum , resulting in so-called grilled gum another scheme has been to slice the gum with knives after it has been applied in some cases the gum solves the problem itself by becoming '' crackly '' when it dries german stamps from 1921 had a pattern of wavy lines while czech stamps from 1923 had gum showing the initials of the czech republic , csp these patterns have been called gum devices or gum watermarks this so-called economy gum ( german : spargummi ) is only applied in patches unused without gum : stamps which have lost their original gum hence some experts claim that very few unused stamps from the 19th century have not been hinged at some point in their existence the removal of any paper residue that has collected on the gum without removing the gum itself paper damage through stamp gum in such cases , stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps

before postage stamps existed , people receiving letters would have to pay for them many early stamps were not gummed , however , and some have been unable to be gummed due to shortage ( for instance , the typewritten uganda cowry stamps of 1895 ) some stamps , intended only for sale to stamp collectors , have been issued without gum , for instance the united states farley 's follies souvenir sheets of 1933 on the first stamps of great britain the gum was called cement williams , l.n on swiss stamps of the 1930s , courvoisier used a gum-breaking machine that pressed a pattern of small squares into the gum , resulting in so-called grilled gum another scheme has been to slice the gum with knives after it has been applied german stamps from 1921 had a pattern of wavy lines while czech stamps from 1923 had gum showing the initials of the czech republic , csp these patterns have been called gum devices or gum watermarks this so-called economy gum ( german : spargummi ) is only applied in patches in recent years , the use of self-adhesive stamps , otherwise known as pressure-sensitive stamps , has become widespread this relatively new form of stamps has a smooth waxed or polymer-coated release carrier backing to which the pressure-adhesive adhesive of the stamp does not adhere as strongly as on paper therefore , the stamps can be released easily from the backing and placed onto a postal envelope and the united states tried it later on a 1974 christmas stamp ; this was judged a failure and was not reintroduced until 1989 when it gradually became widespread traditionally , in particular before world war ii , stamps were mounted in albums with stamp hinges no matter whether they were used or unused the removal of any paper residue that has collected on the gum without removing the gum itself to thematic collectors if the imprint is related to the occasion of the stamp issue , such as on the 1909 hudson-fulton celebration stamps of the united states paper damage through stamp gum such breaks can also affect the stamp paper and cause the stamps to disintegrate in such cases , stamp catalogs recommend to remove the gum to avoid further damage to the stamps

the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere by this method hf radio waves can travel beyond the horizon , around the curve of the earth , and can be received at intercontinental distances this means that at longer distances , where the waves graze the ionosphere at a very blunt angle , the muf may be much higher this absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity ( for example in daylight ) ; total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 & nbsp ; mhz during the daytime the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range when a transcontinental or worldwide path is open on a particular frequency , digital , ssb and morse code communication is possible using surprisingly low transmission powers , often of the order of milliwatts , provided suitable antennas are in use at both ends and that there is little or no man-made or natural interference however , the development of automatic link establishment technology based on mil-std-188-141 for automated connectivity and frequency selection , along with the high costs of satellite usage , have led to a renaissance in hf usage in government networks some modes of communication , such as continuous wave morse code transmissions ( especially by amateur radio operators ) and single sideband voice transmissions are more common in the hf range than on other frequencies , because of their bandwidth-conserving nature , but broadband modes , such as tv transmissions , are generally prohibited by hf 's relatively small chunk of electromagnetic spectrum space in recent years , concerns have risen among certain users of the hf spectrum over '' broadband over power lines '' ( bpl ) internet access , which has an almost destructive effect on hf communications high frequency active auroral research program high frequency internet protocol radio propagation space weather critical frequency

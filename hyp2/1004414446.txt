the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere the lowest usable frequency depends on the absorption in the lower layer of the ionosphere ( the d-layer ) this absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity ( for example in daylight ) ; total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 & nbsp ; mhz during the daytime the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range the development of higher speed modems such as those conforming to mil-std-188-110c which support data rates up to 120 kilobit/s has also increased the usability of hf for data communications and video transmission in recent years , concerns have risen among certain users of the hf spectrum over '' broadband over power lines '' ( bpl ) internet access , which has an almost destructive effect on hf communications this is due to the frequencies on which bpl operates ( typically corresponding with the hf band ) and the tendency for the bpl signal to leak from power lines the most common antennas in this band are wire antennas such as wire dipoles and the rhombic antenna ; in the upper frequencies , multielement dipole antennas such as the yagi , quad , and log-periodic antennas high frequency active auroral research program high frequency internet protocol radio propagation space weather critical frequency '' high frequency noise '' ( pdf ) '' advantages of hf radio '' codan solar conditions for hf-radio

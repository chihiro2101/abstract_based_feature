the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere by this method hf radio waves can travel beyond the horizon , around the curve of the earth , and can be received at intercontinental distances it depends on the angle of incidence of the waves ; it is lowest when the waves are directed straight upwards , and is higher with less acute angles this absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity ( for example in daylight ) ; total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 & nbsp ; mhz during the daytime the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range at worst , when a band is '' dead '' , no communication beyond the limited groundwave paths is possible no matter what powers , antennas or other technologies are brought to bear in recent years , concerns have risen among certain users of the hf spectrum over '' broadband over power lines '' ( bpl ) internet access , which has an almost destructive effect on hf communications these include cb radios around 27 & nbsp ; mhz , studio-to-transmitter ( stl ) radio links , radio control devices for models and radio paging transmitters high frequency active auroral research program high frequency internet protocol radio propagation space weather critical frequency '' high frequency noise '' ( pdf ) '' advantages of hf radio '' codan solar conditions for hf-radio

the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere by this method hf radio waves can travel beyond the horizon , around the curve of the earth , and can be received at intercontinental distances this absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity ( for example in daylight ) ; total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 & nbsp ; mhz during the daytime the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range when a transcontinental or worldwide path is open on a particular frequency , digital , ssb and morse code communication is possible using surprisingly low transmission powers , often of the order of milliwatts , provided suitable antennas are in use at both ends and that there is little or no man-made or natural interference international shortwave broadcasting utilizes this set of frequencies , as well as a seemingly declining number of '' utility '' users ( marine , aviation , military , and diplomatic interests ) , who have , in recent years , been swayed over to less volatile means of communication ( for example , via satellites ) , but may maintain hf stations after switch-over for back-up purposes however , the development of automatic link establishment technology based on mil-std-188-141 for automated connectivity and frequency selection , along with the high costs of satellite usage , have led to a renaissance in hf usage in government networks for frequencies in the upper hf band , the ground is a better reflector of horizontally polarized waves , and better absorber of power from vertically polarized waves long-distance ( skywave ) receiving antennas can generally be oriented either vertically or horizontally since refraction through the ionosphere usually scrambles signal polarization , and signals are received directly from the sky to the antenna '' high frequency noise '' ( pdf ) '' advantages of hf radio '' codan solar conditions for hf-radio

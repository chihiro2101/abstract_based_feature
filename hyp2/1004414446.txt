the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere by this method hf radio waves can travel beyond the horizon , around the curve of the earth , and can be received at intercontinental distances the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range at worst , when a band is '' dead '' , no communication beyond the limited groundwave paths is possible no matter what powers , antennas or other technologies are brought to bear some bpl providers have installed notch filters to block out certain portions of the spectrum ( namely the amateur radio bands ) , but a great amount of controversy over the deployment of this access method remains these include cb radios around 27 & nbsp ; mhz , studio-to-transmitter ( stl ) radio links , radio control devices for models and radio paging transmitters the most common antennas in this band are wire antennas such as wire dipoles and the rhombic antenna ; in the upper frequencies , multielement dipole antennas such as the yagi , quad , and log-periodic antennas for frequencies in the upper hf band , the ground is a better reflector of horizontally polarized waves , and better absorber of power from vertically polarized waves high frequency active auroral research program high frequency internet protocol radio propagation space weather critical frequency '' high frequency noise '' ( pdf ) '' advantages of hf radio '' codan solar conditions for hf-radio

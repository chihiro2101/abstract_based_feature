the dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave ( '' skip '' ) propagation , in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere by this method hf radio waves can travel beyond the horizon , around the curve of the earth , and can be received at intercontinental distances this absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity ( for example in daylight ) ; total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 & nbsp ; mhz during the daytime the result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the medium frequency ( mf ) range during winter nights , while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable , often into the lower vhf range at worst , when a band is '' dead '' , no communication beyond the limited groundwave paths is possible no matter what powers , antennas or other technologies are brought to bear international shortwave broadcasting utilizes this set of frequencies , as well as a seemingly declining number of '' utility '' users ( marine , aviation , military , and diplomatic interests ) , who have , in recent years , been swayed over to less volatile means of communication ( for example , via satellites ) , but may maintain hf stations after switch-over for back-up purposes some bpl providers have installed notch filters to block out certain portions of the spectrum ( namely the amateur radio bands ) , but a great amount of controversy over the deployment of this access method remains these include cb radios around 27 & nbsp ; mhz , studio-to-transmitter ( stl ) radio links , radio control devices for models and radio paging transmitters for frequencies in the upper hf band , the ground is a better reflector of horizontally polarized waves , and better absorber of power from vertically polarized waves high frequency active auroral research program high frequency internet protocol radio propagation space weather critical frequency

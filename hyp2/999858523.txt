combining a solution of many magnesium salts with alkaline water induces precipitate of solid mg ( oh ) 2 : : mg 2+ + 2 oh − → mg ( oh ) 2 on a commercial scale , mg ( oh ) 2 is produced by treating seawater with lime ( ca ( oh ) 2 ) ca ( oh ) 2 is far more soluble than mg ( oh ) 2 , so the latter precipitates as a solid : : mgo + h2o - > mg ( oh ) 2 most mg ( oh ) 2 that is produced industrially , as well as the small amount that is mined , is converted to fused magnesia ( mgo ) magnesium hydroxide is used in suspension as either an antacid or a laxative , depending on concentration some sources claim that the hydroxide ions themselves do not play a significant role in the laxative effects of milk of magnesia , as basic solutions ( i.e only a small amount of the magnesium from magnesium hydroxide is usually absorbed by the intestine ( unless one is deficient in magnesium ) however , magnesium is mainly excreted by the kidneys so long-term , daily consumption of milk of magnesia by someone suffering from kidney failure could lead in theory to hypermagnesemia 1788 to 1871 , 24 february 2005 the term milk of magnesia was first used by charles henry phillips in 1872 for a suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8 % w/v in the uk , the non-brand ( generic ) name of '' milk of magnesia '' and '' phillips ' milk of magnesia '' is '' cream of magnesia '' ( magnesium hydroxide mixture , bp ) natural magnesium hydroxide ( brucite ) is used commercially as a fire retardant like aluminium hydroxide , solid magnesium hydroxide has smoke suppressing and flame retardant properties : mgco 3 + 2 naoh → mg ( oh ) 2 + na 2 co 3 this reaction , one of the two main alkali–aggregate reaction ( aar ) is also known as alkali–carbonate reaction

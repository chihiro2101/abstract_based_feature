calmodulin is a small , highly conserved protein that is 148 amino acids long ( 16.7 kda ) calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin c , another ca 2+ -binding protein containing four ef-hand motifs it therefore does not exhibit the same diversity of target recognition as does calmodulin calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility in addition to the flexibility of the central linker domain , the n- and c-domains undergo open-closed conformational cycling in the ca 2+ -bound state calmodulin also exhibits great structural variability , and undergoes considerable conformational fluctuations , when bound to targets moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences the flexible central domain of calmodulin allows the protein to wrap around its target , although alternate modes of binding are known “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels calmodulin mediates many crucial processes such as inflammation , metabolism , apoptosis , smooth muscle contraction , intracellular movement , short-term and long-term memory , and the immune response calmodulin is expressed in many cell types and can have different subcellular locations , including the cytoplasm , within organelles , or associated with the plasma or organelle membranes , but it is always found intracellularly many of the proteins that calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves , and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase another way that calmodulin affects muscle contraction is by controlling the movement of ca 2+ across both the cell and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes the calcium channels , such as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum , can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium , thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell this is a very important function of calmodulin because it indirectly plays a role in every physiological process that is affected by smooth muscle contraction such as digestion and contraction of arteries ( which helps distribute blood and regulate blood pressure ) the atbag6 protein is a cam-binding protein that binds to cam only in the absence of ca 2+ and not in the presence of it its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of ca 2+

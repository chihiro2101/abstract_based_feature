calmodulin is a small , highly conserved protein that is 148 amino acids long ( 16.7 kda ) calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin c , another ca 2+ -binding protein containing four ef-hand motifs however , troponin c contains an additional alpha-helix at its n-terminus , and is constitutively bound to its target , troponin i it therefore does not exhibit the same diversity of target recognition as does calmodulin calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility in addition to the flexibility of the central linker domain , the n- and c-domains undergo open-closed conformational cycling in the ca 2+ -bound state moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences together , these features allow calmodulin to recognize some 300 target proteins exhibiting a variety of cam-binding sequence motifs the flexible central domain of calmodulin allows the protein to wrap around its target , although alternate modes of binding are known “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels many of the proteins that calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves , and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer calmodulin can also make use of the calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum , and the sarcoplasmic reticulum this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase another way that calmodulin affects muscle contraction is by controlling the movement of ca 2+ across both the cell and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes the calcium channels , such as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum , can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium , thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell different root cell types show a different ca 2+ response to osmotic and salt stresses and this implies the cellular specificities of ca 2+ patterns its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of ca 2+ calmodulin belongs to one of the two main groups of calcium-binding proteins , called ef hand proteins

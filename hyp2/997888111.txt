calmodulin is a small , highly conserved protein that is 148 amino acids long ( 16.7 kda ) calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin c , another ca 2+ -binding protein containing four ef-hand motifs calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences together , these features allow calmodulin to recognize some 300 target proteins exhibiting a variety of cam-binding sequence motifs “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels many of the proteins that calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves , and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer calmodulin plays an important role in excitation contraction coupling and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle , ultimately causing smooth muscle contraction this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase another way that calmodulin affects muscle contraction is by controlling the movement of ca 2+ across both the cell and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes calmodulin plays an important role in the activation of phosphorylase kinase , which ultimately leads to glucose being cleaved from glycogen by glycogen phosphorylase calmodulin also plays an important role in lipid metabolism by affecting calcitonin the actions of calcitonin can be blocked by inhibiting the actions of calmodulin , suggesting that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the activation of calcitonin there is a ca 2+ flux at the tip of the root hair initially followed by repetitive oscillation of ca 2+ in the cytosol and also ca 2+ spike occurs around the nucleus the cml43 from the apr134 also binds to ca 2+ ions in vitro which shows that cml43 and apr134 are , hence , involved in the ca 2+ -dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens the atbag6 protein is a cam-binding protein that binds to cam only in the absence of ca 2+ and not in the presence of it its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of ca 2+ many other proteins bind calcium , although binding calcium may not be considered their principal function in the cell .

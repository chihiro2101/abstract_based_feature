calmodulin is a small , highly conserved protein that is 148 amino acids long ( 16.7 kda ) the c-domain has a higher binding affinity for ca 2+ than the n-domain calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin c , another ca 2+ -binding protein containing four ef-hand motifs in addition to the flexibility of the central linker domain , the n- and c-domains undergo open-closed conformational cycling in the ca 2+ -bound state moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences together , these features allow calmodulin to recognize some 300 target proteins exhibiting a variety of cam-binding sequence motifs binding of ca 2+ by the ef-hands causes an opening of the n- and c-domains , which exposes hydrophobic target-binding surfaces the flexible central domain of calmodulin allows the protein to wrap around its target , although alternate modes of binding are known “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels calmodulin is expressed in many cell types and can have different subcellular locations , including the cytoplasm , within organelles , or associated with the plasma or organelle membranes , but it is always found intracellularly calmodulin can undergo post-translational modifications , such as phosphorylation , acetylation , methylation and proteolytic cleavage , each of which has potential to modulate its actions this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase calmodulin also plays an important role in lipid metabolism by affecting calcitonin calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone that lowers blood ca 2+ levels and activates g protein cascades that leads to the generation of camp the actions of calcitonin can be blocked by inhibiting the actions of calmodulin , suggesting that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the activation of calcitonin plants contain cam-related proteins ( cmls ) apart from the typical cam proteins the atbag6 protein is a cam-binding protein that binds to cam only in the absence of ca 2+ and not in the presence of it its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of ca 2+

calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin c , another ca 2+ -binding protein containing four ef-hand motifs calmodulin ’ s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility calmodulin also exhibits great structural variability , and undergoes considerable conformational fluctuations , when bound to targets moreover , the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences “ canonical ” targets of calmodulin , such as myosin light-chain kinases and camkii , bind only to the ca 2+ -bound protein , whereas some proteins , such as nav channels and iq-motif proteins , also bind to calmodulin in the absence of ca 2+ binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via “ mutually induced fit ” , leading to changes in the target protein ’ s function calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity , making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric ( single-chain ) cooperative-binding protein furthermore , target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward ca 2+ ions , which allows for complex allosteric interplay between ca 2+ and target binding interactions this influence of target binding on ca 2+ affinity is believed to allow for ca 2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin , such as small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium ( sk ) channels calmodulin mediates many crucial processes such as inflammation , metabolism , apoptosis , smooth muscle contraction , intracellular movement , short-term and long-term memory , and the immune response it does this by binding various targets in the cell including a large number of enzymes , ion channels , aquaporins and other proteins many of the proteins that calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves , and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer calmodulin plays an important role in excitation contraction coupling and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle , ultimately causing smooth muscle contraction this mlc kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium , thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium , through the binding of calmodulin and activation of mlc kinase another way that calmodulin affects muscle contraction is by controlling the movement of ca 2+ across both the cell and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes this is a very important function of calmodulin because it indirectly plays a role in every physiological process that is affected by smooth muscle contraction such as digestion and contraction of arteries ( which helps distribute blood and regulate blood pressure ) calmodulin plays an important role in the activation of phosphorylase kinase , which ultimately leads to glucose being cleaved from glycogen by glycogen phosphorylase arabidopsis thaliana contains about 50 different cml genes which leads to the question of what purpose these diverse ranges of proteins serve in the cellular function cam binding proteins are also known to regulate reproductive development in plants the cml43 from the apr134 also binds to ca 2+ ions in vitro which shows that cml43 and apr134 are , hence , involved in the ca 2+ -dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens different root cell types show a different ca 2+ response to osmotic and salt stresses and this implies the cellular specificities of ca 2+ patterns many other proteins bind calcium , although binding calcium may not be considered their principal function in the cell .

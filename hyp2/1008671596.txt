the who has proposed a criterion for diagnosis and classification of mds that may apply to most cases however , occasional cases are difficult to classify into defined categories because of one or more unusual features : rare cases with less than 5 % blast will present with auer rods occasionally , cases of mds present with isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia without anemia and with dysplastic changes confined to the single lineage a diagnosis of mds in patients with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia without anemia should be made with caution the goals of therapy are to control symptoms , improve quality of life , improve overall survival , and decrease progression to aml the evidence is very uncertain about the therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stromal cells to treat graft-versus-host diseases after a stem cell transplantation on the all-cause mortality and complete disappear of chronic acute graft-versus-host diseases physical exercises in addition to the standard treatment for adult patients with haematological malignancies may result in little to no difference in the mortality , in the quality of life and in the physical functioning iron overload can develop in mds as a result of the rbc transfusions , which are a major part of the supportive care for anemic mds patients patients requiring relatively large numbers of rbc transfusions can experience the adverse effect of chronic iron overload on their liver , heart , and endocrine functions the resulting organ dysfunction from transfusional iron overload might be a contributor to increased illness and death in early-stage mds clinical trials in the mds are ongoing with iron chelating agents to address the question of whether iron chelation alters the natural history of patients with mds who are transfusion dependent reversal of some of the consequences of iron overload in mds by iron chelation therapy have been shown.both the mds foundation and the national comprehensive cancer network mds guidelines panel have recommended that chelation therapy be considered to decrease iron overload in selected mds patients stem-cell transplantation offers possible cure , with survival rates of 50 % at 3 years , although older patients do poorly the number of new cases each year is probably increasing as the average age of the population increases , and some authors propose that the number of new cases in those over 70 may be as high as 15 per 100,000 per year

thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal the formats of other varieties of smpte timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode more complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings ) , atsc , pal-m ( brazil ) ) 30 frame/sec ( atsc ) in general , smpte timecode frame rate information is implicit , known from the rate of arrival of the timecode from the medium the interpretation of several bits , including the color framing and drop frame bits , depends on the underlying data rate in particular , the drop frame bit is only valid for a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s with a 30 & nbsp ; hz frame rate the line scan frequency is ( 30 & nbsp ; Ã— 525 ) & nbsp ; 15750 & nbsp ; hz this causes timecode to skip 18 frames each ten minutes ( 18,000 & nbsp ; frames & nbsp ; 30 & nbsp ; frame/s ) and almost perfectly compensates for the difference in rate longitudinal smpte timecode is widely used to synchronize music vertical interval timecode , ( vitc , pronounced '' vit-see '' ) : recorded into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal on each frame of video control track longitudinal timecode ( ctl timecode ) : smpte timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape technical introduction to timecode by charles poynton article on timecode by chris pirazzi synchronisation and smpte timecodes

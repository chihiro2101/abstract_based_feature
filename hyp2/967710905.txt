thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal the formats of other varieties of smpte timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode more complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings sub-second timecode time values are expressed in terms of frames ) , atsc , pal-m ( brazil ) ) 30 frame/sec ( atsc ) in general , smpte timecode frame rate information is implicit , known from the rate of arrival of the timecode from the medium in particular , the drop frame bit is only valid for a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s drop-frame timecode originates from a compromise introduced when color ntsc video was invented with a 30 & nbsp ; hz frame rate the line scan frequency is ( 30 & nbsp ; × 525 ) & nbsp ; 15750 & nbsp ; hz so the subcarrier frequency would have been & nbsp ; × 15750 & nbsp ; 3.898125 & nbsp ; mhz longitudinal smpte timecode is widely used to synchronize music control track longitudinal timecode ( ctl timecode ) : smpte timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape burnt-in timecode field dominance irig timecode linear timecode midi timecode rewritable consumer timecode vertical interval timecode

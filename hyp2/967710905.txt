thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal the formats of other varieties of smpte timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode more complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings sub-second timecode time values are expressed in terms of frames in particular , the drop frame bit is only valid for a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s after making a series of recordings , or after crude editing , recorded timecodes may consist of discontinuous segments practical systems watch the ascending sequence of the timecode and infer the time of the current frame from that drop-frame timecode originates from a compromise introduced when color ntsc video was invented to correct this , drop-frame smpte timecode was invented aes-ebu embedded timecode , smpte timecode embedded in an aes3 digital audio connection control track longitudinal timecode ( ctl timecode ) : smpte timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape technical introduction to timecode by charles poynton article on timecode by chris pirazzi synchronisation and smpte timecodes

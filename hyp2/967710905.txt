thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal the formats of other varieties of smpte timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode more complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings ) , atsc , pal-m ( brazil ) ) 30 frame/sec ( atsc ) in general , smpte timecode frame rate information is implicit , known from the rate of arrival of the timecode from the medium in particular , the drop frame bit is only valid for a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s in general , it is not possible to know the linear timecode ( ltc ) of the current frame until the frame has already gone by , by which time it is too late to make an edit to minimize subcarrier visibility on a monochrome receiver it was necessary to make the color subcarrier an odd multiple of half the line scan frequency ; the multiple originally chosen was 495 with a 30 & nbsp ; hz frame rate the line scan frequency is ( 30 & nbsp ; × 525 ) & nbsp ; 15750 & nbsp ; hz so the subcarrier frequency would have been & nbsp ; × 15750 & nbsp ; 3.898125 & nbsp ; mhz this was the subcarrier frequency originally chosen , but tests showed that on some monochrome receivers an interference pattern caused by the beat between the color subcarrier and the 4.5 & nbsp ; mhz sound intercarrier could be seen vertical interval timecode , ( vitc , pronounced '' vit-see '' ) : recorded into the vertical blanking interval of the video signal on each frame of video burnt-in timecode field dominance irig timecode linear timecode midi timecode rewritable consumer timecode vertical interval timecode

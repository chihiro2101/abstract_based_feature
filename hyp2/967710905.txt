thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal there are also drop-frame and color framing flags and three extra binary group flag bits used for defining the use of the user bits the formats of other varieties of smpte timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode more complex timecodes such as vertical interval timecode can also include extra information in a variety of encodings in particular , the drop frame bit is only valid for a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s in general , it is not possible to know the linear timecode ( ltc ) of the current frame until the frame has already gone by , by which time it is too late to make an edit with a 30 & nbsp ; hz frame rate the line scan frequency is ( 30 & nbsp ; × 525 ) & nbsp ; 15750 & nbsp ; hz so the subcarrier frequency would have been & nbsp ; × 15750 & nbsp ; 3.898125 & nbsp ; mhz thus the ntsc color subcarrier ended up as 3.57954545 & nbsp ; mhz ( exactly & nbsp ; mhz ) , the line scan frequency as 15734.27 & nbsp ; hz ( exactly & nbsp ; mhz ) and the frame rate 29.97 & nbsp ; hz ( exactly & nbsp ; hz ) this causes timecode to skip 18 frames each ten minutes ( 18,000 & nbsp ; frames & nbsp ; 30 & nbsp ; frame/s ) and almost perfectly compensates for the difference in rate for example , the sequence when frame counts are dropped : :01:08:59:28 :01:08:59:29 :01:09:00:02 :01:09:00:03 for each tenth minute :01:09:59:28 :01:09:59:29 :01:10:00:00 :01:10:00:01 while non-drop timecode is displayed with colons separating the digit pairs— '' hh : mm : ss : ff '' —drop-frame is usually represented with a semicolon ( ; ) or period ( burnt-in timecode field dominance irig timecode linear timecode midi timecode rewritable consumer timecode vertical interval timecode

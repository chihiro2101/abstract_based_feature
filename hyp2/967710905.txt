thumb smpte timecode is presented in hour : minute : second : frame format and is typically represented in 32 bits using binary coded decimal the formats of other varieties of smpte timecode are derived from that of the linear timecode ) , atsc , pal-m ( brazil ) ) 30 frame/sec ( atsc ) in general , smpte timecode frame rate information is implicit , known from the rate of arrival of the timecode from the medium in particular , the drop frame bit is only valid for a nominal frame rate of 30 & nbsp ; frame/s after making a series of recordings , or after crude editing , recorded timecodes may consist of discontinuous segments thus , a boundary between discontinuous timecode ranges can not be determined exactly until several subsequent frames have passed with a 30 & nbsp ; hz frame rate the line scan frequency is ( 30 & nbsp ; Ã— 525 ) & nbsp ; 15750 & nbsp ; hz to correct this , drop-frame smpte timecode was invented this causes timecode to skip 18 frames each ten minutes ( 18,000 & nbsp ; frames & nbsp ; 30 & nbsp ; frame/s ) and almost perfectly compensates for the difference in rate longitudinal smpte timecode is widely used to synchronize music control track longitudinal timecode ( ctl timecode ) : smpte timecode embedded in the control track of a video tape burnt-in timecode field dominance irig timecode linear timecode midi timecode rewritable consumer timecode vertical interval timecode

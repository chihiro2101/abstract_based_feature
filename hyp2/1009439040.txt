paddy-based rice farming has been practised in korea since ancient times a pit-house at the daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period ( c british agricultural revolution saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output by the early 19th century , agricultural techniques , implements , seed stocks , and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages mechanical harvesters ( combines ) , planters , transplanters , and other equipment were then developed , further revolutionizing agriculture these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields ( ebook } the discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition , in the first two decades of the 20th century , led to vitamin supplements , which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors , reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements following world war ii synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system , more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and under-productive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems these synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage , improved feed and fattening rates , increased soil fertility and quality , intensified nutrient cycle , integrated pest control , and improved biodiversity the introduction of certain legume crops to pastures increases carbon accumulation and nitrogen fixation in soils , while their digestibility helps animal fattening and reduces methane emissions from enteric fermentation iclf systems yield beef cattle productivity up to ten times that of degraded pastures , additional crop production from maize , sorghum , and soybean harvests , and greatly reduced greenhouse gas balances due to forest carbon sequestration in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production , developed by the usda-sare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves , rebuild shoot systems , and deepen root systems , resulting in long-term maximum biomass production with the increased productivity of rotational systems , the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems intensive livestock farming or '' factory farming '' , is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density sources discussing '' intensive farming '' , '' intensive agriculture '' or '' factory farming '' : fraser , david '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet in a year which has been as uneventful on the

intensive livestock operations '' , can hold large numbers ( some up to hundreds of thousands ) of cows , hogs , turkeys , or chickens , often indoors food and water is delivered to the animals , and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents , vitamin supplements , and growth hormones are often employed it gives an environment favourable to the strain of rice being grown , and is hostile to many

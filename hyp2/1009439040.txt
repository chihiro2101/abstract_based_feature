this in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth , freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce , and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution agricultural revolution in england 1500–1850 ( september 19 , 2002 ) , bbc industrial agriculture arose in the industrial revolution in 1892 , the first gasoline engine tractor was successfully developed , and in 1923 , the international harvester farmall tractor became the first all-purpose tractor , marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture , due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction , soil erosion , and declines in overall soil fertility , along with health concerns about toxic chemicals food chain following world war ii synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems this degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased fertility and water availability and increased rates of erosion , compaction , and acidification management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated crop-livestock ( icl ) and crop-livestock-forestry ( iclf ) systems , which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework the introduction of certain legume crops to pastures increases carbon accumulation and nitrogen fixation in soils , while their digestibility helps animal fattening and reduces methane emissions from enteric fermentation in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production , developed by the usda-sare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth the herds graze one portion of pasture , or a paddock , while allowing the others to recover resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves , rebuild shoot systems , and deepen root systems , resulting in long-term maximum biomass production pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements , but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems with the increased productivity of rotational systems , the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems sources discussing '' intensive farming '' , '' intensive agriculture '' or '' factory farming '' : fraser , david '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet the intensive systems—called 'factory farms ' —were characterised by confinement of the animals at high stocking density , often in barren and unnatural conditions why the organic revolution had to happen , the observer , april 21 , 2001 : '' nor is a return to 'primitive ' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture '' factory farms – the only answer to our growing appetite ?

paddy-based rice farming has been practised in korea since ancient times a pit-house at the daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period ( c british agricultural revolution saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output this in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth , freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce , and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution historians cited enclosure , mechanization , four-field crop rotation , and selective breeding as the most important innovations the first industrial woman ( new york : oxford university press , 1995 ) , p industrial agriculture arose in the industrial revolution by the early 19th century , agricultural techniques , implements , seed stocks , and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages mechanical harvesters ( combines ) , planters , transplanters , and other equipment were then developed , further revolutionizing agriculture these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields following world war ii synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation this degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased fertility and water availability and increased rates of erosion , compaction , and acidification degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated crop-livestock ( icl ) and crop-livestock-forestry ( iclf ) systems , which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth the herds graze one portion of pasture , or a paddock , while allowing the others to recover pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements , but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems with the increased productivity of rotational systems , the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems intensive livestock farming or '' factory farming '' , is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density sources discussing '' intensive farming '' , '' intensive agriculture '' or '' factory farming '' : fraser , david animal welfare and the intensification of animal production : an alternative interpretation , food and agriculture organization of the united nations , 2005 why the organic revolution had to happen , the observer , april 21 , 2001 : '' nor is a return to 'primitive ' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture '' factory farms â€“ the only answer to our growing appetite ?

paddy-based rice farming has been practised in korea since ancient times a pit-house at the daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period ( c historians cited enclosure , mechanization , four-field crop rotation , and selective breeding as the most important innovations industrial agriculture arose in the industrial revolution by the early 19th century , agricultural techniques , implements , seed stocks , and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made long-distance distribution feasible integrated pest management is the modern method to minimize pesticide use to more sustainable levels there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated crop-livestock ( icl ) and crop-livestock-forestry ( iclf ) systems , which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework these synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage , improved feed and fattening rates , increased soil fertility and quality , intensified nutrient cycle , integrated pest control , and improved biodiversity in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production , developed by the usda-sare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth it can be used with cattle , sheep , goats , pigs , chickens , turkeys , ducks , and other animals pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements , but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems with the increased productivity of rotational systems , the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems sources discussing '' intensive farming '' , '' intensive agriculture '' or '' factory farming '' : fraser , david animal welfare and the intensification of animal production : an alternative interpretation , food and agriculture organization of the united nations , 2005 '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet the intensive systems—called 'factory farms ' —were characterised by confinement of the animals at high stocking density , often in barren and unnatural conditions why the organic revolution had to happen , the observer , april 21 , 2001 : '' nor is a return to 'primitive ' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture in a year which has been as uneventful on the husbandry side as it has been significant in economic and political developments touching the future of food procurement , the more far-seeing would name the growth of intensive farming as the major development this must be the way forward and we should end industrial agriculture in this country as well permitted substances for the production of organic foods '' , food and agriculture organization of the united nations : '' 'factory ' farming refers to industrial management systems that are heavily reliant on veterinary and feed inputs not permitted in organic agriculture this must be the way forward and we should end industrial agriculture in this country as well '' concentrated animal feeding operations '' ( cafo ) , or '' intensive livestock operations '' , can hold large numbers ( some up to hundreds of thousands ) of cows , hogs , turkeys , or chickens , often indoors cafos have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide , both in terms of total food produced and efficiency food and water is delivered to the animals , and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents , vitamin supplements , and growth hormones are often employed crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped intensive farming practices which are thought to be sustainable have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services an integrated farming system is a progressive , sustainable agriculture system such as zero waste agriculture or integrated multi-trophic aquaculture , which involves the interactions of multiple species union of concerned

paddy-based rice farming has been practised in korea since ancient times british agricultural revolution saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output historians cited enclosure , mechanization , four-field crop rotation , and selective breeding as the most important innovations the first industrial woman ( new york : oxford university press , 1995 ) , p industrial agriculture arose in the industrial revolution by the early 19th century , agricultural techniques , implements , seed stocks , and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages mechanical harvesters ( combines ) , planters , transplanters , and other equipment were then developed , further revolutionizing agriculture the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields integrated pest management is the modern method to minimize pesticide use to more sustainable levels there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production , developed by the usda-sare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh , rested grazing areas ( sometimes called paddocks ) to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves , rebuild shoot systems , and deepen root systems , resulting in long-term maximum biomass production pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements , but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems parasites are also left behind to die off , minimizing or eliminating the need for de-wormers intensive livestock farming or '' factory farming '' , is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density sources discussing '' intensive farming '' , '' intensive agriculture '' or '' factory farming '' : fraser , david '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet the intensive systems—called 'factory farms ' —were characterised by confinement of the animals at high stocking density , often in barren and unnatural conditions in the wake of the spread of bse from the uk to the continent of europe , the german government has appointed an agriculture minister from the green party '' sources discussing '' industrial farming '' , '' industrial agriculture '' and '' factory farming '' : '' annex 2 permitted substances for the production of organic foods '' , food and agriculture organization of the united nations : '' 'factory ' farming refers to industrial management systems that are heavily reliant on veterinary and feed inputs not permitted in organic agriculture '' head to head : intensive farming '' , bbc news , march 6 , 2001 : '' here , green mep caroline lucas takes issue with the intensive farming methods of recent decades in the wake of the spread of bse from the uk to the continent of europe , the german government has appointed an agriculture minister from the green party '' eu tackles bse crisis '' , bbc news , november 29 , 2000 '' is factory farming really cheaper ? '' in new scientist , institution of electrical engineers , new science publications , university of michigan , 1971 , p since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge ( fall over ) before harvest , semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes heterosis is utilized in many important crops to greatly increase yields for farmers crop rotation also seeks to balance the nutrient demands of various crops to avoid soil nutrient depletion in agriculture , a terrace is a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area , designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of irrigation water intensive farming practices which are thought to be sustainable have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services these developments may fall in the category of organic farming , or the integration of organic and conventional agriculture industrial agriculture uses huge amounts of water , energy , and chemical industry , increasing pollution in the arable land , usable water , and atmosphere industrial agricultural practices are one of the main drivers of global warming , accounting for 14–28 % of net greenhouse-gas emissions convertible husbandry dryland farming environmental issues with agriculture green revolution pekarangan small-scale agriculture intensive animal farming

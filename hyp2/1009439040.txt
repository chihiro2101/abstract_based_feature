a pit-house at the daecheon-ni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period ( c british agricultural revolution saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output this in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth , freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce , and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution the first industrial woman ( new york : oxford university press , 1995 ) , p by the early 19th century , agricultural techniques , implements , seed stocks , and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages mechanical harvesters ( combines ) , planters , transplanters , and other equipment were then developed , further revolutionizing agriculture the identification of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium ( npk ) as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers , further increasing crop yields npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture , due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction , soil erosion , and declines in overall soil fertility , along with health concerns about toxic chemicals food chain there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture , and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides , which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming , as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation , a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing , poor nutrient management , and lack of soil conservation degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation , soil scarification , and the application of lime , fertilizers , and pesticides these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter , resulting in more productive , carbon-efficient livestock systems another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated crop-livestock ( icl ) and crop-livestock-forestry ( iclf ) systems , which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework these synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage , improved feed and fattening rates , increased soil fertility and quality , intensified nutrient cycle , integrated pest control , and improved biodiversity with the increased productivity of rotational systems , the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems intensive livestock farming or '' factory farming '' , is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density animal welfare and the intensification of animal production : an alternative interpretation , food and agriculture organization of the united nations , 2005 '' history of factory farming '' , united nations : '' fifty years ago in europe , intensification of animal production was seen as the road to national food security and a better diet the intensive systems—called 'factory farms ' —were characterised by confinement of the animals at high stocking density , often in barren and unnatural conditions why the organic revolution had to happen , the observer , april 21 , 2001 : '' nor is a return to 'primitive ' farming practices the only alternative to factory farming and highly intensive agriculture in a year which has been as uneventful on the husbandry side as it has been significant in economic and political developments touching the future of food procurement , the more far-seeing would name the growth of intensive farming as the major development ) '' head to head : intensive farming '' , bbc news , march 6 , 2001 : '' here , green mep caroline lucas takes issue with the intensive farming methods of recent decades she intends to end factory farming in her country '' sources discussing '' industrial farming '' , '' industrial agriculture '' and '' factory farming '' : '' annex 2 '' head to head : intensive farming '' , bbc news , march 6 , 2001 : '' here , green mep caroline lucas takes issue with the intensive farming methods of recent decades in the wake of the spread of bse from the uk to the continent of europe , the german government has appointed an agriculture minister from the green party she intends to end factory farming in her country '' is factory farming really cheaper ? '' in new scientist , institution of electrical engineers , new science publications , university of michigan , 1971 , p '' concentrated animal feeding operations '' ( cafo ) , or '' intensive livestock operations '' , can hold large numbers ( some up to hundreds of thousands ) of cows , hogs , turkeys , or chickens , often indoors the essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space cafos have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide , both in terms of total food produced and efficiency food and water is delivered to the animals , and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents , vitamin supplements , and growth hormones are often employed however , the advantage is lost for the progeny of the f1 hybrids , meaning seeds for annual crops need to be purchased every season , thus increasing costs and profits for farmers a recent development in the intensive production of rice is the system of rice intensification but other adverse effects show up within agricultural production systems—for example , the rapidly developing resistance among pests renders herbicides and insecticides increasingly ineffective convertible husbandry dryland farming environmental issues with agriculture green revolution pekarangan small-scale agriculture intensive animal farming

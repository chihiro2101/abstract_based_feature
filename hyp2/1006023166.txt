pki provides '' trust services '' - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities , be they people or computers trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities : confidentiality , integrity and authenticity ( cia ) perhaps the most common use of pki for confidentiality purposes is in the context of transport layer security ( tls ) a classic example of tls for confidentiality is when using an internet browser to log on to a service hosted on an internet based web site by entering a password the former is termed server-side authentication - typically used when authenticating to a web server using a password public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directoryâ€”i.e , a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed ; a certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued ; a certificate policy stating the pki 's requirements concerning its procedures broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key '' following major issues in how certificate issuing were managed , all major players gradually distrusted symantec issued certificates starting from 2017 an alternative approach to the problem of public authentication of public key information is the web-of-trust scheme , which uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestations of those certificates because pgp and implementations allow the use of e-mail digital signatures for self-publication of public key information , it is relatively easy to implement one 's own web of trust one of the benefits of the web of trust , such as in pgp , is that it can interoperate with a pki ca fully trusted by all parties in a domain ( such as an internal ca in a company ) that is willing to guarantee certificates , as a trusted introducer if the '' web of trust '' is completely trusted then , because of the nature of a web of trust , trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web ed gerck , overview of certification systems : x.509 , ca , pgp and skip , in the black hat briefings '99 , and the web of trust concept was first put forth by pgp creator phil zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for pgp version 2.0 : another alternative , which does not deal with public authentication of public key information , is the simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) that grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of x.509 and pgp 's web of trust some cryptocurrencies support the storage of different public key types ( ssh , gpg , rfc 2230 , etc while blockchain technology can approximate the proof of work often underpinning the confidence in trust that relying parties have in a pki , issues remain such as administrative conformance to policy , operational security and software implementation quality pki has had the most success in government implementations ; the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency ( disa ) pki infrastructure for the common access cards program a public key infrastructure enables devices to obtain and renew x509 certificates which are used to establish trust between devices and encrypt communications using tls currently the majority of web browsers are shipped with pre-installed intermediate certificates issued and signed by a certificate authority , by public keys certified by a so-called root certificates

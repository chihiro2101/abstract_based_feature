pki provides '' trust services '' - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities , be they people or computers trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities : confidentiality , integrity and authenticity ( cia ) integrity : assurance that if an entity changed ( tampered ) with transmitted data in the slightest way , it ’ d be obvious it happened as its integrity would have been compromised the latter is termed client-side authentication - sometimes used when authenticating using a smart card ( hosting a digital certificate and private key ) public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity the pki creates digital certificates which map public keys to entities , securely stores these certificates in a central repository and revokes them if needed a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) the primary role of the ca is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key when the ca is a third party separate from the user and the system , then it is called the registration authority ( ra ) , which may or may not be separate from the ca moreover , pki is itself often used as a synonym for a ca implementation to illustrate the effect of differing methodologies , amongst the million busiest sites symantec issued 44 % of the valid , trusted certificates in use — significantly more than its overall market share '' following major issues in how certificate issuing were managed , all major players gradually distrusted symantec issued certificates starting from 2017 an alternative approach to the problem of public authentication of public key information is the web-of-trust scheme , which uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestations of those certificates because pgp and implementations allow the use of e-mail digital signatures for self-publication of public key information , it is relatively easy to implement one 's own web of trust if the '' web of trust '' is completely trusted then , because of the nature of a web of trust , trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web simple public key infrastructure another alternative , which does not deal with public authentication of public key information , is the simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) that grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of x.509 and pgp 's web of trust taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol ( 'https ' in web urls ) ; it included key establishment , server authentication ( prior to v3 , one-way only ) , and so on currently the majority of web browsers are shipped with pre-installed intermediate certificates issued and signed by a certificate authority , by public keys certified by a so-called root certificates browsers have to issue a security patch to revoke intermediary certificates issued by a compromised root certificate authority

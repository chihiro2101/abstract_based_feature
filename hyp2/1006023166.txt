pki provides '' trust services '' - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities , be they people or computers perhaps the most common use of pki for confidentiality purposes is in the context of transport layer security ( tls ) a classic example of tls for confidentiality is when using an internet browser to log on to a service hosted on an internet based web site by entering a password the latter is termed client-side authentication - sometimes used when authenticating using a smart card ( hosting a digital certificate and private key ) public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity the pki creates digital certificates which map public keys to entities , securely stores these certificates in a central repository and revokes them if needed a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e , a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed ; a certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued ; a certificate policy stating the pki 's requirements concerning its procedures broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) the primary role of the ca is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key to illustrate the effect of differing methodologies , amongst the million busiest sites symantec issued 44 % of the valid , trusted certificates in use — significantly more than its overall market share an alternative approach to the problem of public authentication of public key information is the web-of-trust scheme , which uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestations of those certificates because pgp and implementations allow the use of e-mail digital signatures for self-publication of public key information , it is relatively easy to implement one 's own web of trust if the '' web of trust '' is completely trusted then , because of the nature of a web of trust , trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web simple public key infrastructure this type of pki is specially useful for making integrations of pki that do not rely on third parties for certificate authorization , certificate information , etc decentralized identifiers ( dids ) eliminates dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key management , which is the standard in hierarchical pki some cryptocurrencies support the storage of different public key types ( ssh , gpg , rfc 2230 , etc the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in 1976 by diffie , hellman , rivest , shamir , and adleman changed secure communications entirely pki has had the most success in government implementations ; the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency ( disa ) pki infrastructure for the common access cards program currently the majority of web browsers are shipped with pre-installed intermediate certificates issued and signed by a certificate authority , by public keys certified by a so-called root certificates

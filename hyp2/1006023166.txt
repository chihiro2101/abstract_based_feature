pki provides '' trust services '' - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities , be they people or computers a classic example of tls for confidentiality is when using an internet browser to log on to a service hosted on an internet based web site by entering a password integrity : assurance that if an entity changed ( tampered ) with transmitted data in the slightest way , it ’ d be obvious it happened as its integrity would have been compromised the latter is termed client-side authentication - sometimes used when authenticating using a smart card ( hosting a digital certificate and private key ) public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity the pki creates digital certificates which map public keys to entities , securely stores these certificates in a central repository and revokes them if needed a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) the primary role of the ca is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key when the ca is a third party separate from the user and the system , then it is called the registration authority ( ra ) , which may or may not be separate from the ca the key-to-user binding is established , depending on the level of assurance the binding has , by software or under human supervision the term trusted third party ( ttp ) may also be used for certificate authority ( ca ) moreover , pki is itself often used as a synonym for a ca implementation in this model of trust relationships , a ca is a trusted third party – trusted both by the subject ( owner ) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate because pgp and implementations allow the use of e-mail digital signatures for self-publication of public key information , it is relatively easy to implement one 's own web of trust a pki is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including pgp or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustworthiness of that enterprise 's or domain 's implementation of pki this type of pki is specially useful for making integrations of pki that do not rely on third parties for certificate authorization , certificate information , etc in cases where the did registry is a distributed ledger , each entity can serve as its own root authority pki has had the most success in government implementations ; the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency ( disa ) pki infrastructure for the common access cards program iot_pki is a simple pki built using the python cryptography library dogtag is a full featured ca developed and maintained as part of the fedora project browsers have to issue a security patch to revoke intermediary certificates issued by a compromised root certificate authority

pki provides '' trust services '' - in plain terms trusting the actions or outputs of entities , be they people or computers perhaps the most common use of pki for confidentiality purposes is in the context of transport layer security ( tls ) public key cryptography is a cryptographic technique that enables entities to secure communication on an insecure public network , and reliably verify the identity of an entity via digital signatures a public key infrastructure ( pki ) is a system for the creation , storage , and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity a pki consists of : a certificate authority ( ca ) that stores , issues and signs the digital certificates ; a registration authority ( ra ) which verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the ca ; a central directory—i.e , a secure location in which keys are stored and indexed ; a certificate management system managing things like the access to stored certificates or the delivery of the certificates to be issued ; a certificate policy stating the pki 's requirements concerning its procedures broadly speaking , there have traditionally been three approaches to getting this trust : certificate authority ( cas ) , web of trust ( wot ) , and simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) the primary role of the ca is to digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a given user this is done using the ca 's own private key , so that trust in the user key relies on one 's trust in the validity of the ca 's key when the ca is a third party separate from the user and the system , then it is called the registration authority ( ra ) , which may or may not be separate from the ca the term trusted third party ( ttp ) may also be used for certificate authority ( ca ) in this model of trust relationships , a ca is a trusted third party – trusted both by the subject ( owner ) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate '' following major issues in how certificate issuing were managed , all major players gradually distrusted symantec issued certificates starting from 2017 a single sign-on server will issue digital certificates into the client system , but never stores them an alternative approach to the problem of public authentication of public key information is the web-of-trust scheme , which uses self-signed certificates and third-party attestations of those certificates one of the benefits of the web of trust , such as in pgp , is that it can interoperate with a pki ca fully trusted by all parties in a domain ( such as an internal ca in a company ) that is willing to guarantee certificates , as a trusted introducer if the '' web of trust '' is completely trusted then , because of the nature of a web of trust , trusting one certificate is granting trust to all the certificates in that web a pki is only as valuable as the standards and practices that control the issuance of certificates and including pgp or a personally instituted web of trust could significantly degrade the trustworthiness of that enterprise 's or domain 's implementation of pki another alternative , which does not deal with public authentication of public key information , is the simple public key infrastructure ( spki ) that grew out of three independent efforts to overcome the complexities of x.509 and pgp 's web of trust spki does not associate users with persons , since the key is what is trusted , rather than the person this type of pki is specially useful for making integrations of pki that do not rely on third parties for certificate authorization , certificate information , etc a public key infrastructure enables devices to obtain and renew x509 certificates which are used to establish trust between devices and encrypt communications using tls currently the majority of web browsers are shipped with pre-installed intermediate certificates issued and signed by a certificate authority , by public keys certified by a so-called root certificates

many history of technology consider that true machine tools were born when the toolpath first became guided by the machine itself in some way , at least to some extent , so that direct , freehand human guidance of the toolpath ( with hands , feet , or mouth ) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process in this view of the definition , the term , arising at a time when all tools up till then had been hand tools , simply provided a label for '' tools that were machines instead of hand tools '' early lathes , those prior to the late medieval period , and modern woodworking lathes and potter 's wheels may or may not fall under this definition , depending on how one views the headstock spindle itself ; but the earliest historical records of a lathe with direct mechanical control of the cutting tool 's path are of a screw-cutting lathe dating to about 1483 the mechanical toolpath guidance grew out of various root concepts : first is the spindle concept itself , which constrains workpiece or tool movement to rotation around a fixed axis this ancient concept predates machine tools per se ; the earliest lathes and potter 's wheels incorporated it for the workpiece , but the movement of the tool itself on these machines was entirely freehand the machine slide ( tool way ) , which has many forms , such as dovetail ways , box ways , or cylindrical column ways machine slides constrain tool or workpiece movement linearly if a stop is added , the length of the line can also be accurately controlled ( machine slides are essentially a subset of linear bearings , although the language used to classify these various machine elements includes connotation boundaries ; some users in some contexts would contradistinguish elements in ways that others might not van der waals force between like metals is high ; freehand manufacture as described below in history of square plates produces only square , flat , machine tool components , accurate to millionths of an inch , but of nearly no variety the convergence of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades , in part because the programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths the latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as '' building the skill into the tool '' , in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the person who wields the tool national bureau of economic research ( nber ) referenced the definition of a machine tool as '' any machine operating by other than hand power which employs a tool to work on metal '' thus presses are usually included in the economic definition of machine tools many reports on machine tool export and import and similar economic topics use this broader definition the colloquial sense implying conventional metal cutting is also growing obsolete because of changing technology over the decades in fact , machine tool builders are already developing machines that include both subtractive and additive manufacturing in one work envelope , and retrofits of existing machines are underway this is why the machines in a food-processing plant , such as conveyors , mixers , vessels , dividers , and so on , may be labeled '' machinery '' , while the machines in the factory 's tool and die department are instead called '' machine tools '' in contradistinction thus the nber definition above could be expanded to say '' which employs a tool to work on metal or other materials of high hardness '' and its specificity to '' operating by other than hand power '' is also problematic , as machine tools can be powered by people if appropriately set up , such as with a treadle ( for a lathe ) or a hand lever ( for a shaper ) thus one can question whether power source is truly a key distinguishing concept ; but for economics purposes , the nber 's definition made sense , because most of the commercial value of the existence of machine tools comes about via those that are powered by electricity , hydraulics , and so on during the 18th and 19th centuries , and even in many cases in the 20th , the builders of machine tools tended to be the same people who would then use them to produce the end products ( manufactured goods ) historians of machine tools often focus on a handful of major industries that most spurred machine tool development . others , such as henry maudslay , james nasmyth , and joseph whitworth , soon followed the path of expanding their entrepreneurship from manufactured end products and millwright work into the realm of building machine tools for sale today most machine tools are powered by electricity ; hydraulic and pneumatic power are sometimes used , but this is uncommon among these are : electrical discharge machining grinding ( abrasive cutting ) cutting tool ( metalworking ) single edge cutting tools other techniques are used to add desired material

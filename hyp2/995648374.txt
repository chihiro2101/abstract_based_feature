many history of technology consider that true machine tools were born when the toolpath first became guided by the machine itself in some way , at least to some extent , so that direct , freehand human guidance of the toolpath ( with hands , feet , or mouth ) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process in this view of the definition , the term , arising at a time when all tools up till then had been hand tools , simply provided a label for '' tools that were machines instead of hand tools '' the mechanical toolpath guidance grew out of various root concepts : first is the spindle concept itself , which constrains workpiece or tool movement to rotation around a fixed axis this ancient concept predates machine tools per se ; the earliest lathes and potter 's wheels incorporated it for the workpiece , but the movement of the tool itself on these machines was entirely freehand machine slides constrain tool or workpiece movement linearly ( machine slides are essentially a subset of linear bearings , although the language used to classify these various machine elements includes connotation boundaries ; some users in some contexts would contradistinguish elements in ways that others might not van der waals force between like metals is high ; freehand manufacture as described below in history of square plates produces only square , flat , machine tool components , accurate to millionths of an inch , but of nearly no variety the process of feature replication allows the flatness and squareness of a milling machine or the roundness , lack of taper , and squareness of the two axes of a lathe machine to be transferred to a machined work piece with accuracy and precision better than a thousandth of an inch , not as fine as millionths of an inch the convergence of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades , in part because the programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths the value that machine tools added to these human talents is in the areas of rigidity ( constraining the toolpath despite thousands of newtons ( pounds ) of force fighting against the constraint ) , accuracy and precision , efficiency , and productivity with a machine tool , toolpaths that no human muscle could constrain can be constrained ; and toolpaths that are technically possible with freehand methods , but would require tremendous time and skill to execute , can instead be executed quickly and easily , even by people with little freehand talent ( because the machine takes care of it ) the latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as '' building the skill into the tool '' , in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the person who wields the tool national bureau of economic research ( nber ) referenced the definition of a machine tool as '' any machine operating by other than hand power which employs a tool to work on metal '' . the narrowest colloquial sense of the term reserves it only for machines that perform metal cutting—in other words , the many kinds of conventional machining and grinding however , economists use a slightly broader sense that also includes metal deformation of other types that squeeze the metal into shape without cutting off swarf , such as rolling , stamping with dies , shearing , swaging , riveting , and others in addition , some of the newly developed additive manufacturing processes , which are not about cutting away material but rather about adding it , are done by machines that are likely to end up labeled , in some cases , as machine tools many speakers resist using the term '' machine tool '' to refer to woodworking machinery ( joiners , table saws , routing stations , and so on ) , but it is difficult to maintain any true logical dividing line , and therefore many speakers accept a broad definition usually the mass noun '' machinery '' encompasses them , but sometimes it is used to imply only those machines that are being excluded from the definition of '' machine tool '' this is why the machines in a food-processing plant , such as conveyors , mixers , vessels , dividers , and so on , may be labeled '' machinery '' , while the machines in the factory 's tool and die department are instead called '' machine tools '' in contradistinction regarding the 1930s nber definition quoted above , one could argue that its specificity to metal is obsolete , as it is quite common today for particular lathes , milling machines , and machining centers ( definitely machine tools ) to work exclusively on plastic cutting jobs throughout their whole working lifespan thus the nber definition above could be expanded to say '' which employs a tool to work on metal or other materials of high hardness '' . but it was not until the later middle ages and the age of enlightenment that the modern concept of a machine tool—a class of machines used as tools in the making of metal parts , and incorporating machine-guided toolpath—began to evolve during the 18th and 19th centuries , and even in many cases in the 20th , the builders of machine tools tended to be the same people who would then use them to produce the end products ( manufactured goods ) . others , such as henry maudslay , james nasmyth , and joseph whitworth , soon followed the path of expanding their entrepreneurship from manufactured end products and millwright work into the realm of building machine tools for sale early machines used flywheels to stabilize their motion and had complex systems of gears and levers to control the machine and the piece being worked on before long , the machines could automatically change the specific cutting and shaping tools that were being used

many history of technology consider that true machine tools were born when the toolpath first became guided by the machine itself in some way , at least to some extent , so that direct , freehand human guidance of the toolpath ( with hands , feet , or mouth ) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process in this view of the definition , the term , arising at a time when all tools up till then had been hand tools , simply provided a label for '' tools that were machines instead of hand tools '' this ancient concept predates machine tools per se ; the earliest lathes and potter 's wheels incorporated it for the workpiece , but the movement of the tool itself on these machines was entirely freehand the machine slide ( tool way ) , which has many forms , such as dovetail ways , box ways , or cylindrical column ways machine slides constrain tool or workpiece movement linearly ( machine slides are essentially a subset of linear bearings , although the language used to classify these various machine elements includes connotation boundaries ; some users in some contexts would contradistinguish elements in ways that others might not cam operation , which is related in principle to tracing but can be a step or two removed from the traced element 's matching the reproduced element 's final shape for example , several cams , no one of which directly matches the desired output shape , can actuate a complex toolpath by creating component vectors that add up to a net toolpath abstractly programmable toolpath guidance began with mechanical solutions , such as in musical box cams and jacquard looms the convergence of programmable mechanical control with machine tool toolpath control was delayed many decades , in part because the programmable control methods of musical boxes and looms lacked the rigidity for machine tool toolpaths the latter aspect of machine tools is often referred to by historians of technology as '' building the skill into the tool '' , in contrast to the toolpath-constraining skill being in the person who wields the tool but it is economically practical to make them only with machine tools national bureau of economic research ( nber ) referenced the definition of a machine tool as '' any machine operating by other than hand power which employs a tool to work on metal '' . the narrowest colloquial sense of the term reserves it only for machines that perform metal cutting—in other words , the many kinds of conventional machining and grinding which is also a history of the machine tool industry in general from the 1940s through the 1980s ; he was reflecting the sense of the term used by houdaille itself and other firms in the industry it is common to hear machinists refer to their machine tools simply as '' machines '' usually the mass noun '' machinery '' encompasses them , but sometimes it is used to imply only those machines that are being excluded from the definition of '' machine tool '' thus the nber definition above could be expanded to say '' which employs a tool to work on metal or other materials of high hardness '' . but it was not until the later middle ages and the age of enlightenment that the modern concept of a machine tool—a class of machines used as tools in the making of metal parts , and incorporating machine-guided toolpath—began to evolve during the 18th and 19th centuries , and even in many cases in the 20th , the builders of machine tools tended to be the same people who would then use them to produce the end products ( manufactured goods ) however , from these roots also evolved an industry of machine tool builders as we define them today , meaning people who specialize in building machine tools for sale to others sometime after 1825 , whitworth went to work for maudslay and it was there that whitworth perfected the hand scraping of master surface plane gages important early machine tools included the slide rest lathe , screw-cutting lathe , turret lathe , milling machine , pattern tracing lathe , shaper , and metal planer , which were all in use before 1840 before long , the machines could automatically change the specific cutting and shaping tools that were being used the next logical step was to combine several different machine tools together , all under computer control among these are : electrical discharge machining grinding ( abrasive cutting ) cutting tool ( metalworking ) single edge cutting tools other techniques are used to add desired material

launch of ulster television ( now known as utv ) by the end of the 1950s , 60 % of the population could receive bbc 1 and the uk 's itv from spillover from northern ireland , wales and the west of england throughout the 1950s the irish government discussed the provision of an irish television service ; this was headed up by leon o'broin , the secretary at the department of post and telegraphs in 1950 o'broin established his own committee on irish television and bought a television set to receive broadcasts from the bbc the department of finance at this time were worried of the cost of setting up a new television service and dismissed the possibility on several occasions during the 1950s by march 1951 o'broin would press for the inevitable establishment of an irish television service in the state the public service broadcaster , telefís éireann , opened in 1961 , followed by an additional channel rté2 in november 1978 tg4 launched on 31 october 1996 as a free-to-air public broadcasting that targets irish language viewers in the 2000s television in ireland expanded with the launch of eir sport 1 , bubble hits ( now defunct ) and 3e ( originally c6 on cable , later added

digital terrestrial television ( dtt ) in october 2010 of commercial services with the possibility of more public service channels from existing public service broadcaster and possibly two new channels , the houses of the oireachtas channel and the irish film channel , subject to finance from the government for the last two the then minister for communications pat rabbitte aspired to have a

ireland 's national free-to-air digital terrestrial television ( dtt ) service , launched officially to the public in may 2011 the bai have since ended negotiations to find a suitable service provider for such content public service channels are carried by 2rn ( under the saorview brand ) , with this service operational to 90 % of the country by 31 october 2010 and complete by 31 december 2011 ( 98 % ) the irish system , being used by both rténl and any subsequent commercial dtt provider is a mpeg-4 dvb-t service with an mheg-5 interactive layer rté television were awarded a licence to operate a single multiplex , with a second multiplex which followed once analogue broadcasting ceased on 24 october 2012 as the freeview hd system is based on the newer dvb-t2 standard , saorview reception is dependent on the backward compatibility of such devices rtéast networks also broadcast test dvb-t with analogue tv and radio channels from the clermont carn transmitter in the cooley mountains , county louth with some signal bleed into northern ireland they had no broadband licence and no viable business plan without selling broadband , and due to lack of funding withdrew its application in october 2002 the government also planned to privatise rté 's transmission network at this time but this too failed in october 2002 following the withdrawal of its digital limited dtt licence application and a number of other factors the establishment of a commercial multiplex for digital television terrestrial within ireland was punctuated with many delays the bai ( then the broadcasting commission of ireland ) engaged in two phases of targeted consultation to assist in the development of its dtt multiplex licensing policy it was initially proposed that rté television would operate the free-to-air public service multiplex , rténl would provide the relevant broadcasting technologies and a third party would provide the pay or subscription service on 20 april 2009 , the bai announced that boxer had ended negotiations on the dtt contract without a successful outcome this agreement was designed to ensure viewers within northern ireland could watch rté one , rté2 and tg4 on a free-to-air basis after the digital switchover in practice all bbc satellite channels can be received freely in the republic of ireland , due to overspill from the united kingdom this increased the coverage of these channels in northern ireland , to 90 % of the population in northern ireland to receive their services on a free-to-air basis , either through overspill as before or via the new multiplex the former analogue signals were switched off on a co-ordinated basis in the republic of ireland and northern ireland on 24 october 2012 foreseen as part of the agreement between both governments was the establishment of a joint venture ( as a not-for-profit company ) between rté and tg4 to run the multiplex which is licensed under the uk 's wireless telegraphy act 2006 by ofcom at the request of the uk government sky digital , ireland 's first digital television service , launched in october 1998 digital satellite is the only form of subscriber satellite transmission available

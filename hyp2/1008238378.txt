image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences the collodion process was invented in 1851 by frederick scott archer and theorized a year earlier by gustave le gray during the subsequent decades , many photographers and experimenters refined or varied the process by the end of the 1860s it had almost entirely replaced the first announced photographic process , the daguerreotype during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plateâ€”glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times the wet plate collodion process has undergone a revival as a historical technique in the twenty-first century thumb the collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support ( glass ) this was an improvement over the calotype process , discovered by henry fox talbot , which relied on paper negatives , and the daguerreotype , which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate when coated on glass , the image becomes a negative , and can be reproduced easily on photographic paper with glass as the medium , the cost per image was also far less than special silver-plated copper plates , and more durable than paper negatives the wet collodion process had a major disadvantage the plate dripped silver nitrate solution , causing stains and potentially explosive build-up of nitrate residue in the camera and plate holders as with all preceding photographic processes , the wet-collodion process was sensitive only to blue and ultraviolet light despite its disadvantages , wet plate collodion became enormously popular an image could require anywhere from three to ten times more exposure on a dry plate than on a wet plate these emulsions were slow , and could not be developed , so they were mostly used for positive printing in the wet collodion process , silver nitrate reacted with a halide salt ; potassium iodide , for example : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process albumen print ambrotype august semmendinger calotype collodion daguerreotype excelsior wet plate camera tintype

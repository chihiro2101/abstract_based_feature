image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences the collodion process was invented in 1851 by frederick scott archer and theorized a year earlier by gustave le gray during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plateâ€”glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times the wet plate collodion process has undergone a revival as a historical technique in the twenty-first century fine art photographers use the process and its handcrafted individuality for gallery showings and personal work thumb the collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support ( glass ) as collodion is a sticky and transparent medium , and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet , it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate wet plate/collodion is also a relatively inexpensive process compared to its predecessor , and does not require polishing equipment or the extremely toxic fuming boxes needed for the daguerreotype with glass as the medium , the cost per image was also far less than special silver-plated copper plates , and more durable than paper negatives the process was also very fast for the time , requiring only a few seconds to expose an image in daylight , rather than 30 seconds or more for other forms of photography available in the mid-1800s the wet collodion process had a major disadvantage a sky with clouds is quite difficult to render , as the spectrum of white clouds contains about as much blue as the sky despite its disadvantages , wet plate collodion became enormously popular the largest collodion glass plate negatives produced in the nineteenth century were made in sydney , australia , in 1875 3 the wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process in the wet collodion process , silver nitrate reacted with a halide salt ; potassium iodide , for example :21.4 & nbsp ; grams of silver nitrate are dissolved in 7.4 ml of water : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process : collodion emulsion plates were developed in an alkaline developer , not unlike those in common use today

image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plateâ€”glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times the wet plate collodion process has undergone a revival as a historical technique in the twenty-first century brummm magazine , issue 2 , 2016 there are several practising ambrotype and tintypists who regularly set up and make images , for example at civil war re-enactments and arts festivals fine art photographers use the process and its handcrafted individuality for gallery showings and personal work modern collodion artists includes sally mann , ben cauchi , '' ben cauchi , '' the arts foundation ( new zealand ) thumb the collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support ( glass ) this was an improvement over the calotype process , discovered by henry fox talbot , which relied on paper negatives , and the daguerreotype , which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated as collodion is a sticky and transparent medium , and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet , it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography the wet collodion process had a major disadvantage the plate dripped silver nitrate solution , causing stains and potentially explosive build-up of nitrate residue in the camera and plate holders it was used for portraiture , landscape work , architectural photography and art photography the largest collodion glass plate negatives produced in the nineteenth century were made in sydney , australia , in 1875 3 the wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process world wet plate day is staged annually in may for contemporary practitioners an image could require anywhere from three to ten times more exposure on a dry plate than on a wet plate sayce published an idea for a process that would revolutionize photography it was not as fast as the ordinary wet process , but was not nearly as slow as the dry plate processes below is an example of the preparation of a collodion emulsion , from the late 19th century : emulsions created in this manner could be used wet , but they were often coated on the plate and preserved in similar ways to the dry process

image : theodore roosevelt on broken glass.jpg thumb this deteriorated dry plate portrait of theodore roosevelt is similar to a wet plate image but has substantial differences the collodion process was invented in 1851 by frederick scott archer and theorized a year earlier by gustave le gray by the end of the 1860s it had almost entirely replaced the first announced photographic process , the daguerreotype during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plateâ€”glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times the wet plate collodion process has undergone a revival as a historical technique in the twenty-first century fine art photographers use the process and its handcrafted individuality for gallery showings and personal work thumb the collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support ( glass ) this was an improvement over the calotype process , discovered by henry fox talbot , which relied on paper negatives , and the daguerreotype , which produced a one-of-a-kind positive image and could not be replicated as collodion is a sticky and transparent medium , and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet , it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate when coated on glass , the image becomes a negative , and can be reproduced easily on photographic paper the wet collodion process had a major disadvantage the entire process , from coating to developing , had to be done before the plate dried despite its disadvantages , wet plate collodion became enormously popular . search for a dry collodion process an image could require anywhere from three to ten times more exposure on a dry plate than on a wet plate a light-sensitive plate could then be prepared by simply flowing this emulsion across the surface of a glass plate ; no silver nitrate bath was required it was not as fast as the ordinary wet process , but was not nearly as slow as the dry plate processes : collodion emulsion plates were developed in an alkaline developer , not unlike those in common use today albumen print ambrotype august semmendinger calotype collodion daguerreotype excelsior wet plate camera tintype

the collodion process was invented in 1851 by frederick scott archer and theorized a year earlier by gustave le gray during the subsequent decades , many photographers and experimenters refined or varied the process during the 1880s , the collodion process was largely replaced by dry plateâ€”glass plates with a photographic emulsion of silver halides suspended in gelatin the dry gelatin emulsion was not only more convenient , but it could also be made much more sensitive , greatly reducing exposure times the wet plate collodion process has undergone a revival as a historical technique in the twenty-first century fine art photographers use the process and its handcrafted individuality for gallery showings and personal work there are several makers of reproduction equipment and many artists work with collodion around the globe thumb the collodion process produced a negative image on a transparent support ( glass ) collodion printing was typically done on albumen print as collodion is a sticky and transparent medium , and can be soaked in a solution of silver nitrate while wet , it is ideal for coating stable surfaces such as glass or metal for photography when a metal plate is coated with collodion , charged with silver nitrate , exposed , and developed , it produces a direct positive image , although 'backwards ' on the plate the wet collodion process had a major disadvantage this made it inconvenient for field use , as it required a portable darkroom it gradually became saturated with alcohol , ether , iodide and bromide salts , dust , and various organic matter despite its disadvantages , wet plate collodion became enormously popular it was used for portraiture , landscape work , architectural photography and art photography 3 the wet plate process is used by a number of artists and experimenters who prefer its aesthetic qualities to those of the more modern gelatin silver process . search for a dry collodion process it was not as fast as the ordinary wet process , but was not nearly as slow as the dry plate processes below is an example of the preparation of a collodion emulsion , from the late 19th century albumen print ambrotype august semmendinger calotype collodion daguerreotype excelsior wet plate camera tintype

recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably in 1956 , norman phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere it became the first successful climate model the first to combine both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory by the early 1980s , the united states ' national center for atmospheric research had developed the community atmosphere model ; this model has been continuously refined later the hadley centre for climate prediction and research 's hadcm3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements gravity waves are required to simulate regional and global scale circulations accurately atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model three-dimensional ( more properly four-dimensional ) gcms apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity examples are programs that solve the primitive equations , given energy input and energy dissipation in the form of scale-dependent friction , so that atmospheric waves with the highest wavenumbers are most attenuated such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc aogcms internalise as many processes as possible while the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand , aogcms may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself the fluid equations for agcms are made discrete using either the finite difference method or the spectral method hadgem1 ( and other ocean models ) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for the el niño ( enso ) hadgem1 uses a grid of 1.875 degrees in longitude and 1.25 in latitude in the atmosphere ; higem , a high-resolution variant , uses 1.25 x 0.83 degrees respectively however , if the fluxes were 'corrected ' , the factors that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised , which could affect model sensitivity as a result , the vast majority of models used in the current round of ipcc reports do not use them improved models now maintain stable , multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models , and hence it must be handled via parameters an example is the 2-metre temperature , which is the standard height for near-surface observations of air temperature coupled aogcms use transient climate simulations to project/predict climate changes under various scenarios climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere and impose sea surface temperatures as boundary conditions the climber-3 model uses a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of 1/2 a day

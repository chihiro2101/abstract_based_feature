the acronym gcm originally stood for general circulation model recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably however , the term '' global climate model '' is ambiguous and may refer to an integrated framework that incorporates multiple components including a general circulation model , or may refer to the general class of climate models that use a variety of means to represent the climate mathematically in 1956 , norman phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere it became the first successful climate model the first to combine both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory by the early 1980s , the united states ' national center for atmospheric research had developed the community atmosphere model ; this model has been continuously refined later the hadley centre for climate prediction and research 's hadcm3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model three-dimensional ( more properly four-dimensional ) gcms apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) as an example , pressure at any height can be diagnosed by applying the hydrostatic equation to the predicted surface pressure and the predicted values of temperature between the surface and the height of interest ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc while the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand , aogcms may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself the fluid equations for agcms are made discrete using either the finite difference method or the spectral method , icosahedral ) and grids of variable resolution see also are more often used some early versions of aogcms required an ad hoc process of '' flux correction '' to achieve a stable climate the model improvements that now make flux corrections unnecessary include improved ocean physics , improved resolution in both atmosphere and ocean , and more physically consistent coupling between atmosphere and ocean submodels improved models now maintain stable , multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections gcms are capable of reproducing the general features of the observed global temperature over the past century since forecasts are typically a few days or a week and sea surface temperatures change relatively slowly , such models do not usually contain an ocean model but rely on imposed ssts like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the gfs , global climate models are often spectral models instead of grid models climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere , oceans , land surface and ice , climate change 2007 chapter 10 : global climate projections , in ( pb : three ( or more properly , four since time is also considered ) dimensional gcm 's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time the climber-3 model uses a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of 1/2 a day gcms can form part of earth system models , e.g

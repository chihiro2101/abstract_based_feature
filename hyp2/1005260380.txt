the acronym gcm originally stood for general circulation model recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably in 1956 , norman phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere it became the first successful climate model the first to combine both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in 1996 , efforts began to model soil and vegetation types later the hadley centre for climate prediction and research 's hadcm3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements . atmospheric and oceanic models atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model three-dimensional ( more properly four-dimensional ) gcms apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model they remove the need to specify fluxes across the interface of the ocean surface these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc the fluid equations for agcms are made discrete using either the finite difference method or the spectral method , icosahedral ) and grids of variable resolution see also are more often used typical agcm resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude : hadcm3 , for example , uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude , giving a grid of 96 by 73 points ( 96 x 72 for some variables ) ; and has 19 vertical levels for a standard finite difference model , uniform gridlines converge towards the poles this would lead to computational instabilities ( see cfl condition ) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles some early versions of aogcms required an ad hoc process of '' flux correction '' to achieve a stable climate however , if the fluxes were 'corrected ' , the factors that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised , which could affect model sensitivity convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models , and hence it must be handled via parameters akio arakawa did much of the early work , and variants of his scheme are still used , although a variety of different schemes are now in use clouds are also typically handled with a parameter , for a similar lack of scale the global climate models used for climate projections are similar in structure to ( and often share computer code with ) numerical weather prediction , but are nonetheless logically distinct like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the gfs , global climate models are often spectral models instead of grid models by coupling ice sheet models for the dynamics of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets , and one or more chemical transport models ( ctms ) for species important to climate

the acronym gcm originally stood for general circulation model recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably it became the first successful climate model following phillips 's work , several groups began working to create gcms by the early 1980s , the united states ' national center for atmospheric research had developed the community atmosphere model ; this model has been continuously refined later the hadley centre for climate prediction and research 's hadcm3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements gravity waves are required to simulate regional and global scale circulations accurately atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc while the simpler models are generally susceptible to analysis and their results are easier to understand , aogcms may be nearly as hard to analyse as the climate itself , icosahedral ) and grids of variable resolution see also are more often used ncar command language documentation : non-uniform grids that ncl can contour ( retrieved 24 july 2010 ) the lmdz model can be arranged to give high resolution over any given section of the planet typical agcm resolutions are between 1 and 5 degrees in latitude or longitude : hadcm3 , for example , uses 3.75 in longitude and 2.5 degrees in latitude , giving a grid of 96 by 73 points ( 96 x 72 for some variables ) ; and has 19 vertical levels this would lead to computational instabilities ( see cfl condition ) and so the model variables must be filtered along lines of latitude close to the poles ocean models suffer from this problem too , unless a rotated grid is used in which the north pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass improved models now maintain stable , multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models , and hence it must be handled via parameters most models include software to diagnose a wide range of variables for comparison with observations or process study this temperature is not directly predicted from the model but is deduced from surface and lowest-model-layer temperatures in a projection designed to simulate a future where no efforts are made to reduce global emissions , the likely rise in global average temperature was predicted to be 5.5 & nbsp ; °c by 2100 under the same emissions scenario but with a different model , the predicted median warming was 4.1 & nbsp ; °c like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the gfs , global climate models are often spectral models instead of grid models spectral models are often used for global models because some computations in modeling can be performed faster , thus reducing run times the climber-3 model uses a 2.5-dimensional statistical-dynamical model with 7.5° × 22.5° resolution and time step of 1/2 a day one-dimensional , radiative-convective models were used to verify basic climate assumptions in the 1980s and 1990s

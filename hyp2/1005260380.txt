the acronym gcm originally stood for general circulation model recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably in 1956 , norman phillips developed a mathematical model that could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere it became the first successful climate model by the early 1980s , the united states ' national center for atmospheric research had developed the community atmosphere model ; this model has been continuously refined later the hadley centre for climate prediction and research 's hadcm3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements gravity waves are required to simulate regional and global scale circulations accurately atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model a simple general circulation model ( sgcm ) consists of a dynamic core that relates properties such as temperature to others such as pressure and velocity such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) ogcms model the ocean ( with fluxes from the atmosphere imposed ) and may contain a sea ice model they remove the need to specify fluxes across the interface of the ocean surface hadgem1 ( and other ocean models ) use an ocean grid with higher resolution in the tropics to help resolve processes believed to be important for the el niño ( enso ) spectral models generally use a gaussian grid , because of the mathematics of transformation between spectral and grid-point space this results in approximately 500,000 '' basic '' variables , since each grid point has four variables ( u , v , t , q ) , though a full count would give more ( clouds ; soil levels ) ocean resolutions tend to be higher , for example hadcm3 has 6 ocean grid points per atmospheric grid point in the horizontal ocean models suffer from this problem too , unless a rotated grid is used in which the north pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass another approach to solving the grid spacing problem is to deform a cartesian cube such that it covers the surface of a sphere some early versions of aogcms required an ad hoc process of '' flux correction '' to achieve a stable climate this resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce improved models now maintain stable , multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections convection occurs on too small a scale to be resolved by climate models , and hence it must be handled via parameters under the same emissions scenario but with a different model , the predicted median warming was 4.1 & nbsp ; °c climate researchers around the world use climate models to understand the climate system weather predictions are required at higher temporal resolutions than climate projections , often sub-hourly compared to monthly or yearly averages for climate like most global numerical weather prediction models such as the gfs , global climate models are often spectral models instead of grid models , climate change 2007 chapter 10 : global climate projections , in ( pb : three ( or more properly , four since time is also considered ) dimensional gcm 's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time comparison with other climate models

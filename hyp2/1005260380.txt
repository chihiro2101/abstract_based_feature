the acronym gcm originally stood for general circulation model recently , a second meaning came into use , namely global climate model while these do not refer to the same thing , general circulation models are typically the tools used for climate model , and hence the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably it became the first successful climate model the first to combine both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory by the early 1980s , the united states ' national center for atmospheric research had developed the community atmosphere model ; this model has been continuously refined later the hadley centre for climate prediction and research 's hadcm3 model coupled ocean-atmosphere elements atmospheric ( agcms ) and oceanic gcms ( ogcms ) can be coupled to form an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model ( cgcm or aogcm ) with the addition of submodels such as a sea ice model or a model for evapotranspiration over land , aogcms become the basis for a full climate model three-dimensional ( more properly four-dimensional ) gcms apply discrete equations for fluid motion and integrate these forward in time examples are programs that solve the primitive equations , given energy input and energy dissipation in the form of scale-dependent friction , so that atmospheric waves with the highest wavenumbers are most attenuated such models may be used to study atmospheric processes , but are not suitable for climate projections atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere ( and typically contain a land-surface model as well ) using imposed sea surface temperatures ( ssts ) these models are the basis for model predictions of future climate , such as are discussed by the ipcc ocean resolutions tend to be higher , for example hadcm3 has 6 ocean grid points per atmospheric grid point in the horizontal for a standard finite difference model , uniform gridlines converge towards the poles ocean models suffer from this problem too , unless a rotated grid is used in which the north pole is shifted onto a nearby landmass some early versions of aogcms required an ad hoc process of '' flux correction '' to achieve a stable climate this resulted from separately prepared ocean and atmospheric models that each used an implicit flux from the other component different than that component could produce however , if the fluxes were 'corrected ' , the factors that led to these unrealistic fluxes might be unrecognised , which could affect model sensitivity as a result , the vast majority of models used in the current round of ipcc reports do not use them improved models now maintain stable , multi-century simulations of surface climate that are considered to be of sufficient quality to allow their use for climate projections this temperature is not directly predicted from the model but is deduced from surface and lowest-model-layer temperatures coupled aogcms use transient climate simulations to project/predict climate changes under various scenarios in a projection designed to simulate a future where no efforts are made to reduce global emissions , the likely rise in global average temperature was predicted to be 5.5 & nbsp ; Â°c by 2100 they may be coupled to models of other processes in earth system models , such as the carbon cycle , so as to better model feedbacks climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere , oceans , land surface and ice , climate change 2007 chapter 10 : global climate projections , in ( pb : three ( or more properly , four since time is also considered ) dimensional gcm 's discretise the equations for fluid motion and energy transfer and integrate these over time atmospheric gcms ( agcms ) model the atmosphere and impose sea surface temperatures as boundary conditions comparison with other climate models atmospheric model intercomparison project ( amip ) atmospheric radiation measurement ( arm ) ( in the us ) earth simulator global environmental multiscale model ice-sheet model intermediate general circulation model ncar prognostic variable

client-server applications use the tls protocol to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering since applications can communicate either with or without tls ( or ssl ) , it is necessary for the client to indicate to the server the setup of a tls connection one of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for tls connections , for example port 443 for https once the client and server have agreed to use tls , they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure this concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection , which is encrypted and decrypted with the session key until the connection closes tls runs '' on top of some reliable transport protocol ( e.g it serves encryption to higher layers , which is normally the function of the presentation layer from the application protocol point of view , tls belongs to a lower layer , although the tcp/ip model is too coarse to show it this extension hints to the server immediately which name the client wishes to connect to , so the server can select the appropriate certificate to send to the clients : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.1 '' : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.2 '' specifies an extension to the imap , pop3 and acap services that allow the server and client to use transport-layer security to provide private , authenticated communication over the internet : '' addition of kerberos cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' extensions to tls 1.1 include : : '' datagram transport layer security '' specifies a tls variant that works over datagram protocols ( such as udp ) : '' transport layer security ( tls ) extensions '' describes both a set of specific extensions and a generic extension mechanism : '' using openpgp keys for transport layer security ( tls ) authentication '' , obsoleted by : '' using openpgp keys for transport layer security ( tls ) authentication '' : '' addition of the aria cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' encrypt-then-mac for transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram transport layer security ( dtls ) ''

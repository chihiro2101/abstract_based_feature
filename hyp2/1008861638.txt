client-server applications use the tls protocol to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering since applications can communicate either with or without tls ( or ssl ) , it is necessary for the client to indicate to the server the setup of a tls connection one of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for tls connections , for example port 443 for https another mechanism is for the client to make a protocol-specific request to the server to switch the connection to tls ; for example , by making a starttls request when using the mail and news protocols once the client and server have agreed to use tls , they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure the protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish not only cipher settings but also a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher if any one of the above steps fails , then the tls handshake fails and the connection is not created this means that the tls handshake is usually ( except in the starttls case ) performed before the application protocol can start the current approved version of tls is version 1.3 , which is specified in : : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.3 '' the current standard replaces these former versions , which are now considered obsolete : : '' the tls protocol version 1.0 '' : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.1 '' : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.2 '' : '' addition of kerberos cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' transport layer security protocol compression methods '' , specifies the framework for compression methods and the deflate compression method : '' addition of seed cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' extensions to tls 1.1 include : : '' datagram transport layer security '' specifies a tls variant that works over datagram protocols ( such as udp ) : '' using openpgp keys for transport layer security ( tls ) authentication '' : '' aes-ccm cipher suites for transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' encrypt-then-mac for transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram transport layer security ( dtls ) ''

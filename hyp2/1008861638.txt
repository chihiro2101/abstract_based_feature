one of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for tls connections , for example port 443 for https once the client and server have agreed to use tls , they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure the certificate contains the hostname , the trusted certificate authority ( ca ) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate , and the server 's public encryption key this concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection , which is encrypted and decrypted with the session key until the connection closes tls and ssl do not fit neatly into any single layer of the osi model or the tcp/ip model however , applications generally use tls as if it were a transport layer , even though applications using tls must actively control initiating tls handshakes and handling of exchanged authentication certificates to provide the server name , transport layer security ( tls ) extensions allow clients to include a server name indication extension ( sni ) in the extended clienthello message the current approved version of tls is version 1.3 , which is specified in : : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.3 '' : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.1 '' : '' the transport layer security ( tls ) protocol version 1.2 '' specifies an extension to the imap , pop3 and acap services that allow the server and client to use transport-layer security to provide private , authenticated communication over the internet : '' transport layer security protocol compression methods '' , specifies the framework for compression methods and the deflate compression method : '' addition of seed cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' elliptic curve cryptography ( ecc ) cipher suites for transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' transport layer security ( tls ) renegotiation indication extension '' : '' addition of the camellia cipher suites to transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' aes-ccm cipher suites for transport layer security ( tls ) '' : '' encrypt-then-mac for transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram transport layer security ( dtls ) '' : '' summarizing known attacks on transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram tls ( dtls ) '' : '' recommendations for secure use of transport layer security ( tls ) and datagram transport layer security ( dtls ) ''

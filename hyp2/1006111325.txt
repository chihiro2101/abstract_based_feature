in the 1800s , american colleges , controlled by clergymen , continued to embrace classics that had little relevance to an industrializing nation few offered courses in the sciences , modern languages , history , or political economy — and only a handful had graduate schools as businessmen became increasingly reluctant to send their sons to schools whose curricula offered nothing useful — or to donate money for their support , some educational leaders began exploring ways of making higher education more attractive some backed the establishment of specialized schools of science and technology , like harvard 's lawrence scientific school , yale 's sheffield scientific school , and the newly chartered massachusetts institute of technology , about to offer its first classes in 1865 boston 's business leaders , many of them harvard alumni , were pressing for change — though with no clear idea of the kinds of changes they wanted on his return to the united states in 1865 , eliot accepted an appointment as professor of analytical chemistry at the newly founded massachusetts institute of technology this change was made in 1865 , and at the same time the governor and other state officers ceased to form part of the board the effect of this change was to greatly strengthen the interest of the alumni in the management of the university , and thus to prepare the way for extensive and thorough reforms early in 1869 , eliot had presented his ideas about reforming american higher education in a compelling two-part article , '' the new education , '' in the atlantic monthly , the nation 's leading journal of opinion '' we are fighting a wilderness , physical and moral , '' eliot declared in setting forth his vision of the american university , '' for this fight we must be trained and armed shortly after their appearance , merely 35 years old , he was elected as the youngest president in the history of the nation 's oldest university eliot 's educational vision incorporated important elements of unitarian and emersonian ideas about character development , framed by a pragmatic understanding of the role of higher education in economic and political leadership although his methods were pragmatic , eliot 's ultimate goal , like those of the secularized puritanism of the boston elite , was a spiritual one it was embedded in the material world and consisted of measurable progress of the human spirit towards mastery of human intelligence over nature — the '' moral and spiritual wilderness '' while this mastery depended on each individual fully realizing his capacities , it was ultimately a collective achievement and the product of institutions which established the conditions both for individual and collective achievement framed by the higher purposes of a research university in the service of the nation , specialized expertise could be harnessed to public purposes '' when the revelation of his own peculiar taste and capacity comes to a young man , let him reverently give it welcome , thank god , and take courage , '' eliot declared in his inaugural address accompanying this was a shift in pedagogy from recitations and lectures towards classes that put students ' achievements to the test and , through a revised grading system , rigorously assessed individual performance his own kinsman samuel eliot morison in his tercentenary history of harvard made this devastating assessment : during his life , eliot had been involved in at least five unsuccessful attempts to absorb mit into harvard they had four sons , one of whom , charles eliot ( november 1 , 1859 – march 25 , 1897 ) became an important landscape architect , responsible for boston 's public park system '' eliot was an articulate opponent of american imperialism , and he was opposed to the education of women in celebration of president eliot 's 90 birthday , congratulations came in across the world and notably from two american presidents over one hundred inscriptions were composed by president eliot , placed on buildings ranging from schools , churches , public buildings , memorial tablets , numerous monuments , and to the library of congress yale university 1871 member american philosophical society 1873 member massachusetts historical society 1879 honorary member american library association american library association

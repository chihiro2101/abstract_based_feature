the tortoise then asks achilles whether there might be a reader of euclid who grants that the argument is logically valid , as a sequence , while denying that a and b are true achilles accepts that such a reader might exist ( that is , a reader who denies the premises ) , and that he would hold that if a and b are true , then z must be true , while not yet accepting that a and b are true the tortoise then asks achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist , who accepts that a and b are true , but who does not yet accept the principle that if a and b are both true , then z must be true achilles grants the tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist the tortoise , then , asks achilles to treat the tortoise as a reader of this second kind achilles must now logically compel the tortoise to accept that z must be true likewise , a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system , and when a person reasons according to this formal system , he can not question or differ from these inference rules , but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system in this way , formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress : modus ponens is placed as a rule within the system , the validity of modus ponens is eschewed to without the system a number of websites , including '' what the tortoise said to achilles '' at digital text international , and '' what the tortoise said to achilles '' at fair use repository

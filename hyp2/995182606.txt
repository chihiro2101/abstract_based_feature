the tortoise then asks achilles whether there might be a reader of euclid who grants that the argument is logically valid , as a sequence , while denying that a and b are true achilles accepts that such a reader might exist ( that is , a reader who denies the premises ) , and that he would hold that if a and b are true , then z must be true , while not yet accepting that a and b are true the tortoise then asks achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist , who accepts that a and b are true , but who does not yet accept the principle that if a and b are both true , then z must be true the tortoise , then , asks achilles to treat the tortoise as a reader of this second kind achilles must now logically compel the tortoise to accept that z must be true ( the tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself ; the syllogism 's conclusion , structure , or validity in propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows : p implies q if and only if the proposition not p or q is a tautology thus , if the solution is to be said to work , then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system , and not otherwise “ ‘ what the tortoise said to achilles ’ : lewis carroll 's paradox of inference

the tortoise then asks achilles whether there might be a reader of euclid who grants that the argument is logically valid , as a sequence , while denying that a and b are true the tortoise then asks achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist , who accepts that a and b are true , but who does not yet accept the principle that if a and b are both true , then z must be true the tortoise , then , asks achilles to treat the tortoise as a reader of this second kind achilles must now logically compel the tortoise to accept that z must be true ( the tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself ; the syllogism 's conclusion , structure , or validity that is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules ( consider for example , the constructivist 's rejection of the law of the excluded middle and the dialethist 's rejection of the law of noncontradiction ) hence de modo ponente , p ∧ ( p → q ) ⇒ q , is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated but the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon “ ‘ what the tortoise said to achilles ’ : lewis carroll 's paradox of inference

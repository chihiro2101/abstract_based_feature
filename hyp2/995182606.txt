the discussion begins by considering the following logical argument : a : '' things that are equal to the same are equal to each other '' ( a euclidean relation ) b : '' the two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same '' therefore , z : '' the two sides of this triangle are equal to each other '' the tortoise asks achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises , and achilles grants that it obviously does the tortoise then asks achilles whether there might be a reader of euclid who grants that the argument is logically valid , as a sequence , while denying that a and b are true achilles accepts that such a reader might exist ( that is , a reader who denies the premises ) , and that he would hold that if a and b are true , then z must be true , while not yet accepting that a and b are true the tortoise then asks achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist , who accepts that a and b are true , but who does not yet accept the principle that if a and b are both true , then z must be true achilles grants the tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist achilles must now logically compel the tortoise to accept that z must be true however , if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a rule of inference defined within the system , then it can be abided by simply by reasoning within the system likewise , a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system , and when a person reasons according to this formal system , he can not question or differ from these inference rules , but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system “ ‘ what the tortoise said to achilles ’ : lewis carroll 's paradox of inference

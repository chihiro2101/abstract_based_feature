the earliest english poetry the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation ; bede attributes this to cædmon ( fl 658 & ndash ; 680 ) , who was , according to legend , an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at whitby this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry it is possible to identify certain key moments , however dream of the rood was written before circa ad 700 , when excerpts were carved in runes on the ruthwell cross some poems on historical events , such as battle of brunanburh ( 937 ) and the battle of maldon ( 991 ) , appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question , and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence by and large , however , anglo-saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives , rather than its date of composition the most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries , known as the cædmon manuscript , the vercelli book , the exeter book , and the nowell codex other genres include much religious verse , from devotional works to biblical paraphrase ; elegies such as the wanderer , the seafarer , and the ruin ( often taken to be a description of the ruins of bath ) ; and numerous proverbs , riddles , and charms with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english while anglo-norman or latin was preferred for high culture , english literature by no means died out , and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language around the turn of the 13th century , layamon wrote his brut , based on wace 's 12th century anglo-norman epic of the same name ; layamon 's language is recognisably middle english , though his prosody shows a strong anglo-saxon influence remaining other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment , including a variety of romances and lyrics with time , the english language regained prestige , and in 1362 it replaced french and latin in parliament and courts of law the reputation of chaucer 's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him , though lydgate and skelton are widely studied a group of scottish writers arose who were formerly believed to be influenced by chaucer the main poets of this scottish group were robert henryson , william dunbar and gavin douglas a number of medieval poets had , as already noted , shown an interest in the ideas of aristotle and the writings of european renaissance precursors such as dante in addition , the writings of english humanists like thomas more and thomas elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an english audience three other factors in the establishment of the english renaissance were the reformation , counter reformation , and the opening of the era of english naval power and overseas exploration and expansion the establishment of the church of england in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life with a small number of exceptions , the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable the douglas aeneid was completed in 1513 and john skelton wrote poems that were transitional between the late medieval and renaissance styles thomas wyatt ( 1503–42 ) , one of the earliest english renaissance poets he was responsible for many innovations in english poetry , and alongside henry howard , earl of surrey ( 1516/1517–47 ) introduced the sonnet from italy into england in the early 16th century much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the italian poet petrarch , but he also wrote sonnets of his own petrarch 's sonnets consist of an '' octave '' , rhyming abba abba , followed , after a turn ( volta ) in the sense , by a sestet with various rhyme schemes ; however his poems never ended in a rhyming couplet the norton anthology of english literature : sixteenth/early seventeenth century , volume b , 2012 , p a wide range of elizabethan poets wrote songs , including nicholas grimald , thomas nashe and robert southwell virgil 's aeneid , thomas campion 's metrical experiments , and spenser 's shepheardes calender and plays like shakespeare 's antony and cleopatra are all examples of the influence of classicism on elizabethan poetry it remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from classical mythology ; shakespeare 's venus and adonis and the christopher marlowe/george chapman hero and leander are examples of this kind of work jacobean and caroline poetry : 1603–1660 english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser john milton ( 1608–74 ) is considered one of the greatest english poets , and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval among the important poems milton wrote during this period are l'allegro , 1631 ; il penseroso , 1634 ; comus ( a masque ) , 1638 ; and lycidas ( 1638 ) others include george herbert , thomas traherne , henry vaughan , andrew marvell , and richard crashaw john milton in his comus falls into this group john milton 's paradise lost ( 1667 ) , a story of fallen pride , was the first major poem to appear in england after the restoration the court of charles ii had , in its years in france , learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the republic one of the greatest english poets , john milton ( 1608–1674 ) , wrote during this period of religious and political instability some of milton 's important poems , were written before the restoration ( see above ) '' milton , john – introduction '' , contemporary literary criticism all the major poets of the period , samuel butler , john dryden , alexander pope and samuel johnson , and the irish poet jonathan swift , wrote satirical verse their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government not only did the poets aim for a polished high style in emulation of the roman ideal , they also translated and imitated greek and latin verse resulting in measured rationalised elegant verse notable poets later in the period include anna laetitia barbauld , joanna baillie , susanna blamire , felicia hemans , mary leapor , lady mary wortley montagu , hannah more , and mary robinson this trend can perhaps be most clearly seen in the handling of nature , with a move away from poems about formal gardens and landscapes by urban poets and towards poems about nature as lived in the leading exponents of this new trend include thomas gray , george crabbe , christopher smart and robert burns as well as the irish poet oliver goldsmith in shelley 's '' defense of poetry '' , he contends that poets are the '' creators of language '' and that the poet 's job is to refresh language for their society in the work of john clare the late augustan voice is blended with a peasant 's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the english language landor was a classicist whose poetry forms a link between the augustans and robert browning , who much admired it the victorian era was a period of great political , social and economic change this expansion , combined with increasing industrialisation and mechanisation , led to a prolonged period of economic growth no one has ever written more powerfully of nature , of a rural childhood , and of the alienated and unstable self '' as with the poets of the first world war , the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry the oxford companion to twentieth-century poetry in english ;

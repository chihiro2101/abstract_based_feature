the earliest english poetry the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation ; bede attributes this to cædmon ( fl 658 & ndash ; 680 ) , who was , according to legend , an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at whitby this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry see , for example , beowulf : a dual-language edition , doubleday , new york , ny , 1977 ; newton , s the origins of beowulf and the pre-viking kingdom of east anglia some poems on historical events , such as battle of brunanburh ( 937 ) and the battle of maldon ( 991 ) , appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question , and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence by and large , however , anglo-saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives , rather than its date of composition beowulf is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety , but fragments of others such as waldere and the finnesburg fragment show that it was not unique in its time with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment , including a variety of romances and lyrics with time , the english language regained prestige , and in 1362 it replaced french and latin in parliament and courts of law a group of scottish writers arose who were formerly believed to be influenced by chaucer the main poets of this scottish group were robert henryson , william dunbar and gavin douglas it is also generally accepted that the english renaissance extended until the restoration in 1660 a number of medieval poets had , as already noted , shown an interest in the ideas of aristotle and the writings of european renaissance precursors such as dante the introduction of movable-block printing by caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers caxton also printed the works of chaucer and gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its european counterparts the establishment of the church of england in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life at the same time , long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of nicolaus copernicus and johannes kepler with a small number of exceptions , the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable thomas wyatt ( 1503–42 ) , one of the earliest english renaissance poets he was responsible for many innovations in english poetry , and alongside henry howard , earl of surrey ( 1516/1517–47 ) introduced the sonnet from italy into england in the early 16th century much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the italian poet petrarch , but he also wrote sonnets of his own wyatt employs the petrarchan octave , but his most common sestet scheme is cddc ee this marks the beginnings of the english sonnet with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet campion is also notable because of his experiments with metres based on counting syllables rather than stresses with the consolidation of elizabeth 's power , a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged among the best known examples of this are edmund spenser 's the faerie queene , which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen , and philip sidney 's arcadia english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser however , the boundaries between these three groups are not always clear and an individual poet could write in more than one manner shakespeare also popularized the english sonnet , which made significant changes to petrarch 's model a collection of 154 sonnets by shakespeare , dealing with themes such as the passage of time , love , beauty , and mortality , were first published in a 1609 quarto john milton ( 1608–74 ) is considered one of the greatest english poets , and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his most renowned epic poems were written in the restoration period , including paradise lost ( 1667 ) the early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty , complicated style others include george herbert , thomas traherne , henry vaughan , andrew marvell , and richard crashaw the metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the victorian era the cavalier poets wrote in a lighter , more elegant and artificial style than the metaphysical poets they were an important group of writers , who came from the classes that supported king charles i during the wars of the three kingdoms ( 1639–51 ) they '' were not a formal group , but all were influenced '' by ben jonson john milton 's paradise lost ( 1667 ) , a story of fallen pride , was the first major poem to appear in england after the restoration one of the greatest english poets , john milton ( 1608–1674 ) , wrote during this period of religious and political instability his later major works include paradise regained , 1671 , and samson agonistes , 1671 milton 's works reflect deep personal convictions , a passion for freedom and self-determination , and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day '' milton , john – introduction '' , contemporary literary criticism their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government however , writers such as pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government the 18th century is sometimes called the augustan age , and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time women poets in the 18th century another contemporary poet who does not fit into the romantic group was walter savage landor dante rossetti worked with , and had some influence on , the leading arts and crafts painter and poet william morris morris shared the pre-raphaelite interest in the poetry of the european middle ages , to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work these poets turned to french models rather than either the new country poets or english-language modernism , and their works were a proof of the importance of later english experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the english avant-garde tradition the main movement in post-war 1940s poetry was the new romantic group that included dylan thomas , george barker , w thomas , in particular , helped anglo-welsh poetry to emerge as a recognisable force the oxford companion to twentieth-century poetry in english ;

the earliest english poetry the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation ; bede attributes this to cædmon ( fl this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date , or even to arrange chronologically ; for example , estimates for the date of the great epic beowulf range from ad 608 right through to ad 1000 , and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus see , for example , beowulf : a dual-language edition , doubleday , new york , ny , 1977 ; newton , s with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment , including a variety of romances and lyrics with time , the english language regained prestige , and in 1362 it replaced french and latin in parliament and courts of law the reputation of chaucer 's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him , though lydgate and skelton are widely studied it is also generally accepted that the english renaissance extended until the restoration in 1660 however , a number of factors had prepared the way for the introduction of the new learning long before this start date a number of medieval poets had , as already noted , shown an interest in the ideas of aristotle and the writings of european renaissance precursors such as dante the introduction of movable-block printing by caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers in addition , the writings of english humanists like thomas more and thomas elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an english audience three other factors in the establishment of the english renaissance were the reformation , counter reformation , and the opening of the era of english naval power and overseas exploration and expansion the establishment of the church of england in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life at the same time , long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of nicolaus copernicus and johannes kepler with a small number of exceptions , the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable the douglas aeneid was completed in 1513 and john skelton wrote poems that were transitional between the late medieval and renaissance styles the new king , henry viii , was something of a poet himself wyatt 's professed object was to experiment with the english tongue , to civilise it , to raise its powers to those of its neighbours much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the italian poet petrarch , but he also wrote sonnets of his own wyatt took subject matter from petrarch 's sonnets , but his rhyme schemes make a significant departure petrarch 's sonnets consist of an '' octave '' , rhyming abba abba , followed , after a turn ( volta ) in the sense , by a sestet with various rhyme schemes ; however his poems never ended in a rhyming couplet the norton anthology of english literature : sixteenth/early seventeenth century , volume b , 2012 , p a wide range of elizabethan poets wrote songs , including nicholas grimald , thomas nashe and robert southwell campion is also notable because of his experiments with metres based on counting syllables rather than stresses elizabethan poems and plays were often written in iambic meters , based on a metrical foot of two syllables , one unstressed and one stressed with the consolidation of elizabeth 's power , a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged this courtly trend can also be seen in spenser 's shepheardes calender this poem marks the introduction into an english context of the classical pastoral , a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants the explorations of love found in the sonnets of william shakespeare and the poetry of walter raleigh and others also implies a courtly audience it remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from classical mythology ; shakespeare 's venus and adonis and the christopher marlowe/george chapman hero and leander are examples of this kind of work english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser however , the boundaries between these three groups are not always clear and an individual poet could write in more than one manner shakespeare also popularized the english sonnet , which made significant changes to petrarch 's model a collection of 154 sonnets by shakespeare , dealing with themes such as the passage of time , love , beauty , and mortality , were first published in a 1609 quarto he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his most renowned epic poems were written in the restoration period , including paradise lost ( 1667 ) among the important poems milton wrote during this period are l'allegro , 1631 ; il penseroso , 1634 ; comus ( a masque ) , 1638 ; and lycidas ( 1638 ) others include george herbert , thomas traherne , henry vaughan , andrew marvell , and richard crashaw the metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the victorian era donne 's reputation was finally fully restored by the approbation of t influenced by continental baroque , and taking as his subject matter both christian mysticism and eroticism , donne 's metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or '' unpoetic '' figures , such as a compass or a mosquito , to reach surprise effects but the larger the distance , the more the hands of the compass lean to each other : separation makes love grow fonder the paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science , one that is no longer the centre of the universe the cavalier poets wrote in a lighter , more elegant and artificial style than the metaphysical poets they were an important group of writers , who came from the classes that supported king charles i during the wars of the three kingdoms ( 1639–51 ) leading members of the group include ben jonson , richard lovelace , robert herrick , edmund waller , thomas carew , sir john suckling , and john denham the cavalier poets can be seen as the forerunners of the major poets of the augustan era , who admired them greatly he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his major epic poems were written in the restoration period milton 's works reflect deep personal convictions , a passion for freedom and self-determination , and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day william hayley 's 1796 biography called him the '' greatest english author '' , mccalman 2001 , p and he remains generally regarded '' as one of the preeminent writers in the english language '' their work appeared in a series of five anthologies called georgian poetry which were published by harold monro and edited by edward marsh among the foremost avant-garde writers were the american-born poets gertrude stein , t as with the poets of the first world war , the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry the oxford companion to twentieth-century poetry in english ;

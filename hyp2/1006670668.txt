the earliest english poetry the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation ; bede attributes this to cædmon ( fl 658 & ndash ; 680 ) , who was , according to legend , an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at whitby this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry by and large , however , anglo-saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives , rather than its date of composition the most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries , known as the cædmon manuscript , the vercelli book , the exeter book , and the nowell codex beowulf is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety , but fragments of others such as waldere and the finnesburg fragment show that it was not unique in its time with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language while anglo-norman or latin was preferred for high culture , english literature by no means died out , and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment , including a variety of romances and lyrics the reputation of chaucer 's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him , though lydgate and skelton are widely studied the rise of scottish poetry began with the writing of the kingis quair by james i of scotland the main poets of this scottish group were robert henryson , william dunbar and gavin douglas a number of medieval poets had , as already noted , shown an interest in the ideas of aristotle and the writings of european renaissance precursors such as dante the introduction of movable-block printing by caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers caxton also printed the works of chaucer and gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its european counterparts in addition , the writings of english humanists like thomas more and thomas elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an english audience three other factors in the establishment of the english renaissance were the reformation , counter reformation , and the opening of the era of english naval power and overseas exploration and expansion the establishment of the church of england in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life with a small number of exceptions , the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable the douglas aeneid was completed in 1513 and john skelton wrote poems that were transitional between the late medieval and renaissance styles thomas wyatt ( 1503–42 ) , one of the earliest english renaissance poets he was responsible for many innovations in english poetry , and alongside henry howard , earl of surrey ( 1516/1517–47 ) introduced the sonnet from italy into england in the early 16th century much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the italian poet petrarch , but he also wrote sonnets of his own there are also a large number of extant anonymous songs from the period the songs were generally printed either in miscellanies or anthologies such as richard tottel 's 1557 songs and sonnets or in songbooks that included printed music to enable performance this poem marks the introduction into an english context of the classical pastoral , a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants the explorations of love found in the sonnets of william shakespeare and the poetry of walter raleigh and others also implies a courtly audience virgil 's aeneid , thomas campion 's metrical experiments , and spenser 's shepheardes calender and plays like shakespeare 's antony and cleopatra are all examples of the influence of classicism on elizabethan poetry it remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from classical mythology ; shakespeare 's venus and adonis and the christopher marlowe/george chapman hero and leander are examples of this kind of work translations of classical poetry also became more widespread , with the versions of ovid 's metamorphoses by arthur golding ( 1565 & ndash ; 67 ) and george sandys ( 1626 ) , and chapman 's translations of homer 's iliad ( 1611 ) and odyssey ( c.1615 ) , among the outstanding examples english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser shakespeare also popularized the english sonnet , which made significant changes to petrarch 's model he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his most renowned epic poems were written in the restoration period , including paradise lost ( 1667 ) among the important poems milton wrote during this period are l'allegro , 1631 ; il penseroso , 1634 ; comus ( a masque ) , 1638 ; and lycidas ( 1638 ) influenced by continental baroque , and taking as his subject matter both christian mysticism and eroticism , donne 's metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or '' unpoetic '' figures , such as a compass or a mosquito , to reach surprise effects for example , in '' valediction : forbidding mourning '' , one of donne 's songs and sonnets , the points of a compass represent two lovers , the woman who is home , waiting , being the centre , the farther point being her lover sailing away from her the paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science , one that is no longer the centre of the universe another important group of poets at this time were the cavalier poets they were an important group of writers , who came from the classes that supported king charles i during the wars of the three kingdoms ( 1639–51 ) the cavalier poets can be seen as the forerunners of the major poets of the augustan era , who admired them greatly cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions , and are influence by latin authors horace , cicero , and ovid john milton 's paradise lost ( 1667 ) , a story of fallen pride , was the first major poem to appear in england after the restoration one of the greatest english poets , john milton ( 1608–1674 ) , wrote during this period of religious and political instability he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his major epic poems were written in the restoration period william hayley 's 1796 biography called him the '' greatest english author '' , mccalman 2001 , p and he remains generally regarded '' as one of the preeminent writers in the english language '' all the major poets of the period , samuel butler , john dryden , alexander pope and samuel johnson , and the irish poet jonathan swift , wrote satirical verse however , writers such as pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government not only did the poets aim for a polished high style in emulation of the roman ideal , they also translated and imitated greek and latin verse resulting in measured rationalised elegant verse horace and juvenal were also widely translated and imitated , horace most famously by john wilmot , earl of rochester and juvenal by samuel johnson 's the vanity of human wishes these poets can be seen as paving the way for the romantic movement in the work of john clare the late augustan voice is blended with a peasant 's first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the english language housman ( 1859 – 1936 ) was poet who was born in the victorian era and who first published in the 1890s , but who only really became known in the 20th century betjeman was a quietly ironic poet of middle england , with a command of a wide range of verse techniques these last four poets represent a trend towards regionalism and poets writing about their native areas ; watkins and thomas in wales , nicholson in cumberland and maccaig in scotland a new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the revival grouping , notably caroline bergvall , tony lopez , allen fisher and denise riley throughout this period , and to the present , independent poetry presses such as enitharmon have continued to promote original work from ( among others ) dannie abse , martyn crucefix and jane duran

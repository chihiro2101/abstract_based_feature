the earliest english poetry the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation ; bede attributes this to cædmon ( fl 658 & ndash ; 680 ) , who was , according to legend , an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at whitby this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry it is possible to identify certain key moments , however by and large , however , anglo-saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives , rather than its date of composition the most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries , known as the cædmon manuscript , the vercelli book , the exeter book , and the nowell codex while the poetry that has survived is limited in volume , it is wide in breadth beowulf is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety , but fragments of others such as waldere and the finnesburg fragment show that it was not unique in its time other genres include much religious verse , from devotional works to biblical paraphrase ; elegies such as the wanderer , the seafarer , and the ruin ( often taken to be a description of the ruins of bath ) ; and numerous proverbs , riddles , and charms with one notable exception ( rhyming poem ) , anglo-saxon poetry depends on alliterative verse for its structure and any rhyme included is merely ornamental with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english around the turn of the 13th century , layamon wrote his brut , based on wace 's 12th century anglo-norman epic of the same name ; layamon 's language is recognisably middle english , though his prosody shows a strong anglo-saxon influence remaining with time , the english language regained prestige , and in 1362 it replaced french and latin in parliament and courts of law the reputation of chaucer 's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him , though lydgate and skelton are widely studied a group of scottish writers arose who were formerly believed to be influenced by chaucer the rise of scottish poetry began with the writing of the kingis quair by james i of scotland it is also generally accepted that the english renaissance extended until the restoration in 1660 the introduction of movable-block printing by caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers caxton also printed the works of chaucer and gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its european counterparts in addition , the writings of english humanists like thomas more and thomas elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an english audience three other factors in the establishment of the english renaissance were the reformation , counter reformation , and the opening of the era of english naval power and overseas exploration and expansion the establishment of the church of england in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life with a small number of exceptions , the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable the new king , henry viii , was something of a poet himself he was responsible for many innovations in english poetry , and alongside henry howard , earl of surrey ( 1516/1517–47 ) introduced the sonnet from italy into england in the early 16th century wyatt employs the petrarchan octave , but his most common sestet scheme is cddc ee this marks the beginnings of the english sonnet with 3 quatrains and a closing couplet elizabethan poems and plays were often written in iambic meters , based on a metrical foot of two syllables , one unstressed and one stressed however , much metrical experimentation took place during the period , and many of the songs , in particular , departed widely from the iambic norm with the consolidation of elizabeth 's power , a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged this encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at , and often set in , an idealised version of the courtly world among the best known examples of this are edmund spenser 's the faerie queene , which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen , and philip sidney 's arcadia this poem marks the introduction into an english context of the classical pastoral , a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants virgil 's aeneid , thomas campion 's metrical experiments , and spenser 's shepheardes calender and plays like shakespeare 's antony and cleopatra are all examples of the influence of classicism on elizabethan poetry translations of classical poetry also became more widespread , with the versions of ovid 's metamorphoses by arthur golding ( 1565 & ndash ; 67 ) and george sandys ( 1626 ) , and chapman 's translations of homer 's iliad ( 1611 ) and odyssey ( c.1615 ) , among the outstanding examples english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser a collection of 154 sonnets by shakespeare , dealing with themes such as the passage of time , love , beauty , and mortality , were first published in a 1609 quarto john milton ( 1608–74 ) is considered one of the greatest english poets , and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his most renowned epic poems were written in the restoration period , including paradise lost ( 1667 ) the early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty , complicated style others include george herbert , thomas traherne , henry vaughan , andrew marvell , and richard crashaw but the larger the distance , the more the hands of the compass lean to each other : separation makes love grow fonder the paradox or the oxymoron is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science , one that is no longer the centre of the universe leading members of the group include ben jonson , richard lovelace , robert herrick , edmund waller , thomas carew , sir john suckling , and john denham for example , robert herrick was not a courtier , but his style marks him as a cavalier poet . the restoration and 18th century john milton 's paradise lost ( 1667 ) , a story of fallen pride , was the first major poem to appear in england after the restoration william hayley 's 1796 biography called him the '' greatest english author '' , mccalman 2001 , p and he remains generally regarded '' as one of the preeminent writers in the english language '' all the major poets of the period , samuel butler , john dryden , alexander pope and samuel johnson , and the irish poet jonathan swift , wrote satirical verse however , writers such as pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government a number of women poets of note emerged during the period of the restoration , including aphra behn , margaret cavendish , mary chudleigh , anne finch , anne killigrew , and katherine philips mahatma gandhi 's passive resistance was influenced and inspired by shelley 's verse , and would often quote the poem to vast audiences the 1940s opened with the united kingdom at war and a new generation of war poets emerged in response the main movement in post-war 1940s poetry was the new romantic group that included dylan thomas , george barker , w the oxford companion to twentieth-century poetry in english ;

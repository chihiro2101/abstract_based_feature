the earliest english poetry the earliest known english poem is a hymn on the creation ; bede attributes this to cædmon ( fl 658 & ndash ; 680 ) , who was , according to legend , an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at whitby this is generally taken as marking the beginning of old english poetry much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date , or even to arrange chronologically ; for example , estimates for the date of the great epic beowulf range from ad 608 right through to ad 1000 , and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus ) , the ruthwell cross , princeton university press ( 1992 ) by and large , however , anglo-saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives , rather than its date of composition the most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late 10th and early 11th centuries , known as the cædmon manuscript , the vercelli book , the exeter book , and the nowell codex with one notable exception ( rhyming poem ) , anglo-saxon poetry depends on alliterative verse for its structure and any rhyme included is merely ornamental with the norman conquest of england , beginning in 1111 the anglo-saxon language rapidly diminished as a written literary language the new aristocracy spoke predominantly norman , and this became the standard language of courts , parliament , and polite society as the invaders integrated , their language and literature mingled with that of the natives : the oïl dialect of the upper classes became anglo-norman , and anglo-saxon underwent a gradual transition into middle english while anglo-norman or latin was preferred for high culture , english literature by no means died out , and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language the reputation of chaucer 's successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him , though lydgate and skelton are widely studied a group of scottish writers arose who were formerly believed to be influenced by chaucer the main poets of this scottish group were robert henryson , william dunbar and gavin douglas it is also generally accepted that the english renaissance extended until the restoration in 1660 however , a number of factors had prepared the way for the introduction of the new learning long before this start date the introduction of movable-block printing by caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers caxton also printed the works of chaucer and gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its european counterparts in addition , the writings of english humanists like thomas more and thomas elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an english audience three other factors in the establishment of the english renaissance were the reformation , counter reformation , and the opening of the era of english naval power and overseas exploration and expansion at the same time , long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of nicolaus copernicus and johannes kepler thomas wyatt ( 1503–42 ) , one of the earliest english renaissance poets much of his literary output consists of translations and imitations of sonnets by the italian poet petrarch , but he also wrote sonnets of his own the norton anthology of english literature : sixteenth/early seventeenth century , volume b , 2012 , p this encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at , and often set in , an idealised version of the courtly world among the best known examples of this are edmund spenser 's the faerie queene , which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen , and philip sidney 's arcadia english renaissance poetry after the elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains ; the metaphysical poets , the cavalier poets and the school of spenser shakespeare also popularized the english sonnet , which made significant changes to petrarch 's model a collection of 154 sonnets by shakespeare , dealing with themes such as the passage of time , love , beauty , and mortality , were first published in a 1609 quarto john milton ( 1608–74 ) is considered one of the greatest english poets , and wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval among the important poems milton wrote during this period are l'allegro , 1631 ; il penseroso , 1634 ; comus ( a masque ) , 1638 ; and lycidas ( 1638 ) the metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the victorian era eliot in the early 20th century but the larger the distance , the more the hands of the compass lean to each other : separation makes love grow fonder another important group of poets at this time were the cavalier poets they were an important group of writers , who came from the classes that supported king charles i during the wars of the three kingdoms ( 1639–51 ) ( king charles reigned from 1625 and was executed 1649 ) leading members of the group include ben jonson , richard lovelace , robert herrick , edmund waller , thomas carew , sir john suckling , and john denham for example , robert herrick was not a courtier , but his style marks him as a cavalier poet cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions , and are influence by latin authors horace , cicero , and ovid . the restoration and 18th century the court of charles ii had , in its years in france , learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the republic he is generally seen as the last major poet of the english renaissance , though his major epic poems were written in the restoration period some of milton 's important poems , were written before the restoration ( see above ) william hayley 's 1796 biography called him the '' greatest english author '' , mccalman 2001 , p and he remains generally regarded '' as one of the preeminent writers in the english language '' their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government the 18th century is sometimes called the augustan age , and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time not only did the poets aim for a polished high style in emulation of the roman ideal , they also translated and imitated greek and latin verse resulting in measured rationalised elegant verse dryden translated all the known works of virgil , and pope produced versions of the two homeric epics women poets in the 18th century towards the end of the 18th century , poetry began to move away from the strict augustan ideals and a new emphasis on the sentiment and feelings of the poet was established eliot , particularly after the publication of the waste land , became a major figure and influence on other english poets these poets turned to french models rather than either the new country poets or english-language modernism , and their works were a proof of the importance of later english experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the english avant-garde tradition the 1950s were dominated by three groups of poets , the movement , the group , and poets clarified by the term extremist art , which was first used by the poet a the oxford companion to twentieth-century poetry in english ;

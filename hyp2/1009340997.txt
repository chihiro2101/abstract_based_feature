filter paper has various properties by volume filtration the particles are caught in the bulk of the filter paper filter paper is mostly used because even a small piece of filter paper will absorb a significant volume of liquid the raw materials are different paper pulps most filter papers are made on small paper machines the filter papers are transformed into filter cartridges , which then is fitted to a holder the raw material for filter paper used in fuel filters are made of a mixture of hardwood and softwood fibres filter papers are widely used in laboratory experiments across many different fields , from biology to chemistry grade 1 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 11 & nbsp ; μm this grade of filter paper is widely used for many different fields in agricultural analysis , air pollution monitoring and other similar experiments grade 2 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 8 & nbsp ; μm grade 3 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 6 & nbsp ; μm this grade of filter paper has the largest pore size among all standard qualitative filter papers grade 602 h qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 2 & nbsp ; μm in addition , different types of glass fiber filter are suitable for different filtration situation

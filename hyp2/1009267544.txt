the introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as the advent of laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups : h√§nsch and schawlow , and wineland and dehmelt these early proposals for laser cooling only relied on '' scattering force '' , the name for the radiation pressure in later proposals , laser trapping , a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force , would be introduced the group wrote about experimentally demonstrating the cooling of atoms through a process using radiation pressure using the electromagnetic trap to contain the magnesium ions , they bombarded them with a laser barely out of phase from the resonant frequency of the atoms around this time , laser cooling techniques had allowed for temperatures lowered to around 40 kelvins laser cooling is primarily used to create ultracold atoms for experiments in quantum physics laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems researchers in laser cooling

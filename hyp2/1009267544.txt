the introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as the advent of laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups : hänsch and schawlow , and wineland and dehmelt '' in the paper by hänsch and schawlow , the effect of radiation pressure on any object that reflects light is described that concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas in later proposals , laser trapping , a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force , would be introduced the group wrote about experimentally demonstrating the cooling of atoms through a process using radiation pressure around this time , laser cooling techniques had allowed for temperatures lowered to around 40 kelvins doppler cooling , which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap , is by far the most common method of laser cooling laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems researchers in laser cooling

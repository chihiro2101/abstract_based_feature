laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups : h√§nsch and schawlow , and wineland and dehmelt they both outlined a process of slowing heat-based velocity in atoms by '' radiative forces that concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas these early proposals for laser cooling only relied on '' scattering force '' , the name for the radiation pressure in later proposals , laser trapping , a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force , would be introduced the group wrote about experimentally demonstrating the cooling of atoms through a process using radiation pressure doppler cooling , which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap , is by far the most common method of laser cooling it is used to cool low density gases down to the doppler cooling limit , which for rubidium-85 is around 150 microkelvins laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems researchers in laser cooling

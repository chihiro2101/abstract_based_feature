following that period , in 1933 , frisch exemplified the pressure exerted on atoms by light the introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as the advent of laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups : h√§nsch and schawlow , and wineland and dehmelt that concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas these early proposals for laser cooling only relied on '' scattering force '' , the name for the radiation pressure in the late 70s , ashkin described how radiation forces can be used to both optically trap atoms and simultaneously cool them the group wrote about experimentally demonstrating the cooling of atoms through a process using radiation pressure around this time , laser cooling techniques had allowed for temperatures lowered to around 40 kelvins doppler cooling , which is usually accompanied by a magnetic trapping force to give a magneto-optical trap , is by far the most common method of laser cooling laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems

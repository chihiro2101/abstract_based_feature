following that period , in 1933 , frisch exemplified the pressure exerted on atoms by light starting in the early 1970s , lasers were then utilized to further explore atom manipulation the introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as the advent of laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s '' in the paper by h√§nsch and schawlow , the effect of radiation pressure on any object that reflects light is described that concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas in later proposals , laser trapping , a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a dipole force , would be introduced around this time , laser cooling techniques had allowed for temperatures lowered to around 40 kelvins in doppler cooling , initially , the frequency of light is tuned slightly below an electronic transition in the atom laser cooling has primarily been used on atoms , but recent progress has been made toward laser cooling more complex systems researchers in laser cooling

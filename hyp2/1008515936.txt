english historian ronald hutton concurs with swedish scholar carl wilhelm von sydow who stated that maypoles were erected '' simply '' as '' signs that the happy season of warmth and comfort had returned '' their shape allowed for garlands to be hung from them and were first seen , at least in the british isles , between ad 1350 and 1400 within the context of medieval christian european culture chaucer mentions that a particularly large maypole stood at st andrew undershaft , which was collectively erected by church parishioners annually due to its large shape the symbolism of the maypole has been continuously debated by folklorists for centuries , although no definitive answer has been found the fact that they were found primarily in areas of germanic europe , where , prior to christianisation , germanic paganism was followed in various forms , has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a germanic pagan tradition one theory holds that they were a remnant of the germanic reverence for sacred trees , as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of germanic europe , including thor 's oak and the irminsul '' it is also known that , in norse paganism , cosmology views held that the universe was a world tree , known as yggdrasil phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later early modern period , as one sexual reference is in john cleland 's controversial novel fanny hill : and now , disengag 'd from the shirt , i saw , with wonder and surprise , what ? not the play-thing of a boy , not the weapon of a man , but a maypole of so enormous a standard , that had proportions been observ 'd , it must have belong 'd to a young giant ronald hutton has stated , however , that '' there is no historical basis for his claim , and no sign that the people who used maypoles thought that they were phallic '' and that '' they were not carved to appear so in this way , they bore similarities with the may day garlands which were also a common festival practice in britain and ireland grand master marc'antonio zondadari introduced the game of cockaigne ( with the use of the maypole ) to maltese carnival in 1721 : on a given signal , the crowd assembled in palace square converged on a collection of hams , sausages and live animals hidden beneath leafy branches outside the main guard it is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 may – in baden and swabia – or on the evening before , for example , in east frisia in most areas , especially in baden-württemberg , bavaria and austria , it is usual to have a ceremony to erect the maypole on the village green this tradition is especially strong in the villages of the bavarian alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 may in the village square is a cause for much celebration if a village manages to steal a maibaum , then the village the maibaum has been stolen from has to invite the whole village of the thieves to free beer and a festivity which then takes place on may 1 just before the maibaum is erected , depending on the region , there may be a procession through the village , usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band while the maypole is traditionally set up with the help of long poles , today it may sometime also be done using tractors , forklifts or even cranes these trees , which may reach five metres of height or more , are sold beforehand by local foresters the men usually decorate them with multicoloured crepe paper and often with a red heart of wood with the name of the girl written on it depending on local custom , the maibaum may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of may in denmark the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of avernakø and strynø south of funen and in a few villages in southern himmerland in eastern jutland the maypole is generally referred to as a majtræ , '' may tree '' in sweden and swedish speaking parts of finland , the maypole is usually called a midsummer pole , , as it appears at the midsummer celebrations , although the literal translation majstång also occurs , where the word maj refers to the old swedish word maja which means dress and not to the month of may for dressing a maypole , one of the last recorded examples of the rural festival of the first of may in scotland , having been put down by act of parliament immediately after the reformation in 1560 maypole traditions can be found in some parts of the country , e.g poet jonathan swift in his poem '' a maypole '' describes a maypole as : '' the may-pole of merry mount '' is a short story by nathaniel hawthorne in the 2019 psychological horror film midsommar , a maypole dance takes place with the winner being crowned the may queen

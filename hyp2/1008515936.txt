english historian ronald hutton concurs with swedish scholar carl wilhelm von sydow who stated that maypoles were erected '' simply '' as '' signs that the happy season of warmth and comfort had returned '' their shape allowed for garlands to be hung from them and were first seen , at least in the british isles , between ad 1350 and 1400 within the context of medieval christian european culture in 1588 , at holy trinity church in exeter , villagers gathered around the 'summer rod ' for feasting and drinking chaucer mentions that a particularly large maypole stood at st andrew undershaft , which was collectively erected by church parishioners annually due to its large shape the symbolism of the maypole has been continuously debated by folklorists for centuries , although no definitive answer has been found the fact that they were found primarily in areas of germanic europe , where , prior to christianisation , germanic paganism was followed in various forms , has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a germanic pagan tradition ronald hutton , however , states that '' there is absolutely no evidence that the maypole was regarded as a reflection of it some observers have proposed phallic symbolism , an idea which was expressed by thomas hobbes , who erroneously believed that the poles dated back to the roman worship of the god priapus phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later early modern period , as one sexual reference is in john cleland 's controversial novel fanny hill : and now , disengag 'd from the shirt , i saw , with wonder and surprise , what ? not the play-thing of a boy , not the weapon of a man , but a maypole of so enormous a standard , that had proportions been observ 'd , it must have belong 'd to a young giant ronald hutton has stated , however , that '' there is no historical basis for his claim , and no sign that the people who used maypoles thought that they were phallic '' and that '' they were not carved to appear so in this way , they bore similarities with the may day garlands which were also a common festival practice in britain and ireland it is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 may – in baden and swabia – or on the evening before , for example , in east frisia in most areas , especially in baden-württemberg , bavaria and austria , it is usual to have a ceremony to erect the maypole on the village green the custom of combining it with a village or town fete , that usually takes place on 30 april , 1 & nbsp ; may or at pentecost ( whitsun ) , is widespread this tradition is especially strong in the villages of the bavarian alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 may in the village square is a cause for much celebration if a village manages to steal a maibaum , then the village the maibaum has been stolen from has to invite the whole village of the thieves to free beer and a festivity which then takes place on may 1 just before the maibaum is erected , depending on the region , there may be a procession through the village , usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band while the crowds usually while away the time drinking beer and eating sausages , the young men busy themselves with decorating the maypole to get the symbols of various trades representing the region into the right position during the month of may , many house front gardens have such maypoles if the tree is erected on the eve of 1 may , then the event is usually followed by a may dance or tanz in den mai depending on local custom , the maibaum may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of may the traditions surrounding the maypoles vary locally , as does the design of the poles , although the design featuring a cross and two rings is most common nowadays under later english monarchs , the practice was sporadic , being banned in certain areas , such as doncaster , canterbury and bristol , but continuing in many others , according to the wishes of the local governors children would take these hand-held poles to school on may day morning and prizes may be awarded for the most impressive often the maypole dance will be accompanied by other dances as part of a presentation to the public governor bradford 's censure of the maypole tradition played a central role in nathaniel hawthorne 's fictional story '' the maypole of merry mount '' , 1837 in new westminster , british columbia , dancing around the may pole and may day celebrations have been held for 149 years

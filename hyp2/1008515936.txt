english historian ronald hutton concurs with swedish scholar carl wilhelm von sydow who stated that maypoles were erected '' simply '' as '' signs that the happy season of warmth and comfort had returned '' their shape allowed for garlands to be hung from them and were first seen , at least in the british isles , between ad 1350 and 1400 within the context of medieval christian european culture in 1588 , at holy trinity church in exeter , villagers gathered around the 'summer rod ' for feasting and drinking chaucer mentions that a particularly large maypole stood at st andrew undershaft , which was collectively erected by church parishioners annually due to its large shape the symbolism of the maypole has been continuously debated by folklorists for centuries , although no definitive answer has been found the fact that they were found primarily in areas of germanic europe , where , prior to christianisation , germanic paganism was followed in various forms , has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a germanic pagan tradition one theory holds that they were a remnant of the germanic reverence for sacred trees , as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of germanic europe , including thor 's oak and the irminsul ronald hutton , however , states that '' there is absolutely no evidence that the maypole was regarded as a reflection of it phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later early modern period , as one sexual reference is in john cleland 's controversial novel fanny hill : '' the anthropologist mircea eliade theorizes that the maypoles were simply a part of the general rejoicing at the return of summer , and the growth of new vegetation it is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 may – in baden and swabia – or on the evening before , for example , in east frisia the custom of combining it with a village or town fete , that usually takes place on 30 april , 1 & nbsp ; may or at pentecost ( whitsun ) , is widespread this tradition is especially strong in the villages of the bavarian alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 may in the village square is a cause for much celebration the young men from the villages try to steal the maibaum from an other , which is why the men of each village or city take turns in watching over the maibaum just before the maibaum is erected , depending on the region , there may be a procession through the village , usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band the men usually decorate them with multicoloured crepe paper and often with a red heart of wood with the name of the girl written on it depending on local custom , the maibaum may remain in place all year round or may be taken down at the end of may in denmark the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of avernakø and strynø south of funen and in a few villages in southern himmerland in eastern jutland the traditions surrounding the maypoles vary locally , as does the design of the poles , although the design featuring a cross and two rings is most common nowadays a perhaps more original incarnation is the one still in use in the swedish landscape of småland where the pole carries a large horizontally suspended ring around it , hanging from ropes attached at the top of the pole the cross-arm may be a latter-day attempt to christianize the pagan symbol into the semblance of a cross , although not completely successful the central part played by young children in the celebration emphasize the procreation aspect of the celebration yet another pointer in this direction is the custom that young maidens expect to dream of their future mate if they pick seven different flowers and place them under their pillow when they go to bed on this day only in 1974 however , a group of leuven men found out which tree was chosen by brussels as that year 's meyboom literary evidence for maypole use across much of britain increases in later decades , and '' by the period 1350-1400 the custom was well established across southern britain , in town and country and in both welsh-speaking and english-speaking areas liberty trees were erected in the southern part of the region in ripatransone and ascoli piceno in canada , maypole dances are sometimes done as part of victoria day celebrations which occur in may in the 2019 psychological horror film midsommar , a maypole dance takes place with the winner being crowned the may queen

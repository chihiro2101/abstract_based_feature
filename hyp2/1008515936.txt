chaucer mentions that a particularly large maypole stood at st andrew undershaft , which was collectively erected by church parishioners annually due to its large shape the symbolism of the maypole has been continuously debated by folklorists for centuries , although no definitive answer has been found the fact that they were found primarily in areas of germanic europe , where , prior to christianisation , germanic paganism was followed in various forms , has led to speculation by some that the maypoles were in some way a relic of a germanic pagan tradition one theory holds that they were a remnant of the germanic reverence for sacred trees , as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of germanic europe , including thor 's oak and the irminsul some observers have proposed phallic symbolism , an idea which was expressed by thomas hobbes , who erroneously believed that the poles dated back to the roman worship of the god priapus phallic symbolism has been attributed to the maypole in the later early modern period , as one sexual reference is in john cleland 's controversial novel fanny hill : and now , disengag 'd from the shirt , i saw , with wonder and surprise , what ? not the play-thing of a boy , not the weapon of a man , but a maypole of so enormous a standard , that had proportions been observ 'd , it must have belong 'd to a young giant '' the anthropologist mircea eliade theorizes that the maypoles were simply a part of the general rejoicing at the return of summer , and the growth of new vegetation in this way , they bore similarities with the may day garlands which were also a common festival practice in britain and ireland it is a decorated tree or tree trunk that is usually erected either on 1 may – in baden and swabia – or on the evening before , for example , in east frisia the custom of combining it with a village or town fete , that usually takes place on 30 april , 1 & nbsp ; may or at pentecost ( whitsun ) , is widespread this tradition is especially strong in the villages of the bavarian alps where the raising of the traditional maypole on 1 may in the village square is a cause for much celebration in bavaria the maibaum is erected several weeks before may 1 the young men from the villages try to steal the maibaum from an other , which is why the men of each village or city take turns in watching over the maibaum just before the maibaum is erected , depending on the region , there may be a procession through the village , usually ending up at a central place and/or restaurant and usually watched by crowds of spectators and accompanied by a brass band while the maypole is traditionally set up with the help of long poles , today it may sometime also be done using tractors , forklifts or even cranes during the night before 1 may , unmarried men erect young birch trees in front of the houses of their sweethearts these trees , which may reach five metres of height or more , are sold beforehand by local foresters the men usually decorate them with multicoloured crepe paper and often with a red heart of wood with the name of the girl written on it if the tree is erected on the eve of 1 may , then the event is usually followed by a may dance or tanz in den mai in denmark the maypole tradition is almost extinct but is still observed on the islands of avernakø and strynø south of funen and in a few villages in southern himmerland in eastern jutland it is also customary , mostly in the dutch-speaking region of belgium , to place a branch ( also called a meiboom ) on the highest point of a building under construction however , they are certain that the prohibition turned maypole dancing into a symbol of resistance to the long parliament and to the republic that followed it however , the maypole remained an anti-religious symbol to some theologians , as shown by '' the two babylons '' , an anti-catholic conspiracist pamphlet that first appeared in 1853 governor bradford 's censure of the maypole tradition played a central role in nathaniel hawthorne 's fictional story '' the maypole of merry mount '' , 1837 around the maypole , quarters and hamlets give feasts with music , food and alcohol which usually last until the dawn of the 1st of may poet jonathan swift in his poem '' a maypole '' describes a maypole as : '' the may-pole of merry mount '' is a short story by nathaniel hawthorne in the 2019 psychological horror film midsommar , a maypole dance takes place with the winner being crowned the may queen

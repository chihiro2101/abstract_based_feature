barnacles are encrusters , attaching themselves temporarily to a hard substrate the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace the plates are held together by various means , depending on species , in some cases being solidly fused barnacles have no true heart , although a sinus close to the esophagus performs a similar function , with blood being pumped through it by a series of muscles the adult also has three photoreceptors ( ocelli ) , one median and two lateral barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult nauplii are typically initially brooded by the parent , and released after the first moult as larvae that swim freely using setae the cyprid larva is the last larval stage before adulthood once metamorphosis is over and they have reached their adult form , barnacles continue to grow by adding new material to their heavily calcified plates self-fertilization , although theoretically possible , has been experimentally shown to be rare in barnacles most barnacles are suspension feeders ; they dwell continually in their shells , which are usually constructed of six plates , and reach into the water column with modified legs although they have been found at water depths to , most barnacles inhabit shallow waters , with 75 % of species living in water depths less than , and 25 % inhabiting the intertidal zone since the intertidal zone periodically desiccates , barnacles are well adapted against water loss competitors may include other barnacles , and disputed evidence indicates balanoid barnacles competitively displaced chthalamoid barnacles some barnacles are considered edible by humans , including japanese goose barnacles ( e.g barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .

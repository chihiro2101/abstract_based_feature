barnacles are encrusters , attaching themselves temporarily to a hard substrate the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace adult barnacles have few appendages on their heads , with only a single , vestigial pair of antennae , attached to the cement gland the eight pairs of thoracic limbs are referred to as '' cirre '' , which are feathery and very long , being used to filter food , such as plankton , from the water and move it towards the mouth the main sense of barnacles appears to be touch , with the hairs on the limbs being especially sensitive barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult it is not a feeding stage ; its role is to find a suitable place to settle , since the adults are sessile typical acorn barnacles develop six hard calcareous plates to surround and protect their bodies once metamorphosis is over and they have reached their adult form , barnacles continue to grow by adding new material to their heavily calcified plates self-fertilization , although theoretically possible , has been experimentally shown to be rare in barnacles to facilitate genetic transfer between isolated individuals , barnacles have extraordinarily long penises‚Å† barnacles probably have the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom , up to eight times their body length the rhizocephala superorder used to be considered hermaphroditic , but it turned out that its males inject themselves into the female 's body , degrading to the condition of nothing more than sperm-producing cells competitors may include other barnacles , and disputed evidence indicates balanoid barnacles competitively displaced chthalamoid barnacles ( miocene ) showing internal plates in bioimmured smaller barnacles the anatomy of parasitic barnacles is generally simpler than that of their free-living relatives barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .

barnacles are encrusters , attaching themselves temporarily to a hard substrate the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace adult barnacles have few appendages on their heads , with only a single , vestigial pair of antennae , attached to the cement gland the main sense of barnacles appears to be touch , with the hairs on the limbs being especially sensitive these photoreceptors record the stimulus for the barnacle shadow reflex , where a sudden decrease in light causes cessation of the fishing rhythm and closing of the opercular plates barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult nauplii are typically initially brooded by the parent , and released after the first moult as larvae that swim freely using setae larvae assess surfaces based upon their surface texture , chemistry , relative wettability , color , and the presence or absence and composition of a surface biofilm ; swarming species are also more likely to attach near other barnacles typical acorn barnacles develop six hard calcareous plates to surround and protect their bodies self-fertilization , although theoretically possible , has been experimentally shown to be rare in barnacles the sessile lifestyle of barnacles makes sexual reproduction difficult , as the organisms can not leave their shells to mate barnacles probably have the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom , up to eight times their body length barnacles can also reproduce through a method called spermcasting , in which the male barnacle releases his sperm into the water and females pick it up and fertilise their eggs although they have been found at water depths to , most barnacles inhabit shallow waters , with 75 % of species living in water depths less than , and 25 % inhabiting the intertidal zone since the intertidal zone periodically desiccates , barnacles are well adapted against water loss ( miocene ) showing internal plates in bioimmured smaller barnacles the anatomy of parasitic barnacles is generally simpler than that of their free-living relatives barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .

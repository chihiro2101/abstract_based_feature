the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace the plates are held together by various means , depending on species , in some cases being solidly fused adult barnacles have few appendages on their heads , with only a single , vestigial pair of antennae , attached to the cement gland the eight pairs of thoracic limbs are referred to as '' cirre '' , which are feathery and very long , being used to filter food , such as plankton , from the water and move it towards the mouth these photoreceptors record the stimulus for the barnacle shadow reflex , where a sudden decrease in light causes cessation of the fishing rhythm and closing of the opercular plates barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult nauplii are typically initially brooded by the parent , and released after the first moult as larvae that swim freely using setae once metamorphosis is over and they have reached their adult form , barnacles continue to grow by adding new material to their heavily calcified plates these plates are not ecdysis ; however , like all ecdysozoans , the barnacle itself will still moult its cuticle self-fertilization , although theoretically possible , has been experimentally shown to be rare in barnacles the sessile lifestyle of barnacles makes sexual reproduction difficult , as the organisms can not leave their shells to mate barnacles can also reproduce through a method called spermcasting , in which the male barnacle releases his sperm into the water and females pick it up and fertilise their eggs the rhizocephala superorder used to be considered hermaphroditic , but it turned out that its males inject themselves into the female 's body , degrading to the condition of nothing more than sperm-producing cells for example , members of the superorder rhizocephala , including the genus sacculina , are parasitic and live within crabs competitors may include other barnacles , and disputed evidence indicates balanoid barnacles competitively displaced chthalamoid barnacles fortunately , this is not a problem for boats on inland waterways , as barnacles are exclusively marine barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .

barnacles are encrusters , attaching themselves temporarily to a hard substrate the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace adult barnacles have few appendages on their heads , with only a single , vestigial pair of antennae , attached to the cement gland barnacles have no true heart , although a sinus close to the esophagus performs a similar function , with blood being pumped through it by a series of muscles these photoreceptors record the stimulus for the barnacle shadow reflex , where a sudden decrease in light causes cessation of the fishing rhythm and closing of the opercular plates barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult it cements itself permanently to the substrate with another proteinaceous compound , and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle typical acorn barnacles develop six hard calcareous plates to surround and protect their bodies most barnacles are hermaphrodite , although a few species are gonochoric or androdioecy most barnacles are suspension feeders ; they dwell continually in their shells , which are usually constructed of six plates , and reach into the water column with modified legs although they have been found at water depths to , most barnacles inhabit shallow waters , with 75 % of species living in water depths less than , and 25 % inhabiting the intertidal zone competitors may include other barnacles , and disputed evidence indicates balanoid barnacles competitively displaced chthalamoid barnacles barnacles were originally classified by linnaeus and cuvier as mollusca , but in 1830 john vaughan thompson published observations showing the metamorphosis of the nauplius and cypris larvae into adult barnacles , and noted how these larvae were similar to those of crustaceans some barnacles are considered edible by humans , including japanese goose barnacles ( e.g the resemblance of this barnacle 's fleshy stalk to a goose 's neck gave rise , in ancient times , to the notion that geese literally grew from the barnacle barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .

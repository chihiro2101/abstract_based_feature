barnacles are encrusters , attaching themselves temporarily to a hard substrate the most common , '' acorn barnacles '' ( sessilia ) , are sessile , growing their shells directly onto the substrate the order pedunculata ( goose barnacles and others ) attach themselves by means of a stalk free-living barnacles are attached to the substratum by cement glands that form the base of the first pair of antennae ; in effect , the animal is fixed upside down by means of its forehead in some barnacles , the cement glands are fixed to a long , muscular stalk , but in most they are part of a flat membrane or calcified plate these consist of the rostrum , two lateral plates , two carinolaterals , and a carina in sessile barnacles , the apex of the ring of plates is covered by an operculum , which may be recessed into the carapace barnacles have two distinct larval stages , the nauplius and the cyprid , before developing into a mature adult it cements itself permanently to the substrate with another proteinaceous compound , and then undergoes metamorphosis into a juvenile barnacle typical acorn barnacles develop six hard calcareous plates to surround and protect their bodies most barnacles are hermaphrodite , although a few species are gonochoric or androdioecy the sessile lifestyle of barnacles makes sexual reproduction difficult , as the organisms can not leave their shells to mate barnacles probably have the largest penis to body size ratio of the animal kingdom , up to eight times their body length barnacles can also reproduce through a method called spermcasting , in which the male barnacle releases his sperm into the water and females pick it up and fertilise their eggs for example , members of the superorder rhizocephala , including the genus sacculina , are parasitic and live within crabs competitors may include other barnacles , and disputed evidence indicates balanoid barnacles competitively displaced chthalamoid barnacles the geological history of barnacles can be traced back to animals such as priscansermarinus from the middle cambrian ( on the order of , in refsouthward some barnacles are considered edible by humans , including japanese goose barnacles ( e.g capitulum mitella ) , and goose barnacles ( e.g barnacles from the marine education society of australasia barnacles in spain article on barnacles in spain , and their collection and gastronomy .

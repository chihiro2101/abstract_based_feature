when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for this reason , it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one 's speech is lost a double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps , and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker there is n't no other way ! there 's some other way ! these two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech any assumption would be correct , and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out ; thereby rendering the sentence 's meaning ambiguous since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative , the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence in light of punctuation , the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier ; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' this is opposed to the single negative '' i do n't agree '' , which typically means '' i disagree '' with the meaning '' i completely agree '' , lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out however , the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work , which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished because of this ambiguity , double negatives are frequently employed when making back-handed compliments jones was n't incompetent discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation indeed , they were used in middle english for example : i did n't go nowhere today we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb indeed , the word 'nowhere ' is thus being used as an adverb and does not negate the argument of the sentence double negatives such as i do n't want to know no more contrast with romance languages such as french in je ne veux pas savoir see the article regarding romance languages explaining this form of double negation then what happens is that the verb to doubt becomes intensified , which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive where people think that the sentence i 'm not hungry no more resolves to a positive is where the latter negative no becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart more which effectively becomes a noun , instead of an adverb another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g philosophies aside , this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor ' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what is n't to be opponents of double negatives would have preferred i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism or existentialism ; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence double negatives continue to be spoken by those of vernacular english , such as those of appalachian english and african american vernacular english this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time english after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics the use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical robert lowth stated in his grammar textbook a short introduction to english grammar ( 1762 ) that '' two negatives in english destroy one another , or are equivalent to an affirmative '' grammarians have assumed that latin was the model for lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord , as latin does not feature it data indicates , however , that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in standard english by the time of lowth 's grammar , and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism , which was well established by the time it appeared double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows in the film mary poppins ( 1964 ) , the chimney sweep bert employs a double negative when he says , '' if you do n't wan na go nowhere other examples include never say never ( chaka khan ) ai n't nobody ( bill withers ) , ai n't no sunshine ( marvin gaye ) , and ai n't no mountain high enough ( '' i never see you '' ) afrikaans shares with english the property that two negatives make a positive in the same way , umquam means '' ever '' , numquam means '' never '' , non.numquam ( nonnumquam ) means '' sometimes '' in italian , a second following negative particle non turns the phrase into a positive one , but with a slightly different meaning in czech , like in many other languages , a standard double negative is used in sentences with a negative pronoun or negative conjunction , where the verb is also negated ( '' nikdo nepřišel '' '' nobody came '' , literally '' nobody did n't come '' ) the sentence '' nemohu se nikdy neoddávat nečinnosti '' ( '' i ca n't never not indulge in inaction '' ) contains 4 negations and it is very confusing which of them create a '' double negative '' and which of them eliminated from each other double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech , while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning

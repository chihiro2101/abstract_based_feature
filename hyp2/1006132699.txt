two negatives resolving to a positive when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for this reason , it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one 's speech is lost negative : is n't ( is not ) , no vs there is n't no other way ! there 's some other way ! these two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech any assumption would be correct , and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out ; thereby rendering the sentence 's meaning ambiguous since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative , the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence in light of punctuation , the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier ; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' however , the statement '' i do n't completely disagree '' is a similar double negative to '' i do n't disagree '' but needs little or no clarification however , the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work , which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished jones was very competent '' since the speaker would 've found a more flattering way to say so discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as southern american english , african american vernacular english , and various british regional dialects indeed , they were used in middle english about the knight , '' he nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / in all his lyf unto no maner wight '' ( '' he never yet no vileness did n't say / in all his life to no manner of man '' ) you do n't know nothing we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives if a verb is present between the two , the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb double negatives such as i do n't want to know no more contrast with romance languages such as french in je ne veux pas savoir see the article regarding romance languages explaining this form of double negation two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer the last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive had we added an adverb thus : i have no doubt never this sentence is false the same applies to the third example , where the adverb 'more ' merges with the prefix no- to become a negative word , which when combined with the sentence 's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb hungry another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g philosophies aside , this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor ' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what is n't to be this form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative to such speakers , they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives researchers have studied african american vernacular english ( aave ) and trace its origins back to colonial english this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time english after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics the use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical grammarians have assumed that latin was the model for lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord , as latin does not feature it in the film mary poppins ( 1964 ) , the chimney sweep bert employs a double negative when he says , '' if you do n't wan na go nowhere '' ) another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a '' double negative '' but simply a grammatical template for negation it is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded nie , meaning '' not '' , through historical accident other romance languages employ double negatives less regularly meanwhile , a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation : μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ( '' do not permit no one to raise an uproar '' ) means '' let not a single one among them raise an uproar '' negating the verb without negating the pronoun ( or vice versa ) , while syntactically correct , may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech , while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning

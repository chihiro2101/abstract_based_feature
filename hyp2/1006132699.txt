two negatives resolving to a positive when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for this reason , it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one 's speech is lost a double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps , and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker any assumption would be correct , and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out ; thereby rendering the sentence 's meaning ambiguous since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative , the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence in light of punctuation , the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier ; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive this rule was observed as early as 1762 , when bishop robert lowth wrote a short introduction to english grammar with critical notes for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' however , the statement '' i do n't completely disagree '' is a similar double negative to '' i do n't disagree '' but needs little or no clarification with the meaning '' i completely agree '' , lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out jones was very competent '' since the speaker would 've found a more flattering way to say so following the battle of marston moor , oliver cromwell quoted his nephew 's dying words in a letter to the boy 's father valentine walton : '' a little after , he said one thing lay upon his spirit in contrast , some double negatives become positives : i did n't not go to the park today if a verb is present between the two , the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb indeed , the word 'nowhere ' is thus being used as an adverb and does not negate the argument of the sentence double negatives such as i do n't want to know no more contrast with romance languages such as french in je ne veux pas savoir a sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives , such as those prescribed in the later examples , where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer this is because the verb 'to doubt ' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive had we added an adverb thus : i have no doubt never this sentence is false where people think that the sentence i 'm not hungry no more resolves to a positive is where the latter negative no becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart more which effectively becomes a noun , instead of an adverb another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g other forms of double negatives , which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it , are described thus : : i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism nor existentialism philosophies aside , this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor ' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what is n't to be opponents of double negatives would have preferred i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism or existentialism ; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence this form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative up to the 18th century , double negatives were used to emphasize negation double negatives continue to be spoken by those of vernacular english , such as those of appalachian english and african american vernacular english this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time english after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics grammarians have assumed that latin was the model for lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord , as latin does not feature it data indicates , however , that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in standard english by the time of lowth 's grammar , and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism , which was well established by the time it appeared in the film mary poppins ( 1964 ) , the chimney sweep bert employs a double negative when he says , '' if you do n't wan na go nowhere '' another is used by the bandits in the '' stinking badges '' scene of john huston 's the treasure of the sierra madre ( 1948 ) : '' badges ? we ai n't got no badges its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by bruce donaldson : ek het nie geweet dat hy sou kom nie in northern catalan , no may be omitted in colloquial language , and occitan , which uses non only as a short answer to questions indeed , if a sentence contains a negated verb , any indefinite pronouns or adverbs must be used in their negative forms the sentence '' nemohu se nikdy neoddávat nečinnosti '' ( '' i ca n't never not indulge in inaction '' ) contains 4 negations and it is very confusing which of them create a '' double negative '' and which of them eliminated from each other negative verb forms are grammatically required in turkish phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase old english ic ne seah '' i did n't see '' > > middle english i ne saugh nawiht , lit

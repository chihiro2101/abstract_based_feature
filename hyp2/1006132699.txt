when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for this reason , it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one 's speech is lost a double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps , and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker there is n't no other way ! there 's some other way ! these two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative , the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive this rule was observed as early as 1762 , when bishop robert lowth wrote a short introduction to english grammar with critical notes for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' with the meaning '' i completely agree '' , lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out however , the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work , which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished because of this ambiguity , double negatives are frequently employed when making back-handed compliments discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation historically , chaucer made extensive use of double , triple , and even quadruple negatives in his canterbury tales following the battle of marston moor , oliver cromwell quoted his nephew 's dying words in a letter to the boy 's father valentine walton : '' a little after , he said one thing lay upon his spirit we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb double negatives such as i do n't want to know no more contrast with romance languages such as french in je ne veux pas savoir two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer the last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive then what happens is that the verb to doubt becomes intensified , which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g other forms of double negatives , which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it , are described thus : : i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism nor existentialism philosophies aside , this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor ' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what is n't to be opponents of double negatives would have preferred i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism or existentialism ; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence up to the 18th century , double negatives were used to emphasize negation '' prescriptive grammarians '' recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s double negatives continue to be spoken by those of vernacular english , such as those of appalachian english and african american vernacular english this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time the use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical in his essay towards a practical english grammar of 1711 , james greenwood first recorded the rule : '' two negatives , or two adverbs of denying do in english affirm '' robert lowth stated in his grammar textbook a short introduction to english grammar ( 1762 ) that '' two negatives in english destroy one another , or are equivalent to an affirmative '' data indicates , however , that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in standard english by the time of lowth 's grammar , and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism , which was well established by the time it appeared in the film mary poppins ( 1964 ) , the chimney sweep bert employs a double negative when he says , '' if you do n't wan na go nowhere '' another is used by the bandits in the '' stinking badges '' scene of john huston 's the treasure of the sierra madre ( 1948 ) : '' badges ? we ai n't got no badges '' the simpsons episode '' hello gutter , hello fadder '' ( 1999 ) features bart writing '' i wo n't not use no double negatives '' ( pictured ) as part of the opening sequence chalkboard gag other examples include never say never ( chaka khan ) ai n't nobody ( bill withers ) , ai n't no sunshine ( marvin gaye ) , and ai n't no mountain high enough its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by bruce donaldson : ek het nie geweet dat hy sou kom nie in italian , a second following negative particle non turns the phrase into a positive one , but with a slightly different meaning an exception to that rule is the ( archaic ) pronoun ουδείς , also meaning '' no one '' , which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs for instance , a statement '' i have not ever owed anything to anyone '' would be rendered as es nekad nevienam neko neesmu bijis parādā something superficially resembling double negation is required also in finnish , which uses the auxiliary verb ei to express negation for example , hiçbir şeyim yok ( literally , word for word , '' not-one thing-of-mine exists-not '' ) means '' i do n't have anything '' double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech , while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning

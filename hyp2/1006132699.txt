when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence any assumption would be correct , and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out ; thereby rendering the sentence 's meaning ambiguous since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative , the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended however , the statement '' i do n't completely disagree '' is a similar double negative to '' i do n't disagree '' but needs little or no clarification with the meaning '' i completely agree '' , lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out however , the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work , which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished jones was n't incompetent jones was very competent '' since the speaker would 've found a more flattering way to say so two or more negatives resolving to a negative discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation historically , chaucer made extensive use of double , triple , and even quadruple negatives in his canterbury tales whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive , in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives if a verb is present between the two , the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb double negatives such as i do n't want to know no more contrast with romance languages such as french in je ne veux pas savoir see the article regarding romance languages explaining this form of double negation the same applies to the third example , where the adverb 'more ' merges with the prefix no- to become a negative word , which when combined with the sentence 's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb hungry another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g other forms of double negatives , which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it , are described thus : : i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism nor existentialism philosophies aside , this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor ' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what is n't to be opponents of double negatives would have preferred i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism or existentialism ; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence up to the 18th century , double negatives were used to emphasize negation to such speakers , they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives researchers have studied african american vernacular english ( aave ) and trace its origins back to colonial english this shows that double negatives were present in colonial english , and thus presumably english as a whole , and were acceptable at that time in his essay towards a practical english grammar of 1711 , james greenwood first recorded the rule : '' two negatives , or two adverbs of denying do in english affirm '' robert lowth stated in his grammar textbook a short introduction to english grammar ( 1762 ) that '' two negatives in english destroy one another , or are equivalent to an affirmative '' data indicates , however , that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in standard english by the time of lowth 's grammar , and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism , which was well established by the time it appeared other examples include never say never ( chaka khan ) ai n't nobody ( bill withers ) , ai n't no sunshine ( marvin gaye ) , and ai n't no mountain high enough double negation is uncommon in other west germanic languages a notable exception is afrikaans , where it is mandatory ( for example , '' he can not speak afrikaans '' becomes hy kan nie afrikaans praat nie , '' he can not afrikaans speak not '' ) its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by bruce donaldson : ek het nie geweet dat hy sou kom nie '' ) another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a '' double negative '' but simply a grammatical template for negation the second nie is used if and only if the sentence or phrase does not already end with nie or another negating adverb similar to some dialectal english , bavarian employs both single and double negation , with the latter denoting special emphasis this is not usually regarded as three negative markers , however , because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word as with most synthetic satem languages double negative is mandatory in latvian and lithuanian for instance , a statement '' i have not ever owed anything to anyone '' would be rendered as es nekad nevienam neko neesmu bijis parādā double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech , while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning old english ic ne seah '' i did n't see '' > > middle english i ne saugh nawiht , lit

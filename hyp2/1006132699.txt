two negatives resolving to a positive when two negatives are used in one independent clause , in standard english the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative ( see the robert lowth citation below ) : this is known as litotes however , depending on how such a sentence is constructed , in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence for this reason , it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one 's speech is lost any assumption would be correct , and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out ; thereby rendering the sentence 's meaning ambiguous since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative , the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence -- > in standard english , two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive this rule was observed as early as 1762 , when bishop robert lowth wrote a short introduction to english grammar with critical notes for instance , '' i do n't disagree '' could mean '' i certainly agree '' , '' i agree '' , '' i sort of agree '' , '' i do n't understand your point of view ( pov ) '' , '' i have no opinion '' , and so on ; it is a form of '' weasel words '' however , the statement '' i do n't completely disagree '' is a similar double negative to '' i do n't disagree '' but needs little or no clarification with the meaning '' i completely agree '' , lowth would have been referring to litotes wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out however , the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work , which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished two or more negatives resolving to a negative discussing english grammar , the term '' double negative '' is often , though not universally , applied to the non-standard use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as southern american english , african american vernacular english , and various british regional dialects about the knight , '' he nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / in all his lyf unto no maner wight '' ( '' he never yet no vileness did n't say / in all his life to no manner of man '' ) for example : i did n't go nowhere today in contrast , some double negatives become positives : i did n't not go to the park today we ca n't not go to sleep ! the key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives in the first example , the verb to go separates the two negatives ; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb see the article regarding romance languages explaining this form of double negation a sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives , such as those prescribed in the later examples , where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it the same applies to the third example , where the adverb 'more ' merges with the prefix no- to become a negative word , which when combined with the sentence 's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb hungry another argument used to support the position double negatives are n't acceptable is a mathematical analogy : negating a negative number results in a positive one ; e.g philosophies aside , this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor ' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what is n't to be opponents of double negatives would have preferred i 'm not entirely familiar with nihilism or existentialism ; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence this form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative double negatives continue to be spoken by those of vernacular english , such as those of appalachian english and african american vernacular english to such speakers , they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives researchers have studied african american vernacular english ( aave ) and trace its origins back to colonial english grammarians have assumed that latin was the model for lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord , as latin does not feature it more recently , the british television show eastenders has received some publicity over the estuary accent of character dot branning , who speaks with double and triple negatives ( '' i ai n't never heard of no licence in the harry enfield sketch '' mr cholmondley-warner 's guide to the working-class '' , a stereotypical cockney employs a septuple-negative : '' inside toilet ? i ai n't never not heard of one of them nor i ai n't nor nothing double negation is uncommon in other west germanic languages its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by bruce donaldson : ek het nie geweet dat hy sou kom nie ( '' i never see you '' ) afrikaans shares with english the property that two negatives make a positive ) while double negation is still found in the low franconian dialects of west flanders ( e.g in belgian dutch dialects , however , there are still some widely used expressions like nooit niet ( '' never not '' ) for '' never '' the german emphatic '' niemals ! '' ( roughly '' never ever '' ) corresponds to bavarian '' ( går ) nia ned '' or even '' nie nicht '' in standard german pronunciation jamais , rien , personne and nulle part ( never , nothing , no one , nowhere ) can be mixed with each other , and/or with ne.plus ( not anymore/not again ) in french , e.g meanwhile , a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation : μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ( '' do not permit no one to raise an uproar '' ) means '' let not a single one among them raise an uproar '' the sentence '' nemohu se nikdy neoddávat nečinnosti '' ( '' i ca n't never not indulge in inaction '' ) contains 4 negations and it is very confusing which of them create a '' double negative '' and which of them eliminated from each other furthermore , all verbs and indefinite pronouns in a given statement must be negated , so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in latvian old english ic ne seah '' i did n't see '' > > middle english i ne saugh nawiht , lit

unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia does n't have song lyrics , poetry , or fiction either ; it 's not a primary-source repository be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated and relatively anarchic , rather than having moderation imposed upon it we do n't have a voting system or experience measure & mdash ; be assured that wikipedia : wikipediholic without it moving content from e2 to wikipedia you can move any of your own e2 writeups to wikipedia for other noders ' writeups , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) content needs to be converted from e2 markup to wiki markup wikipedia titles are generally shorter , so phrases like '' how to '' should be removed , and most titles should only have lower-case letters in fact , wikipedia has tags that can be used to enclose a fragment of a computer program however , if your article does n't match that style , someone will change it so it does , so do n't worry too much do n't forget to add links from other articles to yours , where it 's appropriate ; wikipedia has no '' soft link '' functionality moving articles from wikipedia to e2 is very easy the user who wishes to move wikipedia content to e2 has three other alternatives : 1 if you are an e2 user who is a member of such a usergroup , you may be able to convince the group to allow you to copy wikipedia material to that account whatever you do , you must attribute the material to wikipedia , and link to the gnu free documentation license as well

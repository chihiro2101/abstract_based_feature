unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia does n't have song lyrics , poetry , or fiction either ; it 's not a primary-source repository your contributions will be edited , rearranged , re-worded and expanded , and you should n't be shy about doing the same to other people 's work be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated and relatively anarchic , rather than having moderation imposed upon it see wikipedia : power structure for details the relative advantages of e2 and wikipedia are summarized in an exchange on e2 's editor logs in december 2003 , ( former ) e2 editor gn0sis cited reasons for '' why i 'm moving to wikipedia '' moving content from e2 to wikipedia for other noders ' writeups , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) any contributions you make to wikipedia are released under the gnu free documentation license for instance , wikipedia allows links to external web pages you do n't need to use markup to generate tables ; you can use standard html markup instead , as well as wikipedia 's concise table markup though you can use html entity escapes for '' , '' , ' ' , you do n't need to ; wikipedia has the wi ki > tag to suppress interpretation of control characters as markup what may be a perfectly acceptable write-up on e2 may well be a stub on wikipedia that can only be fixed by merging it into a larger article moving content from wikipedia to e2 whatever you do , you must attribute the material to wikipedia , and link to the gnu free documentation license as well

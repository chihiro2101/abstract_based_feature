unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia does n't have song lyrics , poetry , or fiction either ; it 's not a primary-source repository we do n't have a voting system or experience measure & mdash ; be assured that wikipedia : wikipediholic without it moving content from e2 to wikipedia you can move any of your own e2 writeups to wikipedia for other noders ' writeups , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) any contributions you make to wikipedia are released under the gnu free documentation license however , you retain the copyright to your own work and are free to modify and redistribute it in any way you wish generally it 's easiest to copy and paste the text and add markup rather than copying the e2 markup wikipedia also has some technical features that e2 lacks for instance , wikipedia allows links to external web pages do n't forget to add links from other articles to yours , where it 's appropriate ; wikipedia has no '' soft link '' functionality what may be a perfectly acceptable write-up on e2 may well be a stub on wikipedia that can only be fixed by merging it into a larger article it may take you a little time to get used to the wikipedia approach , but do n't worry too much about it moving content from wikipedia to e2 whatever you do , you must attribute the material to wikipedia , and link to the gnu free documentation license as well

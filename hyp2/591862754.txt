wikipedia is entirely focused on making an encyclopedia unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole wikipedia does n't have song lyrics , poetry , or fiction either ; it 's not a primary-source repository be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated and relatively anarchic , rather than having moderation imposed upon it we do n't have a voting system or experience measure & mdash ; be assured that wikipedia : wikipediholic without it the relative advantages of e2 and wikipedia are summarized in an exchange on e2 's editor logs in december 2003 , ( former ) e2 editor gn0sis cited reasons for '' why i 'm moving to wikipedia '' moving content from e2 to wikipedia for other noders ' writeups , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) however , you retain the copyright to your own work and are free to modify and redistribute it in any way you wish wikipedia also has some technical features that e2 lacks what may be a perfectly acceptable write-up on e2 may well be a stub on wikipedia that can only be fixed by merging it into a larger article see wikipedia : page size for some rough guidelines moving articles from wikipedia to e2 is very easy damian yerrick ( yerricde on e2 ) has provided an example of how to do this in his writeup in bullshit , which was derived from wikipedia 's article on bullshit if you are an e2 user who is a member of such a usergroup , you may be able to convince the group to allow you to copy wikipedia material to that account

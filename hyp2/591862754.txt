unlike e2 , there 's not a lot of unrelated socializing ; almost all of wikipedia 's chat is about improving specific articles or the project as a whole your contributions will be edited , rearranged , re-worded and expanded , and you should n't be shy about doing the same to other people 's work be bold in updating pages ! wikipedia is self-moderated and relatively anarchic , rather than having moderation imposed upon it we do n't have a voting system or experience measure & mdash ; be assured that wikipedia : wikipediholic without it in december 2003 , ( former ) e2 editor gn0sis cited reasons for '' why i 'm moving to wikipedia '' moving content from e2 to wikipedia you can even do this if your node has been improved by an e2 content editor for other noders ' writeups , you will need the permission of all major contributors ( see wikipedia : copyright ) you do n't need to use markup to generate tables ; you can use standard html markup instead , as well as wikipedia 's concise table markup it 's easy to link something by putting it in square brackets , and target work here too , but remember that two pairs of brackets surround a link in wikipedia wikipedia articles usually try to cover a subject in depth instead of concentrating on a single aspect thereof on wikipedia we try to quote opinions from people who are influential , or have some special expertise , and the best people for that generally wo n't be wikipedians moving content from wikipedia to e2 all you have to do is reformat the content appropriately ( e2 's text formatter makes it easy ) and follow the gnu free documentation license the user who wishes to move wikipedia content to e2 has three other alternatives : 1 whatever you do , you must attribute the material to wikipedia , and link to the gnu free documentation license as well

alexander the great strongly promoted shaving during his reign in the 4th century bc because he believed it looked tidier in some native american tribes , at the time of contact with british colonists , it was customary for men and women to remove all body hair according to an estimate by new york city barber charles de zemler , barbers ' shaving revenue dropped from about 50 percent around the time of the spanish–american war to 10 percent in 1939 due to the invention of the safety razor and electric razor 17–18 safety razors have been known to exist since at least 1876 when the single-edge star safety razor was patented by brothers frederick and otto kampfe the razor was essentially a small piece of a straight razor attached to a handle using a clamp mechanism before each shave the blade had to be attached to a special holder , stropped with a leather belt , and placed back into the razor 5–6 in 1895 , king camp gillette invented the double-edged safety razor , which utilised inexpensive , disposable blades sharpened from two sides military started issuing gillette shaving kits to its servicemen : in 1918 , the gillette sold 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades 18–21 the world war ii led to a similar increase in users when gillette was ordered to dedicate its entire razor production and most blade production to the u.s 68 gillette followed in 1971 with its trac ii cartridge razor that utilised two blades 67–69 gillette built on this twin blade design for a time , introducing new razors with added features such as a pivoting head , mckibben , p shaving can be done with a straight razor or safety razor ( called 'manual shaving ' or 'wet shaving ' ) or an electric razor ( called 'dry shaving ' ) or beard trimmer the removal of a full beard often requires the use of scissors or an hair trimmer to reduce the mass of hair , simplifying the process before wet shaving , the area to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by showering or bathing or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair a lathering or lubricating agent such as cream , shaving soap , gel , foam or oil is normally applied after this lubricating and moisturizing the skin to be shaved helps prevent irritation and damage known as razor burn men may use an aftershave lotion or balm after they have finished shaving hitachi has produced foil-type shavers with a rotary blade that operates similarly to the blade assembly of a reel-type lawn mower some people also find they do not experience ingrown hairs ( pseudofolliculitis barbae , also called razor bumps ) , when using an electric shaver the condition can be caused by shaving too closely , shaving with a blunt blade , dry shaving , applying too much pressure when shaving , shaving too quickly or roughly , or shaving against the grain shaving does not cause terminal hair to grow back thicker , coarser or darker this belief arose because hair that has never been cut has a naturally tapered end , as it emerges from the skin 's hair follicle , whereas , after cutting , there is no taper hindu , jain and buddhist ( usually only monks or nuns ) temples of shaving or plucking the hair from the scalp of priests and nuns as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem tools like scissors and electric razors , which cut the hair between two blades instead of between blade and skin , are permitted .

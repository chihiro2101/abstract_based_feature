in the united states , getting a straight razor shave in a barbershop and self-shaving with a straight razor were still common in the early 1900s 17–18 safety razors have been known to exist since at least 1876 when the single-edge star safety razor was patented by brothers frederick and otto kampfe 5–6 in 1895 , king camp gillette invented the double-edged safety razor , which utilised inexpensive , disposable blades sharpened from two sides 5–14 the razor gained popularity during world war i when the u.s military started issuing gillette shaving kits to its servicemen : in 1918 , the gillette sold 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades 40 in 1970 , wilkinson sword introduced the 'bonded blade ' razor , which consisted of a single blade housed in a plastic cartridge 68 gillette followed in 1971 with its trac ii cartridge razor that utilised two blades since then , razors with six and seven blades have been introduced other manufacturers , gillette included , soon introduced their own disposable razors , and by 1980 disposables made up more than 27 percent of worldwide unit sales for razors shaving can be done with a straight razor or safety razor ( called 'manual shaving ' or 'wet shaving ' ) or an electric razor ( called 'dry shaving ' ) or beard trimmer there are two types of manual razors : straight razor and safety razors safety razors are further subdivided into double-edged razors , single edge , injector razors , cartridge razors and disposable razors before wet shaving , the area to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by showering or bathing or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair a lathering or lubricating agent such as cream , shaving soap , gel , foam or oil is normally applied after this lubricating and moisturizing the skin to be shaved helps prevent irritation and damage known as razor burn when soap is used , it is generally applied with a shaving brush , which has long , soft bristles left since cuts are more likely when using safety razors and straight razors , wet shaving is generally done in more than one pass with the blade some people also find they do not experience ingrown hairs ( pseudofolliculitis barbae , also called razor bumps ) , when using an electric shaver shaving can have numerous side effects , including cuts , abrasions , and irritation shaving cuts can be caused by blade movement perpendicular to the blade 's cutting axis or by regular / orthogonal shaving over prominent bumps on the skin ( which the blade incises ) in some cases multi-bladed razors can cause skin irritation by shaving too close to the skin this belief arose because hair that has never been cut has a naturally tapered end , as it emerges from the skin 's hair follicle , whereas , after cutting , there is no taper hair can also appear darker after it grows back because hair that has never been cut is often lighter from sun exposure tools like scissors and electric razors , which cut the hair between two blades instead of between blade and skin , are permitted .

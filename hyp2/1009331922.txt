in some native american tribes , at the time of contact with british colonists , it was customary for men and women to remove all body hair in the united states , getting a straight razor shave in a barbershop and self-shaving with a straight razor were still common in the early 1900s according to an estimate by new york city barber charles de zemler , barbers ' shaving revenue dropped from about 50 percent around the time of the spanishâ€“american war to 10 percent in 1939 due to the invention of the safety razor and electric razor the razor was essentially a small piece of a straight razor attached to a handle using a clamp mechanism before each shave the blade had to be attached to a special holder , stropped with a leather belt , and placed back into the razor 40 in 1970 , wilkinson sword introduced the 'bonded blade ' razor , which consisted of a single blade housed in a plastic cartridge 68 gillette followed in 1971 with its trac ii cartridge razor that utilised two blades other manufacturers , gillette included , soon introduced their own disposable razors , and by 1980 disposables made up more than 27 percent of worldwide unit sales for razors shaving can be done with a straight razor or safety razor ( called 'manual shaving ' or 'wet shaving ' ) or an electric razor ( called 'dry shaving ' ) or beard trimmer the removal of a full beard often requires the use of scissors or an hair trimmer to reduce the mass of hair , simplifying the process there are two types of manual razors : straight razor and safety razors safety razors are further subdivided into double-edged razors , single edge , injector razors , cartridge razors and disposable razors double-edge razors are named so because the blade that they use has two sharp edges on opposite sides of the blade left since cuts are more likely when using safety razors and straight razors , wet shaving is generally done in more than one pass with the blade men may use an aftershave lotion or balm after they have finished shaving when the razor is held against the skin , the whiskers poke through the holes in the screen and are sliced by the moving blades the main disadvantages of electric shaving are that it may not cut the whiskers as closely as razor shaving does and it requires a source of electricity the advantages include fewer cuts to the skin , quicker shaving and no need for a water/lather supply in contrast to wet shaving , electric shave lotions are intended to stiffen the whiskers razor burn is a common problem , especially among those who shave coarse hairs on areas with sensitive skin like the bikini line , pubic hair , armpit , chest , and beard in some cases multi-bladed razors can cause skin irritation by shaving too close to the skin hair can also appear darker after it grows back because hair that has never been cut is often lighter from sun exposure observant jewish men are subject to restrictions on the shaving of their beards , as leviticus 19:27 forbids the shaving of the corners of the head and prohibits the marring of the corners of the beard tools like scissors and electric razors , which cut the hair between two blades instead of between blade and skin , are permitted .

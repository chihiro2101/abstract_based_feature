they were also often equipped with modems so they could be used remotely from character-mode terminals via dial-up telephone lines uucp used the computers ' modems to dial out to other computers , establishing temporary , point-to-point links between them each system in a uucp network has a list of neighbor systems , with phone numbers , login names and passwords , etc when work ( file transfer or command execution requests ) is queued for a neighbor system , the program typically calls that system to process the work over time , dial-up links were replaced by internet connections , and uucp added a number of new link layer protocols these newer connections also reduced the need for uucp at all , as newer application protocols developed to take advantage of the new networks today , uucp is rarely used over dial-up links , but is occasionally used over tcp/ip uucp 's longevity can be attributed to its low cost , extensive logging , native failover to dialup , and persistent queue management uucp is normally started by having a user log into the target system and then running the uucp program when uucico runs , it will expect to receive commands from another uucp program on the caller 's machine and begin a session the caller 's uucp responds with \20shostname options\0 , where options is a string containing zero or more unix-like option switches for instance , when the caller responds with their system name , the called system may optionally hang up if it does not recognize the caller , sending the ryou are unknown to me\0 response string and then disconnecting : r is a request for the called system to send a file to the caller ( download ) it is otherwise similar to s , using ry and rn to indicate the command was accepted and it will begin to send data or had a problem , and expecting a cy and cn5 from the caller at the end of the transfer this can be used to make that system call another and deliver files to it after sending an h command , the calling system sends a final packet ( control-p , six ohs , null-terminator ) and the called system responds with ( control-p , seven ohs , null-terminator ) some systems will simply hang up on the successful reception of the h command and not bother with the final handshake the protocol originated as a general-purpose system for packet delivery , and thus offers a number of features that are not used by the uucp package as a whole these include a secondary channel that can send command data interspersed with a file transfer , and the ability to renegotiate the packet and window sizes during transmission the packet format consisted of a 6-byte header and then between zero and 4096 bytes in the payload tt is the packet type , 0 for control packets ( which also requires k 9 to be valid ) , 1 for alternate data ( not used in uucp ) , 2 for data , and 3 indicates a short packet that re-defines the meaning of k in a control packet , xxx indicates the command and yyy is used for various parameters taylor uucp did not support g , but did support any valid requested window or packet size , so remote systems starting g would work fine with taylor 's g , while two taylor systems could negotiate even faster connections combined with the modem 's naturally higher data rates , they greatly improved overall throughput and generally performed about seven times the speed of a 2400 bps modem uucp implementations also include other transfer protocols for use over certain links taylor uucp also incorporated features of all previous versions of uucp , allowing it to communicate with any other version and even use similar config file formats from other versions uucp was sometimes used to designate a hostname as being reachable by uucp networking , although this was never formally registered in the domain name system ( dns ) as a top-level domain uucp address is recognized on an incoming smtp connection a user at a system with uucp connections could thereby exchange mail with internet users , and the internet links could be used to bypass large portions of the slow uucp network the uux command is used to execute a command on a remote system , or to execute a command on the local system using files from remote systems one surviving feature of uucp is the chat file format , largely inherited by the expect software package taylor uucp documentation â€“ useful information about uucp in general and various uucp protocols

users actively go to the website to check for responses internet users ' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers the downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting , which , with people all around the world in different time frames , could take a while the idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games , where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text there is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room , so that people can see who is in their virtual community a virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm users can choose to make avatars like themselves , or take on an entirely different personality than them when characters interact with other characters , they can get to know one another through text-based talking and virtual experience ( such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world ) a virtual community chat room may give real-time conversations , but people can only talk to one another in a virtual world , characters can do activities together , just like friends could do in reality communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real-life communities because the characters are physically in the same place , even if the users who are operating the characters are not second life is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the internet another use for virtual worlds has been in business communications howard rheingold 's virtual community could be compared with mark granovetter 's ground-breaking '' strength of weak ties '' article published twenty years earlier in the american journal of sociology indeed , in his revised version of virtual community , rheingold goes so far to say that had he read barry wellman 's work earlier , he would have called his book '' online social networks '' rheingold 's definition contains the terms '' social aggregation and personal relationships '' ( pp3 ) some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online identity theft or online predators

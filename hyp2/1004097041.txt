interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal the software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users ’ experience and designed specifically for online use user experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system the vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience the human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community as virtual communities grow , so do the diversity of their users usability tests can ensure users are communicating effectively using social and semiotic codes while maintaining their social identities as technologies evolve and mature , they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users this kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology does n't necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use people with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community , thus online communities act as primary means for such support involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment in addition to communities which focus strictly on information relating to illness and disease , there are also those which focus on specific health-related conditions such as fertility issues online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media , but also connect with large networked communities benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time , based on social practices and expectations there is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded , unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships in her 1995 book life on the screen : identity in the age of the internet , she argues that discrimination is easier in reality as it is easier to identify as face value , what is contrary to your norm the explosive diffusion of the internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities virtual communities may synthesize web 2.0 technologies with the community , and therefore have been described as community 2.0 , although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like plato and later on usenet online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online unlike in spoken conversations , message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses ; users actively go to the website to check for responses anyone can register to participate in an online message board they can simply click exit or log off , whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life the downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting , which , with people all around the world in different time frames , could take a while real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games , where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text now , chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics , so that people can talk with others who share similar interests the server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window the message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted virtual worlds are the most interactive of all virtual community forms the avatars that users create are like humans a virtual community chat room may give real-time conversations , but people can only talk to one another in a virtual world , characters can do activities together , just like friends could do in reality indeed , in his revised version of virtual community , rheingold goes so far to say that had he read barry wellman 's work earlier , he would have called his book '' online social networks '' recently , mitch parsell ( 2008 ) has suggested that virtual communities , particularly those that leverage web 2.0 resources , can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization , increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases internet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community the well : a story of love , death and real life in the seminal online community carroll & graf publishers hagel , j the virtual community : homesteading on the electronic frontier ( 1998 ) network and netplay virtual groups on the internet , mit press urstadt , bryant , '' social networking is not a business : web 2.0—the dream of the user-built , user-centered , user-run internet—has delivered on just about every promise except profit

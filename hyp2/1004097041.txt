virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically , and therefore are not communities under the original definition some online communities are linked geographically , and are known as community websites however , if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members , then a virtual community is certainly a community virtual communities resemble real life communities in the sense that they both provide support , information , friendship and acceptance between strangers early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality , whether communities actually could exist through the media , which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology in the seventeenth century , scholars associated with the royal society of london formed a community through the exchange of letters '' community without propinquity '' , coined by urban

and regional consciousness among early nation-states some authors that built their theories on anderson 's imagined communities have been critical of the concept , claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating , making use of the word '' virtual '' problematic or even obsolete virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups ; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal the software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users ’ experience and designed specifically for online use user experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning , productivity , user satisfaction , how much people remember using the software , and how many errors they make the human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community the success of online communities depend on the integration of usability and social semiotics usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user 's habits when interacting with a program.the information provided during a usability test can determine demographic factors and help define the semiotic social code usability tests can ensure users are communicating effectively using social and semiotic codes while maintaining their social identities this kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology does n't necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities rather , recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues these forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences , whether themselves or in their family people with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community , thus online communities act as primary means for such support online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease , as well as offer more practical support , such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease patients increasingly use such outlets , but the extent to which these practices have effects on health are still being studied individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment new forms of civic engagement and citizenship have emerged from the rise of social networking sites networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media , but also connect with large networked communities civic engagement through online volunteering has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning in his book the wealth of networks from 2006 , yochai benkler suggests that virtual communities would '' come to represent a new form of human communal existence , providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction '' although benkler 's prediction has not become entirely true , clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community lisa nakamura argues in chapter 16 of her 2002 book after/image of identity : gender , technology , and identity politics , that technology gives us iterations of our age , race and gender in virtual spaces , as opposed to them being fully extinguished doctor sherry turkle , professor of social studies of science and technology at mit , believes the internet is a place where actions of discrimination are less likely to occur the internet allows for a more fluid expression of identity and thus , we become more accepting of inconsistent personae within ourselves and others the explosive diffusion of the internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities virtual communities may synthesize web 2.0 technologies with the community , and therefore have been described as community 2.0 , although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like plato and later on usenet online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online this interaction emphasizes the reciprocity element of the unwritten social contract between community members internet users ' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers they can simply click exit or log off , whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life the lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people , because , if one chooses to keep it private , there is no associated label of gender , age , ethnicity or lifestyle the development of online chat rooms allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were in this type of virtual community , people are connected by living as an avatar in a computer-based world a virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real-life communities because the characters are physically in the same place , even if the users who are operating the characters are not some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online identity theft or online predators

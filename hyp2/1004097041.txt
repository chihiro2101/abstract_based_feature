the traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity ( neighborhoods , villages , etc virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically , and therefore are not communities under the original definition some online communities are linked geographically , and are known as community websites however , if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members , then a virtual community is certainly a community virtual communities resemble real life communities in the sense that they both provide support , information , friendship and acceptance between strangers early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality , whether communities actually could exist through the media , which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology '' community without propinquity '' , coined by urban planner melvin webber in 1963 and '' community liberated '' , analyzed by barry wellman in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community some authors that built their theories on anderson 's imagined communities have been critical of the concept , claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating , making use of the word '' virtual '' problematic or even obsolete virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups ; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal user experience is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community , because user experience will determine the software 's success the software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users â€™ experience and designed specifically for online use user experience metrics are based on user retention , using a consistent set of measurements to collect data on user experience the widespread use of the internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user 's habits when interacting with a program social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns people communicate their social identities or culture code through the work they do , the way they talk , the clothes they wear , their eating habits , domestic environments and possessions , and use of leisure time dialogue and social interactions , support information design , navigation support , and accessibility are integral components specific to online communities as virtual communities grow , so do the diversity of their users as technologies evolve and mature , they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities concerns with a virtual community 's tendency to promote less socializing include : verbal aggression and inhibitions , promotion of suicide and issues with privacy rather , recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues these forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences , whether themselves or in

need of medical information online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media , but also connect with large networked communities in his book the wealth of networks from 2006 , yochai benkler suggests that virtual communities would '' come to represent a new form of human communal existence , providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction '' although benkler 's prediction has not become entirely true , clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community the two main effects that can be seen according to benkler are a '' thickening of preexisting relations with friends , family and neighbours '' and the beginnings of the '' emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose , loose relationships '' there is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded , unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships nakamura uses a metaphor of '' after-images '' to describe the cultural phenomenon of expressing identity on the internet in her 1995 book life on the screen : identity in the age of the internet , she argues that discrimination is easier in reality as it is easier to identify as face value , what is contrary to your norm the internet allows for a more fluid expression of identity and thus , we become more accepting of inconsistent personae within ourselves and others the gaming community is extremely vast and accessible to a wide variety of people , however , there are negative effects on the relationships 'gamers ' have with the medium when expressing identity of gender the explosive diffusion of the internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities this interaction emphasizes the reciprocity element of the unwritten social contract between community members other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time people can choose to participate in the virtual community , even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas unlike chat rooms , at least in practice , message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users the original development by cb simulator hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time virtual worlds are the most interactive of all virtual community forms in this type of virtual community , people are connected by living as an avatar in a computer-based world characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality indeed , in his revised version of virtual community , rheingold goes so far to say that had he

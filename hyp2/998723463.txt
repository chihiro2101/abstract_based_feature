some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide boundaries between micro grains , if the oxide layer is crystalline , form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below for this reason , glass oxide coatings – which lack grain boundaries – can retard oxidation some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied lillie measured the effect of an active piece of iron touching a passive iron wire and found that '' a wave of activation sweeps rapidly ( at some hundred centimeters a second ) over its whole length '' the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface he found that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below for the surface passivation process , he developed the method of thermal oxidation , which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology before the invention of the integrated circuit , discrete diodes and transistors exhibited relatively high reverse bias junction leakages and low breakdown voltage , caused by the large density of traps at the surface of single crystal silicon atalla 's surface passivation process became the solution to this problem he discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a p–n junction intercepts the surface , the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100 according to fairchild semiconductor engineer chih-tang sah , the surface passivation process developed by atalla 's team '' blazed the trail '' that led to the development of the silicon integrated circuit chemical conversion coating on aluminum chromate conversion is a common way of passivating not only aluminium , but also zinc , cadmium , copper , silver , magnesium , and tin alloys however , proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel , which is difficult to passivate , as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath in the area of microelectronics and photovoltaics surface passivation is usually implemented by oxidation to a coating of silicon dioxide

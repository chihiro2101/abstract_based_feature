some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide boundaries between micro grains , if the oxide layer is crystalline , form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below by growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer , atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer for the surface passivation process , he developed the method of thermal oxidation , which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology before the invention of the integrated circuit , discrete diodes and transistors exhibited relatively high reverse bias junction leakages and low breakdown voltage , caused by the large density of traps at the surface of single crystal silicon oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics , while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off according to fairchild semiconductor engineer chih-tang sah , the surface passivation process developed by atalla 's team '' blazed the trail '' that led to the development of the silicon integrated circuit atalla 's surface passivation method was the basis for several important inventions in 1959 : the mosfet ( mos transistor ) by atalla and dawon kahng at bell labs , the planar process by jean hoerni at fairchild semiconductor , and the monolithic integrated circuit chip by robert noyce at fairchild in 1959 by the mid-1960s , atalla 's process for oxidized silicon surfaces was used to fabricate virtually all integrated circuits and silicon devices in carbon quantum dot ( cqd ) technology , cqds are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 & nbsp ; nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation however , the aluminium layer clad on is designed to spontaneously develop the oxide layer and thus protect the base alloy chromate conversion coating converts the surface aluminium to an aluminium chromate coating in the range of in thickness in the area of microelectronics and photovoltaics surface passivation is usually implemented by oxidation to a coating of silicon dioxide

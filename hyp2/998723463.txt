some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m in 1955 , carl frosch and lincoln derick at bell telephone laboratories ( btl ) accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) could be grown on silicon they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface spitzer , who studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides , managed to fabricate a high quality si/silicon dioxide stack , with atalla and kahng making use of their findings atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below for the surface passivation process , he developed the method of thermal oxidation , which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology atalla 's surface passivation process became the solution to this problem he discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a pâ€“n junction intercepts the surface , the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100 by the mid-1960s , atalla 's process for oxidized silicon surfaces was used to fabricate virtually all integrated circuits and silicon devices in carbon quantum dot ( cqd ) technology , cqds are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 & nbsp ; nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments alclading , which metallurgically bonds thin layers of pure aluminium or alloy to different base aluminium alloy , is not strictly passivation of the base alloy ferrous materials , including steel , may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation ( '' rust '' ) and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating however , proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel , which is difficult to passivate , as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath in the area of microelectronics and photovoltaics surface passivation is usually implemented by oxidation to a coating of silicon dioxide

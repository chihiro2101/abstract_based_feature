some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied if passive iron is touched by active iron , it becomes active again the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m in 1955 , carl frosch and lincoln derick at bell telephone laboratories ( btl ) accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) could be grown on silicon he found that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below by growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer , atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer for the surface passivation process , he developed the method of thermal oxidation , which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology atalla 's surface passivation process became the solution to this problem he discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a pâ€“n junction intercepts the surface , the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100 aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments some aluminium alloys , however , do not form the oxide layer well , and thus are not protected against corrosion ferrous materials , including steel , may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation ( '' rust '' ) and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating however , proprietary passivation processes exist for martensitic stainless steel , which is difficult to passivate , as microscopic discontinuities can form in the surface of a machined part during passivation in a typical nitric acid bath the '' method '' is either a nitric acid-based passivating bath , or a citric acid-based bath , these acids remove surface iron and rust , while sparing the chromium in the area of microelectronics and photovoltaics surface passivation is usually implemented by oxidation to a coating of silicon dioxide

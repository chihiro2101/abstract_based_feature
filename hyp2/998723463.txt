there has been much interest in determining the mechanisms that govern the increase of thickness of the oxide layer over time some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide boundaries between micro grains , if the oxide layer is crystalline , form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below for this reason , glass oxide coatings – which lack grain boundaries – can retard oxidation some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied in the mid 1800s , christian friedrich schönbein discovered that when a piece of iron is placed in dilute nitric acid , it will dissolve and produce hydrogen , but if the iron is placed in concentrated nitric acid and then returned to the dilute nitric acid , little or no reaction will take place the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m in 1955 , carl frosch and lincoln derick at bell telephone laboratories ( btl ) accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide ( sio 2 ) could be grown on silicon they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface spitzer , who studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides , managed to fabricate a high quality si/silicon dioxide stack , with atalla and kahng making use of their findings atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below by growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer , atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer for the surface passivation process , he developed the method of thermal oxidation , which was a breakthrough in silicon semiconductor technology oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics , while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments the '' method '' is either a nitric acid-based passivating bath , or a citric acid-based bath , these acids remove surface iron and rust , while sparing the chromium chromate conversion coating ( chemical film ) per mil-dtl-5541f for aluminium and aluminium alloy parts a standard overview on black oxide coatings is provided in mil-hdbk-205 , phosphate & black oxide coating of ferrous metals

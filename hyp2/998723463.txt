some of the important factors are the volume of oxide relative to the volume of the parent metal , the mechanism of oxygen diffusion through the metal oxide to the parent metal , and the relative chemical potential of the oxide boundaries between micro grains , if the oxide layer is crystalline , form an important pathway for oxygen to reach the unoxidized metal below some corrosion inhibitors help the formation of a passivation layer on the surface of the metals to which they are applied the surface passivation process , also known as the atalla passivation technique , was developed by mohamed m they showed that oxide layer prevented certain dopants into the silicon wafer , while allowing for others , thus discovering the passivating effect of oxidation on the semiconductor surface he found that silicon oxide layers could be used to electrically stabilize silicon surfaces atalla developed the surface passivation process , a new method of semiconductor device fabrication that involves coating a silicon wafer with an insulating layer of silicon oxide so that electricity could reliably penetrate to the conducting silicon below by growing a layer of silicon dioxide on top of a silicon wafer , atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer he discovered that when a thin layer of silicon dioxide was grown on the surface of silicon where a pâ€“n junction intercepts the surface , the leakage current of the junction was reduced by a factor from 10 to 100 oxide-passivation of silicon surfaces allowed diodes and transistors to be fabricated with significantly improved device characteristics , while the leakage path along the surface of the silicon was also effectively shut off according to fairchild semiconductor engineer chih-tang sah , the surface passivation process developed by atalla 's team '' blazed the trail '' that led to the development of the silicon integrated circuit by the mid-1960s , atalla 's process for oxidized silicon surfaces was used to fabricate virtually all integrated circuits and silicon devices in solar cell technology , surface passivation is critical to solar cell efficiency in carbon quantum dot ( cqd ) technology , cqds are small carbon nanoparticles ( less than 10 & nbsp ; nm in size ) with some form of surface passivation aluminium naturally forms a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide on contact with oxygen in the atmosphere through a process called oxidation , which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in many environments the passivation process removes exogenous iron , creates/restores a passive oxide layer that prevents further oxidation ( rust ) , and cleans the parts of dirt , scale , or other welding-generated compounds ( e.g in the area of microelectronics and photovoltaics surface passivation is usually implemented by oxidation to a coating of silicon dioxide

the youngest toba eruption occurred at the present location of lake toba in indonesia , about 75,000 ± 900 years bp according to potassium argon dating this eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of the lake toba caldera during the quaternary period , and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall , the youngest toba tuff volcanic winter and global cooling computer models rampino and volcanologist stephen self argue that the eruption caused a '' brief , dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter ' '' , which resulted in a drop of the global mean surface temperature by 3–5 & nbsp ; °c the eruption may have caused this 1,000-year period of cooler temperatures ( stadial ) , two centuries of which could be accounted for by the persistence of the toba stratospheric loading rampino and self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption , but that the process was slow ; the youngest toba tuff '' may have provided the extra 'kick ' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states '' the youngest toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago , which may have resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate see also however , evidence from pollen analysis has suggested prolonged deforestation in south asia , and some researchers have suggested that the toba eruption may have forced humans to adopt new adaptive strategies , which may have permitted them to replace neanderthals and '' other archaic human species '' some evidence points to genetic bottlenecks in other animals in the wake of the youngest toba eruption a 2018 study by chad yost and colleagues of cores from lake malawi dating to the period of the youngest toba eruption showed no evidence of a volcanic winter , and they argue that there was no effect on african humans

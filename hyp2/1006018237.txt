the youngest toba eruption occurred at the present location of lake toba in indonesia , about 75,000 ± 900 years bp according to potassium argon dating this eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of the lake toba caldera during the quaternary period , and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall , the youngest toba tuff the erupted mass was , at the very least , 12 times greater than that of the largest volcanic eruption in recent history , the 1815 eruption of mount tambora in indonesia , which caused the 1816 '' year without a summer '' in the northern hemisphere rampino and volcanologist stephen self argue that the eruption caused a '' brief , dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter ' '' , which resulted in a drop of the global mean surface temperature by 3–5 & nbsp ; °c the eruption may have caused this 1,000-year period of cooler temperatures ( stadial ) , two centuries of which could be accounted for by the persistence of the toba stratospheric loading rampino and self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption , but that the process was slow ; the youngest toba tuff '' may have provided the extra 'kick ' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states '' according to alan robock , who has also published nuclear winter papers , the toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period the youngest toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago , which may have resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate for example , ancient stone tools in southern india were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the youngest toba eruption and were very similar across these layers , suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population analyses of mitochondrial dna have estimated that the major migration from africa occurred 60,000–70,000 years ago , consistent with dating of the youngest toba eruption to around 75,000 years ago

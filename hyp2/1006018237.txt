the youngest toba eruption occurred at the present location of lake toba in indonesia , about 75,000 ± 900 years bp according to potassium argon dating this eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of the lake toba caldera during the quaternary period , and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall , the youngest toba tuff dense-rock equivalent ( dre ) estimates of eruptive volume for the eruption vary between 2,000 km³ and 3,000 km³ ; the most common dre estimate is 2,800 km³ ( about of erupted magma , of which 800 km³ was deposited as ash fall toba 's erupted mass deposited an ash layer of about thick over the whole of south asia rampino and self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption , but that the process was slow ; the youngest toba tuff '' may have provided the extra 'kick ' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states '' according to alan robock , who has also published nuclear winter papers , the toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period . despite these different estimates , scientists agree that a supervolcanic eruption of the scale at the lake toba caldera must have led to very extensive ash-fall layers and injection of noxious gases into the atmosphere , with worldwide effects on weather and climate the youngest toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago , which may have resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate some evidence points to genetic bottlenecks in other animals in the wake of the youngest toba eruption analyses of mitochondrial dna have estimated that the major migration from africa occurred 60,000–70,000 years ago , consistent with dating of the youngest toba eruption to around 75,000 years ago

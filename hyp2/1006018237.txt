the youngest toba eruption occurred at the present location of lake toba in indonesia , about 75,000 ± 900 years bp according to potassium argon dating this eruption was the last and largest of four eruptions of the lake toba caldera during the quaternary period , and is also recognized from its diagnostic horizon of ashfall , the youngest toba tuff it had an estimated volcanic explosivity index of 8 ( the highest rating of any known eruption on earth ) ; it made a sizable contribution to the 100 × & nbsp ; 35 km caldera complex rampino and volcanologist stephen self argue that the eruption caused a '' brief , dramatic cooling or 'volcanic winter ' '' , which resulted in a drop of the global mean surface temperature by 3–5 & nbsp ; °c rampino and self believe that global cooling was already underway at the time of the eruption , but that the process was slow ; the youngest toba tuff '' may have provided the extra 'kick ' that caused the climate system to switch from warm to cold states '' according to alan robock , who has also published nuclear winter papers , the toba eruption did not precipitate the last glacial period the youngest toba eruption has been linked to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution about 70,000 years ago , which may have resulted in a severe reduction in the size of the total human population due to the effects of the eruption on the global climate for example , ancient stone tools in southern india were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the youngest toba eruption and were very similar across these layers , suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population . additional caveats include difficulties in estimating the global and regional climatic impacts of the eruption and lack of conclusive evidence for the eruption preceding the bottleneck analyses of mitochondrial dna have estimated that the major migration from africa occurred 60,000–70,000 years ago , consistent with dating of the youngest toba eruption to around 75,000 years ago

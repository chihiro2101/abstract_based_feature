there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 '' in 1929 , andrew kucher of ford began experimenting with the levapad concept , metal disks with pressurized air blown through a hole in the center kaario began designing a developed version of a vessel using an air cushion and built a prototype ( 'surface soarer ' ) , in 1937 kaario never received funding to build his design , however however , the start of world war ii put an end to levkov 's development work during world war ii , an american engineer , charles fletcher , invented a walled air cushion vehicle , the glidemobile the idea of the modern hovercraft is most often associated with a british mechanical engineer christopher cockerell cockerell 's group was the first to develop the use of a ring of air for maintaining the cushion , the first to develop a successful skirt , and the first to demonstrate a practical vehicle in continued use in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s ' '' '' air apparent '' , maritime defence management journal , issue 47 a memorial to cockerell 's first design stands in the village of somerleyton cockerell was finally able to convince the national research development corporation to fund development of a full-scale model in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust testing quickly demonstrated that the idea of using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs a turbomeca marbor√© turbojet for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for directional control were added , producing the sr.n1 mk ii a further upgrade with the armstrong siddeley viper produced the mk iii further modifications , especially the addition of pointed nose and stern areas , produced the mk iv in october 1961 , latimer-needham sold his skirt patents to westland , who had recently taken over saunders roe 's interest in the hovercraft when deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design , air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well , keeping the channel open although there was some deformation of the curtain , the airflow within the skirt was maintained and the lift remained relatively steady through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations another major pioneering effort of the early hovercraft era was carried out by jean bertin 's firm in france during the early 1960s he developed a series of prototype designs , which he called '' terraplanes '' if they were aimed for land use , and '' naviplanes '' for water it set a speed record between boulogne and dover of another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over on flat surfaces , like pavement , the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels by the early 1970s , the basic concept had been well developed , and the hovercraft had found a number of niche roles where its combination of features were advantageous today , they are found primarily in military use for amphibious operations , search and rescue vehicles in shallow water , and sporting vehicles small craft , such as the sr.n6 , usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward the sr.n1 was powered by a single piston engine , driven by expelled air it was later found that the craft 's hover height was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air the skirt was an independent invention made by a royal navy officer , c.h latimer-needham , who sold his idea to westland ( by then the parent of saunders-roe 's helicopter and hovercraft interests ) , and who worked with cockerell to develop the idea further in 1966 , two cross-channel passenger hovercraft services were inaugurated using sr.n6 hovercraft one of these models , the hm-2 , was used by red funnel between southampton ( near the woolston floating bridge ) and cowes the world 's first car-carrying hovercraft was made in 1968 , the bhc sr.n4 ( sr.n4 ) models , each powered by four bristol proteus turboshaft engines hoverlloyd operated from ramsgate , where a special hoverport had been built at pegwell bay , to calais the later sr.n4 mk.iii had a capacity of 418 passengers and 60 cars the commercial success of hovercraft suffered from rapid rises in fuel prices during the late 1960s and 1970s , following conflict in the middle east although developed elsewhere in the world for both civil and military purposes , except for the solent ryde to southsea crossing , hovercraft disappeared from the coastline of britain until a range of griffon hovercraft were bought by the royal national lifeboat institution avon fire and rescue service became the first local authority fire service in the uk to operate a hovercraft a griffon rescue hovercraft has been in use for a number of years with the airport fire service at dundee airport in scotland in october 2008 , the red cross commenced a flood-rescue service hovercraft based in inverness , scotland hovercraft are still manufactured in the uk , near to where they were first conceived and tested , on the isle of wight the first application of the hovercraft for military use was by the british armed forces , using hovercraft built by saunders-roe the finnish navy designed an experimental missile attack hovercraft class , tuuli class hovercraft , in the late 1990s apart from the craft designed as '' racing hovercraft '' , which are often only suitable for racing , there is another form of small personal hovercraft for leisure use , often referred to as cruising hovercraft , capable of carrying up to four people a test track for a tracked hovercraft system was built at earith near cambridge , england

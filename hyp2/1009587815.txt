there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat the vessel also required a depth of water to operate and could not transition to land or other surfaces it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 kaario 's design included the modern features of a lift engine blowing air into a flexible envelope for lift the idea of the modern hovercraft is most often associated with a british mechanical engineer christopher cockerell cockerell came across the key concept in his design when studying the ring of airflow when high-pressure air was blown into the annular area between two concentric tin cans ( one coffee and the other from cat food ) and a hair dryer this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it this effect , which he called the '' momentum curtain '' , could be used to trap high-pressure air in the area inside the curtain , producing a high-pressure plenum that earlier examples had to build up with considerably more airflow in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter in spite of tireless efforts to arrange funding , no branch of the military was interested , as he later joked , '' the navy said it was a plane not a boat ; the air force said it was a boat not a plane ; and the army was 'plain not interested ' '' '' air apparent '' , maritime defence management journal , issue 47 a memorial to cockerell 's first design stands in the village of somerleyton in december 1959 , the duke of edinburgh visited saunders-roe at east cowes and persuaded the chief test-pilot , commander peter lamb , to allow him to take over the sr.n1 's controls testing quickly demonstrated that the idea of using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs a turbomeca marboré turbojet for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for directional control were added , producing the sr.n1 mk ii in october 1961 , latimer-needham sold his skirt patents to westland , who had recently taken over saunders roe 's interest in the hovercraft what actually happened is that the slight narrowing of the distance between the walls resulted in less airflow , which in turn led to more air loss under that section of the skirt the fuselage above this area would drop due to the loss of lift at that point , and this led to further pressure on the skirt after considerable experimentation , denys bliss at hovercraft development ltd instead of using two separate rubber sheets to form the skirt , a single sheet of rubber was bent into a u shape to provide both sides , with slots cut into the bottom of the u forming the annular vent through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above during the early 1960s he developed a series of prototype designs , which he called '' terraplanes '' if they were aimed for land use , and '' naviplanes '' for water another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over however , as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension , it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex these designs competed with maglev systems in the high-speed arena , where their primary advantage was the very '' low tech '' tracks they needed on the downside , the air blowing dirt and trash out from under the trains presented a unique problem in stations , and interest in them waned in the 1970s by the early 1970s , the basic concept had been well developed , and the hovercraft had found a number of niche roles where its combination of features were advantageous today , they are found primarily in military use for amphibious operations , search and rescue vehicles in shallow water , and sporting vehicles small craft , such as the sr.n6 , usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward latimer-needham , who sold his idea to westland ( by then the parent of saunders-roe 's helicopter and hovercraft interests ) , and who worked with cockerell to develop the idea further the first passenger-carrying hovercraft to enter service was the vickers va-3 , which , in the summer of 1962 , carried passengers regularly along the north wales coast from moreton , merseyside , to rhyl welded aluminium structure and diesel engines ) rather than the aircraft techniques used to build the earlier craft built by saunders-roe-british hovercraft corporation in 1966 , two cross-channel passenger hovercraft services were inaugurated using sr.n6 hovercraft hoverlloyd ran services from ramsgate harbour , england , to calais , france , and european ferries also started a service to calais from dover , which was soon superseded by that of seaspeed as well as saunders-roe and vickers ( which combined in 1966 to form the british hovercraft corporation ( bhc ) ) , other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the uk by cushioncraft ( part of the britten-norman group ) and hovermarine based at woolston ( the latter being surface effect ship , where the sides of the hull projected down into the water to trap the cushion of air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern ) the world 's first car-carrying hovercraft was made in 1968 , the bhc sr.n4 ( sr.n4 ) models , each powered by four bristol proteus turboshaft engines these were both used by rival operators hoverlloyd and seaspeed ( joined to form hoverspeed in 1981 ) to operate regular car and passenger carrying services across the english channel the later sr.n4 mk.iii had a capacity of 418 passengers and 60 cars these were later joined by the french-built sedam n500 naviplane with a capacity of 385 passengers and 45 cars ; only one entered service and was used intermittently for a few years on the cross-channel service until returned to sncf in 1983 the service ceased on 1 october 2000 after 32 & nbsp ; years , due to competition with traditional ferries , catamaran , the disappearance of duty-free shopping within the eu , the advancing age of the sr.n4 hovercraft and the opening of the channel tunnel designated 'suna-x ' , it is used as a high speed ferry for up to 47 passengers and of freight serving the remote alaskan villages of king cove and cold bay the soviet union was also one of the first nations to use a hovercraft , the bora , as a guided missile corvette , though this craft possessed rigid , non-inflatable sides the hovercraft club of great britain , founded in 1966 , regularly organizes inland and coastal hovercraft race events at various venues across the united kingdom a real benefit of air cushion vehicles in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain , such as swamps , was overlooked by the excitement of the british government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft several attempts have been made to adopt air cushion technology for use in fixed track systems , in order to use the lower frictional forces for delivering high speeds they were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions , nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface this hovercraft can transport three t-80 main battle tanks ( mbt ) , 140 fully equipped troops , or up to 130 & nbsp ; tons of cargo longest continuous use – the original prototype sr.n6 ( 009 ) was in service for over 20 & nbsp ; years , and logged a remarkable 22,000 & nbsp ; hours of use

there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat shaped like a section of a large aerofoil ( this creates a low pressure area above the wing much like an aircraft ) , the craft was propelled by four aero engines driving two submerged marine propellers , with a fifth engine that blew air under the front of the craft to increase the air pressure under it only when in motion could the craft trap air under the front , increasing lift the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 '' in 1929 , andrew kucher of ford began experimenting with the levapad concept , metal disks with pressurized air blown through a hole in the center by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails kaario began designing a developed version of a vessel using an air cushion and built a prototype ( 'surface soarer ' ) , in 1937 kaario 's design included the modern features of a lift engine blowing air into a flexible envelope for lift during world war ii , an american engineer , charles fletcher , invented a walled air cushion vehicle , the glidemobile this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it this effect , which he called the '' momentum curtain '' , could be used to trap high-pressure air in the area inside the curtain , producing a high-pressure plenum that earlier examples had to build up with considerably more airflow in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s the sr.n1 was powered by a 450 & nbsp ; hp alvis leonides engine powering a vertical fan in the middle of the craft in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust in normal operation this extra airflow was directed rearward for forward thrust , and blew over two large vertical rudders that provided directional control the sr.n1 made its first hover on 11 june 1959 , and made its famed successful crossing of the english channel on 25 july 1959 on examination of the craft afterwards , it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed , damage that was never allowed to be repaired , and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'royal dent' testing quickly demonstrated that the idea of using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs a turbomeca marboré turbojet for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for directional control were added , producing the sr.n1 mk ii although the sr.n1 was successful as a testbed , the design hovered too close to the surface to be practical ; at even small waves would hit the bow in 1958 , he suggested the use of two rings of rubber to produce a double-walled extension of the vents in the lower fuselage in october 1961 , latimer-needham sold his skirt patents to westland , who had recently taken over saunders roe 's interest in the hovercraft as part of consolidation of british helicopter activities by several aero companies into one experiments with the skirt design demonstrated a problem ; it was originally expected that pressure applied to the outside of the skirt would bend it inward , and the now-displaced airflow would cause it to pop back out when deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design , air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well , keeping the channel open although there was some deformation of the curtain , the airflow within the skirt was maintained and the lift remained relatively steady over time , this design evolved into individual extensions over the bottom of the slots in the skirt , known as '' fingers '' bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above on flat surfaces , like pavement , the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels by the early 1970s , the basic concept had been well developed , and the hovercraft had found a number of niche roles where its combination of features were advantageous small craft , such as the sr.n6 , usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward two 98 seat ap1-88 hovercraft were introduced on this route in 1983 , and in 2007 , these were joined by the first 130-seat bht130 craft welded aluminium structure and diesel engines ) rather than the aircraft techniques used to build the earlier craft built by saunders-roe-british hovercraft corporation in 1966 , two cross-channel passenger hovercraft services were inaugurated using sr.n6 hovercraft alternative over-water vehicles , such as wave-piercing catamarans ( marketed as the seacat in the uk until 2005 ) , use less fuel and can perform most of the hovercraft 's marine tasks although developed elsewhere in the world for both civil and military purposes , except for the solent ryde to southsea crossing , hovercraft disappeared from the coastline of britain until a range of griffon hovercraft were bought by the royal national lifeboat institution hovercraft used to ply between the gateway of india in mumbai and cbd belapur and vashi in navi mumbai between 1994 and 1999 , but the services were subsequently stopped due to the lack of sufficient water transport infrastructure in england , hovercraft of the burnham-on-sea area rescue boat ( barb ) are used to rescue people from thick mud in bridgwater bay the canadian coast guard uses hovercraft to break light ice since 2006 , hovercraft have been used in aid in madagascar by hoveraid , an international ngo who use the hovercraft to reach the most remote places on the island the scandinavian airline sas used to charter an ap1-88 hovercraft for regular passengers between copenhagen airport , denmark , and the sas hovercraft terminal in malmö , sweden bethel is far removed from the alaska road system , thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service hovercraft service is suspended for several weeks each year while the river is beginning to freeze to minimize damage to the river ice surface designated 'suna-x ' , it is used as a high speed ferry for up to 47 passengers and of freight serving the remote alaskan villages of king cove and cold bay marketed as forthfast , the service used a craft chartered from hovertravel and achieved an 85 % passenger load factor in 1961 , the united kingdom set up the interservice hovercraft trials unit ( ihtu ) based at rnas lee-on-solent ( hms daedalus ) , now the site of the hovercraft museum , near portsmouth in august 2010 , the hovercraft club of great britain hosted the world hovercraft championships at towcester racecourse the world hovercraft championships are run under the auspices of the world hovercraft federation they were not especially good as vacuum cleaners as the air escaping from under the cushion blew uncollected dust in all directions , nor as hovercraft as their lack of a skirt meant that they only hovered effectively over a smooth surface the hovercraft museum at lee-on-the-solent , hampshire , england , houses the world 's largest collection of hovercraft designs , including some of the earliest and largest

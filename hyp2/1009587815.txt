there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat only when in motion could the craft trap air under the front , increasing lift it was thoroughly tested and even armed with torpedoes and machine guns for operation in the adriatic it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 he initially imagined these being used in place of casters and wheels in factories and warehouses , where the concrete floors offered the smoothness required for operation by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails however , the start of world war ii put an end to levkov 's development work the idea of the modern hovercraft is most often associated with a british mechanical engineer christopher cockerell cockerell came across the key concept in his design when studying the ring of airflow when high-pressure air was blown into the annular area between two concentric tin cans ( one coffee and the other from cat food ) and a hair dryer this effect , which he called the '' momentum curtain '' , could be used to trap high-pressure air in the area inside the curtain , producing a high-pressure plenum that earlier examples had to build up with considerably more airflow cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s in 1958 , the nrdc placed a contract with saunders-roe for the development of what would become the sr.n1 , short for '' saunders-roe , nautical 1 '' the sr.n1 was powered by a 450 & nbsp ; hp alvis leonides engine powering a vertical fan in the middle of the craft the sr.n1 made its first hover on 11 june 1959 , and made its famed successful crossing of the english channel on 25 july 1959 testing quickly demonstrated that the idea of using a single engine to provide air for both the lift curtain and forward flight required too many trade-offs a further upgrade with the armstrong siddeley viper produced the mk iii although the sr.n1 was successful as a testbed , the design hovered too close to the surface to be practical ; at even small waves would hit the bow when air was blown into the space between the sheets it exited the bottom of the skirt in the same way it formerly exited the bottom of the fuselage , re-creating the same momentum curtain , but this time at some distance from the bottom of the craft as part of consolidation of british helicopter activities by several aero companies into one experiments with the skirt design demonstrated a problem ; it was originally expected that pressure applied to the outside of the skirt would bend it inward , and the now-displaced airflow would cause it to pop back out the fuselage above this area would drop due to the loss of lift at that point , and this led to further pressure on the skirt when deforming pressure was applied to the outside of this design , air pressure in the rest of the skirt forced the inner wall to move in as well , keeping the channel open through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations the best known of these designs was the n500 naviplane , built for seaspeed by the société d'etude et de développement des aéroglisseurs marins ( sedam ) another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over however , as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension , it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex today , they are found primarily in military use for amphibious operations , search and rescue vehicles in shallow water , and sporting vehicles small craft , such as the sr.n6 , usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox the air inflates the '' skirt '' under the vehicle , causing it to rise above the surface christopher cockerell was on board , and the flight took place on the 50th anniversary of louis blériot 's first aerial crossing the sr.n1 did not have any skirt , using instead the peripheral air principle that cockerell had patented the first passenger-carrying hovercraft to enter service was the vickers va-3 , which , in the summer of 1962 , carried passengers regularly along the north wales coast from moreton , merseyside , to rhyl two 98 seat ap1-88 hovercraft were introduced on this route in 1983 , and in 2007 , these were joined by the first 130-seat bht130 craft the ap1-88 and the bht130 were notable as they were largely built by hoverwork using shipbuilding techniques and materials ( i.e over 20 & nbsp ; million passengers had used the service as of 2004 – the service is still operating and is by far the longest , continuously operated hovercraft service the commercial success of hovercraft suffered from rapid rises in fuel prices during the late 1960s and 1970s , following conflict in the middle east hovercraft used to ply between the gateway of india in mumbai and cbd belapur and vashi in navi mumbai between 1994 and 1999 , but the services were subsequently stopped due to the lack of sufficient water transport infrastructure in finland , small hovercraft are widely used in maritime rescue and during the rasputitsa ( '' mud season '' ) as archipelago liaison vehicles in england , hovercraft of the burnham-on-sea area rescue boat ( barb ) are used to rescue people from thick mud in bridgwater bay avon fire and rescue service became the first local authority fire service in the uk to operate a hovercraft it is used in the event of an aircraft ditching in the tay estuary in october 2008 , the red cross commenced a flood-rescue service hovercraft based in inverness , scotland gloucestershire fire and rescue service received two flood-rescue hovercraft donated by severn trent following the 2007 uk floods the scandinavian airline sas used to charter an ap1-88 hovercraft for regular passengers between copenhagen airport , denmark , and the sas hovercraft terminal in malmö , sweden bethel is far removed from the alaska road system , thus making the hovercraft an attractive alternative to the air based delivery methods used prior to introduction of the hovercraft service designated 'suna-x ' , it is used as a high speed ferry for up to 47 passengers and of freight serving the remote alaskan villages of king cove and cold bay the finnish navy designed an experimental missile attack hovercraft class , tuuli class hovercraft , in the late 1990s umta built an extensive test site in pueblo , colorado , with different types of tracks for the different technologies used by the prototype contractors world 's largest civil hovercraft – the bhc sr.n4 mk.iii , at 56.4 & nbsp ; m ( 185 & nbsp ; ft ) length and 310 metric tons ( 305 long tons ) weight , can accommodate 418 passengers and 60 cars this hovercraft can transport three t-80 main battle tanks ( mbt ) , 140 fully equipped troops , or up to 130 & nbsp ;

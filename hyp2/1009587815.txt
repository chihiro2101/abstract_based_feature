there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat the vessel also required a depth of water to operate and could not transition to land or other surfaces it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force several must be used together to support a load above them by the 1950s , ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system , but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains , with the levapads running close to the surface of existing rails kaario began designing a developed version of a vessel using an air cushion and built a prototype ( 'surface soarer ' ) , in 1937 kaario 's design included the modern features of a lift engine blowing air into a flexible envelope for lift kaario 's efforts were followed closely in the soviet union by vladimir levkov , who returned to the solid-sided design of the the idea of the modern hovercraft is most often associated with a british mechanical engineer christopher cockerell cockerell 's group was the first to develop the use of a ring of air for maintaining the cushion , the first to develop a successful skirt , and the first to demonstrate a practical vehicle in continued use in theory , only a small amount of active airflow would be needed to create lift and much less than a design that relied only on the momentum of the air to provide lift , like a helicopter in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s the design featured an engine mounted to blow from the front of the craft into a space below it , combining both lift and propulsion in 1958 , the nrdc placed a contract with saunders-roe for the development of what would become the sr.n1 , short for '' saunders-roe , nautical 1 '' in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust for low-speed maneuverability , the extra thrust could be directed fore or aft , differentially for rotation the sr.n1 made its first hover on 11 june 1959 , and made its famed successful crossing of the english channel on 25 july 1959 on examination of the craft afterwards , it was found that she had been dished in the bow due to excessive speed , damage that was never allowed to be repaired , and was from then on affectionately referred to as the 'royal dent' a further upgrade with the armstrong siddeley viper produced the mk iii in 1958 , he suggested the use of two rings of rubber to produce a double-walled extension of the vents in the lower fuselage over time , this design evolved into individual extensions over the bottom of the slots in the skirt , known as '' fingers '' small-scale ferry service started as early as 1962 with the launch of the vickers-armstrong va-3 another major pioneering effort of the early hovercraft era was carried out by jean bertin 's firm in france bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above the best known of these designs was the n500 naviplane , built for seaspeed by the société d'etude et de développement des aéroglisseurs marins ( sedam ) on the downside , the air blowing dirt and trash out from under the trains presented a unique problem in stations , and interest in them waned in the 1970s by the early 1970s , the basic concept had been well developed , and the hovercraft had found a number of niche roles where its combination of features were advantageous on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft the air inflates the '' skirt '' under the vehicle , causing it to rise above the surface some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt , the rest of the air passing out of the back to push the craft forward the sr.n1 was powered by a single piston engine , driven by expelled air the sr.n1 did not have any skirt , using instead the peripheral air principle that cockerell had patented two 98 seat ap1-88 hovercraft were introduced on this route in 1983 , and in 2007 , these were joined by the first 130-seat bht130 craft the ap1-88 and the bht130 were notable as they were largely built by hoverwork using shipbuilding techniques and materials ( i.e welded aluminium structure and diesel engines ) rather than the aircraft techniques used to build the earlier craft built by saunders-roe-british hovercraft corporation one of these models , the hm-2 , was used by red funnel between southampton ( near the woolston floating bridge ) and cowes the world 's first car-carrying hovercraft was made in 1968 , the bhc sr.n4 ( sr.n4 ) models , each powered by four bristol proteus turboshaft engines these were both used by rival operators hoverlloyd and seaspeed ( joined to form hoverspeed in 1981 ) to operate regular car and passenger carrying services across the english channel hovercraft used to ply between the gateway of india in mumbai and cbd belapur and vashi in navi mumbai between 1994 and 1999 , but the services were subsequently stopped due to the lack of sufficient water transport infrastructure in finland , small hovercraft are widely used in maritime rescue and during the rasputitsa ( '' mud season '' ) as archipelago liaison vehicles in england , hovercraft of the burnham-on-sea area rescue boat ( barb ) are used to rescue people from thick mud in bridgwater bay a griffon rescue hovercraft has been in use for a number of years with the airport fire service at dundee airport in scotland it is used in the event of an aircraft ditching in the tay estuary numerous fire departments around the us/canadian great lakes operate hovercraft for water and ice rescues , often of ice fisherman stranded when ice breaks off from shore the canadian coast guard uses hovercraft to break light ice in october 2008 , the red cross commenced a flood-rescue service hovercraft based in inverness , scotland currently , the royal marines use the griffonhoverwork 2400td hovercraft , the replacement for the griffon 2000 tdx class acv which was deployed operationally by the marines in the 2003 invasion of iraq developed and tested in the mid-1970s , the lacv-30 was used by the us army to transport military cargo in logistics-over-the-shore operations from the early 1980s thru the mid 1990s in august 2010 , the hovercraft club of great britain hosted the world hovercraft championships at towcester racecourse the world hovercraft championships are run under the auspices of the world hovercraft federation the tracked hovercraft project and eric laithwaite maglev train system were contemporaneous , and there was intense competition between the two prospective british systems for funding and credibility

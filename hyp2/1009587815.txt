there have been many attempts to understand the principles of high air pressure below hulls and wings hovercraft are unique in that they can lift themselves while still , differing from ground effect vehicles and hydrofoils which require forward motion to create lift the first mention in the historical record of the concepts behind surface-effect vehicles that used the term hovering was by swedish scientist emanuel swedenborg in 1716 the shipbuilder sir john isaac thornycroft patented an early design for an air cushion ship / hovercraft in the 1870s , but suitable , powerful , engines were not available until the 20th century in 1915 , the austrian dagobert müller von thomamühl ( 1880–1956 ) built the world 's first '' air cushion '' boat only when in motion could the craft trap air under the front , increasing lift the vessel also required a depth of water to operate and could not transition to land or other surfaces it never saw actual combat , however , and as the war progressed it was eventually scrapped due to the lack of interest and perceived need , and its engines returned to the air force the theoretical grounds for motion over an air layer were constructed by konstantin eduardovich tsiolkovskii in 1926 and 1927 several must be used together to support a load above them he initially imagined these being used in place of casters and wheels in factories and warehouses , where the concrete floors offered the smoothness required for operation kaario began designing a developed version of a vessel using an air cushion and built a prototype ( 'surface soarer ' ) , in 1937 during world war ii , an american engineer , charles fletcher , invented a walled air cushion vehicle , the glidemobile this produced a ring of airflow , as expected , but he noticed an unexpected benefit as well ; the sheet of fast moving air presented a sort of physical barrier to the air on either side of it in terms of power , a hovercraft would only need between one quarter to one half of the power required by a helicopter cockerell built and tested several models of his hovercraft design in somerleyton , suffolk , during the early 1950s he demonstrated the model flying over many whitehall carpets in front of various government experts and ministers , and the design was subsequently put on the secret list in addition to providing the lift air , a portion of the airflow was bled off into two channels on either side of the craft , which could be directed to provide thrust in normal operation this extra airflow was directed rearward for forward thrust , and blew over two large vertical rudders that provided directional control for low-speed maneuverability , the extra thrust could be directed fore or aft , differentially for rotation the sr.n1 made its first hover on 11 june 1959 , and made its famed successful crossing of the english channel on 25 july 1959 a turbomeca marboré turbojet for forward thrust and two large vertical rudders for directional control were added , producing the sr.n1 mk ii further modifications , especially the addition of pointed nose and stern areas , produced the mk iv in 1958 , he suggested the use of two rings of rubber to produce a double-walled extension of the vents in the lower fuselage in october 1961 , latimer-needham sold his skirt patents to westland , who had recently taken over saunders roe 's interest in the hovercraft what actually happened is that the slight narrowing of the distance between the walls resulted in less airflow , which in turn led to more air loss under that section of the skirt after considerable experimentation , denys bliss at hovercraft development ltd over time , this design evolved into individual extensions over the bottom of the slots in the skirt , known as '' fingers '' through these improvements , the hovercraft became an effective transport system for high-speed service on water and land , leading to widespread developments for military vehicles , search and rescue , and commercial operations by 1962 , many uk aviation and ship building firms were working on hovercraft designs , including saunders roe/westland , vickers-armstrong , william denny , britten-norman and folland bertin was an advocate of the '' multi-skirt '' approach , which used a number of smaller cylindrical skirts instead of one large one in order to avoid the problems noted above another discovery was that the total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it travelled over on flat surfaces , like pavement , the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels however , as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension , it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex these designs competed with maglev systems in the high-speed arena , where their primary advantage was the very '' low tech '' tracks they needed on vehicles with several engines , one usually drives the fan ( or impeller ) , which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft the air inflates the '' skirt '' under the vehicle , causing it to rise above the surface additional engines provide thrust in order to propel the craft latimer-needham , who sold his idea to westland ( by then the parent of saunders-roe 's helicopter and hovercraft interests ) , and who worked with cockerell to develop the idea further the first passenger-carrying hovercraft to enter service was the vickers va-3 , which , in the summer of 1962 , carried passengers regularly along the north wales coast from moreton , merseyside , to rhyl during the 1960s , saunders-roe developed several larger designs that could carry passengers , including the sr.n2 , which operated across the solent , in 1962 , and later the sr.n6 , which operated across the solent from southsea to ryde on the isle of wight for many years in 1963 the sr.n2 was used in experimental service between weston-super-mare and penarth under the aegis of p & a campbell , the paddle steamer operators welded aluminium structure and diesel engines ) rather than the aircraft techniques used to build the earlier craft built by saunders-roe-british hovercraft corporation one of these models , the hm-2 , was used by red funnel between southampton ( near the woolston floating bridge ) and cowes the world 's first car-carrying hovercraft was made in 1968 , the bhc sr.n4 ( sr.n4 ) models , each powered by four bristol proteus turboshaft engines the channel crossing took around 30 & nbsp ; minutes and was run like an airline with flight numbers numerous fire departments around the us/canadian great lakes operate hovercraft for water and ice rescues , often of ice fisherman stranded when ice breaks off from shore marketed as forthfast , the service used a craft chartered from hovertravel and achieved an 85 % passenger load factor it proved an extremely successful design for a littoral fast attack craft , but due to fiscal reasons and doctrinal change in the navy , the hovercraft was soon withdrawn the hovercraft club of great britain , founded in 1966 , regularly organizes inland and coastal hovercraft race events at various venues across the united kingdom a real benefit of air cushion vehicles in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain , such as swamps , was overlooked by the excitement of the british government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft the project was managed by tracked hovercraft ltd department of transport 's federal transit administration ( umta ) funded several hovertrain projects , which were known as tracked air cushion vehicles or tacvs the hovercraft museum at lee-on-the-solent , hampshire , england , houses the world 's largest collection of hovercraft designs , including some of the earliest and largest this hovercraft can transport three t-80 main battle tanks ( mbt ) , 140 fully equipped troops , or up to 130 & nbsp ; tons of cargo

standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area luther based his translation largely on the already developed language of the saxon chancery , which was more widely understood than other dialects and as a central german dialect , was felt to be '' half way '' between the dialects of the north and south until about 1800 , standard german was almost entirely a written language people in northern germany who spoke mainly low saxon languages very different from standard german then learned it more or less as a foreign language it is thus the spread of standard german as a language taught at school that defines the german sprachraum , which was thus a political decision rather than a direct consequence of dialect geography the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german in formal writing the differences are minimal to nonexistent ; in regards to the spoken language , the different varieties of standard german are easily recognized by most speakers continuum between standard german and german dialects since the former have not undergone the high german consonant shift , they are too different from the standard for a continuum to emerge high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german standard german is seldom spoken among native swiss , and even then the accent and vocabulary is very much swiss , except for instance when speaking with people who do not understand the swiss german dialects at all , and it is expected to be used in school duden does codify the standard pronunciation for german standard german , allowing for a small number of divergences : for example , the string '' äh '' has two authorized pronunciations , /ɛː/ and /eː/

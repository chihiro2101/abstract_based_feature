standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area luther bible in 1522 was an important development towards an early standardization of written german luther drew principally on eastern upper and east central german dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of middle high german people in northern germany who spoke mainly low saxon languages very different from standard german then learned it more or less as a foreign language however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers in german , standard german is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the high german spoken in the southern uplands and the alps ( including austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and south tyrol as well as southern germany ) the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) on the other hand , the '' standard '' written languages of switzerland and austria have each been codified as standards distinct from that used in germany for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german these three national standards ( german , swiss , and austrian ) have each been adopted by other german-speaking countries and communities as their standard form of german even though the standard german varieties are to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects , they are very distinct continuum between standard german and german dialects in german-speaking switzerland , there is no such continuum between the swiss german varieties and swiss standard german , and the use of standard german is almost entirely restricted to the written language

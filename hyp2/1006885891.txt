standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area luther drew principally on eastern upper and east central german dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of middle high german until about 1800 , standard german was almost entirely a written language currently , local dialects are used mainly in informal situations or at home and also in dialect literature , but more recently , a resurgence of german dialects has appeared in mass media in german , standard german is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the high german spoken in the southern uplands and the alps ( including austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and south tyrol as well as southern germany ) the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german in formal writing the differences are minimal to nonexistent ; in regards to the spoken language , the different varieties of standard german are easily recognized by most speakers these three national standards ( german , swiss , and austrian ) have each been adopted by other german-speaking countries and communities as their standard form of german continuum between standard german and german dialects high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german high german heavily influenced by low german has been known as missingsch , but most contemporary northern germans exhibit only an intermediate low german substratum in their speech standard german has , however , left a clear imprint on the contemporary variants of swiss german , regional expressions and vocabulary having been replaced with material assimilated from the standard language

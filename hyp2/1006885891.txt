luther drew principally on eastern upper and east central german dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of middle high german until about 1800 , standard german was almost entirely a written language people in northern germany who spoke mainly low saxon languages very different from standard german then learned it more or less as a foreign language however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers in german , standard german is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the high german spoken in the southern uplands and the alps ( including austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and south tyrol as well as southern germany ) standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german these three national standards ( german , swiss , and austrian ) have each been adopted by other german-speaking countries and communities as their standard form of german even though the standard german varieties are to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects , they are very distinct all varieties of standard german are based on the common tradition of the written german language , whereas the local dialects have their own historical roots that go further back than the unification of the written language , and in the case of low german , belong to a different language entirely high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german under a socio-linguistic approach to the problem , even if low german dialects are abstandsprachen ( linguistically quite different ) , they are dialects of german , because they lack ausbau in german-speaking switzerland , there is no such continuum between the swiss german varieties and swiss standard german , and the use of standard german is almost entirely restricted to the written language standard german has , however , left a clear imprint on the contemporary variants of swiss german , regional expressions and vocabulary having been replaced with material assimilated from the standard language luxembourgish is not considered a german dialect but an independent language ; luxembourgers are generally trilingual , using french and standard german in some areas of life , luxembourgish in others

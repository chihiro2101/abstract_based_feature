standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area over the course of the mid-18th century and onward , a written standard then began to emerge and be widely accepted in german-speaking areas , thus ending the period of early new high german however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) on the other hand , the '' standard '' written languages of switzerland and austria have each been codified as standards distinct from that used in germany for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german in formal writing the differences are minimal to nonexistent ; in regards to the spoken language , the different varieties of standard german are easily recognized by most speakers these three national standards ( german , swiss , and austrian ) have each been adopted by other german-speaking countries and communities as their standard form of german the variation of the standard german varieties must not be confused with the variation of the local german dialects continuum between standard german and german dialects high german and low german are best seen as separate languages , but because high , middle , and low german form a dialect continuum and standard german serves as dachsprache for all forms of german , they are often described as dialects of german under a socio-linguistic approach to the problem , even if low german dialects are abstandsprachen ( linguistically quite different ) , they are dialects of german , because they lack ausbau in german-speaking switzerland , there is no such continuum between the swiss german varieties and swiss standard german , and the use of standard german is almost entirely restricted to the written language

standard german originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area luther drew principally on eastern upper and east central german dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of middle high german until about 1800 , standard german was almost entirely a written language people in northern germany who spoke mainly low saxon languages very different from standard german then learned it more or less as a foreign language however , later the northern pronunciation ( of standard german ) was considered standard and spread southward ; in some regions ( such as around hanover ) , the local dialect has completely died out with the exception of small communities of low german speakers in german , standard german is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the high german spoken in the southern uplands and the alps ( including austria , switzerland , liechtenstein and south tyrol as well as southern germany ) the widespread but mistaken impression that hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be '' good german '' has led to use of the supposedly less judgemental ( '' standard german '' ) , ( '' german standard language '' ) for this reason , '' hochdeutsch '' or '' high german '' , originally a mere geographic designation , applies unproblematically to swiss standard german and austrian german as well as to german standard german and may be preferred for that reason standard german is pluricentric with different national varieties , namely : austrian standard german , german standard german , and swiss standard german in formal writing the differences are minimal to nonexistent ; in regards to the spoken language , the different varieties of standard german are easily recognized by most speakers the german standard is applied in luxembourg , belgium , and namibia while the swiss standard has been adopted in liechtenstein continuum between standard german and german dialects standard german has , however , left a clear imprint on the contemporary variants of swiss german , regional expressions and vocabulary having been replaced with material assimilated from the standard language duden does codify the standard pronunciation for german standard german , allowing for a small number of divergences : for example , the string '' äh '' has two authorized pronunciations , /ɛː/ and /eː/

before the royal assent by commission act 1541 allowed for delegation of the power to lords commissioners , assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before parliament the last time it was given by the sovereign in person in parliament was during the reign of queen victoria at a prorogation on 12 august 1854 there was a controversy over the meaning of this phrase : the verb elegerit is ambiguous , representing either the future perfect ( '' which the common people shall have chosen '' ) , or perfect subjunctive ( '' which the common people may have chosen '' ) charles i , adopting the latter interpretation , considered himself committed only to uphold those laws and customs that already existed at the time of his coronation the long parliament preferred the former translation , interpreting the oath as an undertaking to assent to any law passed by parliament , as the representative of the '' common people '' after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills the sedition act 1661 even made it a treasonable offence to suggest that parliament had '' a legislative power without the king '' in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill '' for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , '' '' house of lords journal volume 13 : 27 november 1678 '' one contemporary observer reported that william 's veto was recommended by the judges themselves , concerned that the regulation of their fees would deprive them of a lucrative source of income a similar law , without the requirement for annual parliamentary sessions , was approved by the king in 1694 and became law the place bill ( vetoed 1694 ) would have prevented members of parliament from accepting any office or employment under the crown without standing for re-election the qualifications bill ( vetoed 1696 ) would have established property qualifications for members of parliament carafano suggests that william iii considered the royal veto '' his personal legislative tool '' by contrast , the last stuart monarch , anne , withheld her assent from a bill just once no monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by parliament during the rule of the succeeding house of hanover , power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government however , george iv reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the united kingdom and in the other commonwealth realms after a bill has been passed , the presiding officer of the scottish parliament submits it to the monarch for royal assent after a four-week period , during which the advocate general for scotland , the lord advocate , the attorney general or the secretary of state for scotland '' stage of a bill '' royal assent is signified by letters patent under the great seal of scotland as set out in the scottish parliament ( letters patent and proclamations ) order 1999 ( si 1999/737 ) and of which notice is published in the london , edinburgh , and belfast gazettes following the referendum held in march 2011 , in which the majority vote for the assembly 's law-making powers to be extended , measures were replaced by acts of the assembly the equivalent of the royal assent is formally granted or formally refused on the formal advice of the committee of council for the affairs of jersey and guernsey in pursuance of queen elizabeth ii 's order-in-council of 22 february 1952 , letter from duke of atholl , 11 june 1757 , allowing and confirming an act to prevent clandestine marriages : after 1765 , the equivalent of the royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the secretary of state to the governor ; e.g , letter from duke of portland ( secretary of state ) to duke of atholl ( governor ) , 15 july 1796 , advising of the king 's approval to two acts but withholding assent to a third : op cit p.352 but , during the british regency , the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to manx legislation by orders in council , e.g since 1993 , the sodor and man diocesan synod of the church of england within the province of york has had power to enact measures making provision '' with respect to any matter concerning the church of england in the island '' if approved by the tynwald , a measure '' shall have the force and effect of an act of tynwald upon the royal assent thereto being announced to the tynwald '' church ( application of general synod measures ) act 1979 before 1994 , the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by order in council , as for a bill , but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor in commonwealth realms other than the uk , royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm 's sovereign or , more frequently , by the representative of the sovereign , the governor-general a lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general , and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign in the united states declaration of independence , colonists complained that george iii '' has refused his assent to laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good and has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them since the balfour declaration of 1926 and the statute of westminster 1931 , all the commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms , the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers , who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills bowen , in 1937 , in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by william aberhart 's social credit party in 1976 , a bill originating in the house of representatives was mistakenly submitted to the governor-general and assented to under the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 , the house of commons may , under certain circumstances , direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the house of lords '' once a bill has completed all the parliamentary stages in both houses , it is ready to receive royal assent '' , bill becomes an act of parliament a list of all bills that have thus passed parliament is drawn up by the clerk of the crown in chancery ; this list is then approved by the clerk of the parliaments ( the prime minister , other ministers , and privy councillors do not normally have any involvement in drawing up the list officially , assent is granted by the sovereign or by lords commissioners authorised to act by letters patent before the reign of henry viii , the sovereign always granted his or her assent in person the sovereign , wearing the imperial state crown , would be seated on the throne in the lords chamber , surrounded by heralds and members of the royal courtâ€”a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual state opening of parliament thus , unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by royal commissioners , the method created by the royal assent act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent a similar practice is followed in new zealand , where the governor-general has not granted the royal assent in person in parliament since 1875 the royal assent ceremony takes place in the senate , as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the house of commons in belgium , the royal assent is called sanction royale / koninklijke bekrachtiging ( royal sanction ) , and is granted by the king signing the proposed statute ( and a minister countersigning it ) no constitutional provision allows the monarch to directly veto legislation ; however , neither does the constitution prohibit the sovereign from withholding royal assent

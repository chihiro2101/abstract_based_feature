assent on a bill passed by parliament later hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation : george iii and george iv both openly opposed catholic emancipation conway , stephen thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the united kingdom and in the other commonwealth realms he decided to not withhold assent without '' convincing evidence that it would avert a national disaster , or at least have a tranquillising effect on the distracting conditions of the time '' royal

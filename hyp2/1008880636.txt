before the royal assent by commission act 1541 allowed for delegation of the power to lords commissioners , assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before parliament the last time it was given by the sovereign in person in parliament was during the reign of queen victoria at a prorogation on 12 august 1854 the long parliament preferred the former translation , interpreting the oath as an undertaking to assent to any law passed by parliament , as the representative of the '' common people '' after the english civil war , it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly , but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills in 1678 , charles ii withheld his assent from a bill '' for preserving the peace of the kingdom by raising the militia , and continuing them in duty for two and forty days , '' '' house of lords journal volume 13 : 27 november 1678 '' the royal mines bill ( vetoed 1692 ) would have clearly defined the monarch 's right to seize any mine containing gold or silver a similar bill was again passed by parliament and given royal assent in the following year the triennial bill ( vetoed 1693 ) would have ensured parliament would meet annually , and that no parliament could last longer than three years the place bill ( vetoed 1694 ) would have prevented members of parliament from accepting any office or employment under the crown without standing for re-election no monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by parliament the institute of historical research , february 2003 however , george iv reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers thus , as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved , the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse , both in the united kingdom and in the other commonwealth realms in 1914 , george v took legal advice on withholding royal assent from the home rule act 1914 ; then highly contentious legislation that the liberal government intended to push through parliament by means of the parliament act 1911 may refer the bill to the supreme court of the united kingdom ( prior to 1 october 2009 , the judicial committee of the privy council ) for review of its legality royal assent is signified by letters patent under the great seal of scotland as set out in the scottish parliament ( letters patent and proclamations ) order 1999 ( si 1999/737 ) and of which notice is published in the london , edinburgh , and belfast gazettes order in council dated 9 july 2008 , approving the nhs redress ( wales ) measure 2008 , the first measure to be passed by the assembly on 6 may 2008 assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the northern ireland ( royal assent to bills ) order 1999 between 1922 and 1972 , bills passed by the parliament of northern ireland were passed to the governor of northern ireland for royal assent under the government of ireland act 1920 , replacing the office of lord lieutenant the equivalent of the royal assent is formally granted or formally refused on the formal advice of the committee of council for the affairs of jersey and guernsey in pursuance of queen elizabeth ii 's order-in-council of 22 february 1952 a recent example when the equivalent of the royal assent was refused was in 2007 , concerning reforms to the constitution of the sark chief pleas , letter from duke of atholl , 11 june 1757 , allowing and confirming an act to prevent clandestine marriages : after 1765 , the equivalent of the royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the secretary of state to the governor ; e.g cit p.352 but , during the british regency , the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to manx legislation by orders in council , e.g p.381 which continues to this day , though limited to exceptional cases since 1981 that year an order in council delegated to the lieutenant governor the power to grant royal assent to bills passed by tynwald church ( application of general synod measures ) act 1979 before 1994 , the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by order in council , as for a bill , but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor sodor and man diocesan synod measures order 1994 a measure does not require promulgation in commonwealth realms other than the uk , royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm 's sovereign or , more frequently , by the representative of the sovereign , the governor-general a lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general , and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign if the governor general of canada is unable to give assent , it can be done by either the deputy of the governor general of canada—the chief justice of canada—or another justice of the supreme court of canada two methods are available : the sovereign 's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament ;

in the latter case , each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect for personal bills , the phrase is '' soit fait comme il est désiré '' ( '' let it be done as it is desired '' ) in 1960 , the gentleman usher of the black rod arrived to summon the house of commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony thus , unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by royal commissioners , the method created by the royal assent act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent independently of the method used to signify royal assent , it is the responsibility of the clerk of the parliaments , once the assent has been duly notified to both houses , not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal norman french formula , but to certify that assent has been granted a similar practice is followed in new zealand , where the governor-general has not granted the royal assent in person in parliament since 1875 articles 77–79 of the norwegian constitution specifically grant the monarch of norway the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the storting according to article 91 , the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the cortes generales . royal assent , uk parliament

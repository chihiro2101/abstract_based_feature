chodkiewicz was born around 1561 ( exact date of his birth is unknown ) as the son of jan hieronimowicz chodkiewicz , grand marshal of lithuania , castellan of vilnius and krystyna zborowska , daughter of a polish magnate family of zborowscy he visited padua before returning to the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in 1590 chodkiewicz subsequently assisted chancellor and great crown hetman jan zamoyski in his victorious wallachian campaign , in which chodkiewicz participated in the battle of ploiești on 15 october 1600 for that campaign , he was given that year the high office of the field lithuanian hetman , the second commander-in-chief of the lithuanian detachment of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth army a year later , in 1601 , chodkiewicz accompanied zamoyski north , to the duchy of livonia ( inflanty ) , where he commanded lithuanian units on the right wing of the commonwealth army in a victorious battle of kokenhausen in late july that year in the war against sweden yet this great victory was virtually fruitless , owing to the domestic dissensions ; the sejm ( commonwealth parliament ) failed to agree on raising the funds needed for the war effort he commanded the right wing of the royal army during the battle of guzów on 6–7 july 1607 , in which the insurgents were defeated , and then quelled the unrest in the grand duchy of lithuania , fighting against another rebellious magnate , janusz radziwiłł , until radziwiłł negotiated a settlement with the king in 1608 instigated by king zygmunt , the war was unpopular among lithuanian magnates , and chodkiewicz was no exception ; in fact his displeasure was so public and significant that he lost the royal favor for a time thumb the polish-muscovite war had no sooner been ended by the treaty of deulino than chodkiewicz was hastily dispatched southwards to defend the southern frontier against the turks , who , in the opening phase of the polish–ottoman war , defeated polish forces at cecora , killing hetman żółkiewski he strongly believed his service for the state should be rewarded with land grants , but at the same time he would often use his own money to pay for the army 's military expenses

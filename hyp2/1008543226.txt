right in embryophyte , plastids that contain chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis and are called chloroplasts plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules plant proplastids ( undifferentiated plastids ) may differentiate into several forms , depending upon which function they perform in the cell they may develop into any of the following variants : chloroplasts : typically green plastids used for photosynthesis the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins , and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to cell differentiation plastid types in algae and protists include : chloroplasts : found in the green algae and other organisms in red algae , floridean starch is synthesized and stored outside the plastids in the cytosol the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and is used in photosynthesis ; it had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90â€“140 million years ago , and is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids as an example , in chloroplasts of the moss physcomitrella patens , a protein employed in dna mismatch repair ( msh1 ) interacts with proteins employed in recombinational repair ( reca and recg ) to maintain plastid genome stability the primary endosymbiotic event of the archaeplastida is hypothesized to have occurred around 1.5 billion years ago and enabled eukaryotes to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis three evolutionary lineages in the archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , rhodoplasts in red algae , and muroplasts in the glaucophytes the plastid was a sister to the '' ps-clade '' ( of the cyanobacteria genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus ) , which is a different sister clade to the plastids belonging to the archaeplastida some dinoflagellates and sea slugs , in particular of the genus elysia , take up algae as food and keep the plastid of the digested alga to profit from the photosynthesis ; after a while , the plastids are also digested

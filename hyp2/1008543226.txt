right in embryophyte , plastids that contain chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis and are called chloroplasts plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules for example , the components of the plant cuticle and its epicuticular wax are synthesized by the epidermal cells from palmitic acid , which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll tissue proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission , but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity plant proplastids ( undifferentiated plastids ) may differentiate into several forms , depending upon which function they perform in the cell they may develop into any of the following variants : chloroplasts : typically green plastids used for photosynthesis each plastid creates multiple copies of a circular 10â€“250 kilobase plastome plastid types in algae and protists include : chloroplasts : found in the green algae and other organisms secondary and tertiary chloroplasts : from endosymbiosis of green algae and red algae leucoplast : in algae , the term is used for all unpigmented plastids plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids dna repair proteins are encoded by the cell 's nuclear genome but can be translocated to plastids where they maintain genome stability/integrity by repairing the plastid 's dna plastids are thought to be endosymbiosis cyanobacteria the plastid was a sister to the '' ps-clade '' ( of the cyanobacteria genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus ) , which is a different sister clade to the plastids belonging to the archaeplastida the apicomplexa , a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria ( plasmodium spp

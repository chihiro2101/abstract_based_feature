right in embryophyte , plastids that contain chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis and are called chloroplasts plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules for example , the components of the plant cuticle and its epicuticular wax are synthesized by the epidermal cells from palmitic acid , which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll tissue they may develop into any of the following variants : chloroplasts : typically green plastids used for photosynthesis the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins , and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to cell differentiation during the development of proplastids to chloroplasts , and when plastids convert from one type to another , nucleoids change in morphology , size and location within the organelle in plant cells , long thin protuberances called stromules sometimes form and extend from the main plastid body into the cytosol and interconnect several plastids most cultured cells that are relatively large compared to other plant cells have very long and abundant stromules that extend to the cell periphery secondary and tertiary chloroplasts : from endosymbiosis of green algae and red algae the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and is used in photosynthesis ; it had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90â€“140 million years ago , and is the only other known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria for example , chloroplasts in plants and green algae have lost all phycobilisomes , the light harvesting complexes found in cyanobacteria , red algae and glaucophytes , but instead contain stroma and grana thylakoids in contrast to primary plastids derived from primary endosymbiosis of a prokaryoctyic cyanobacteria , complex plastids originated by secondary endosymbiosis in which a eukaryotic organism engulfed another eukaryotic organism that contained a primary plastid algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts , haptophytes , cryptomonads , and most dinoflagellates ( rhodoplasts ) some dinoflagellates and sea slugs , in particular of the genus elysia , take up algae as food and keep the plastid of the digested alga to profit from the photosynthesis ; after a while , the plastids are also digested

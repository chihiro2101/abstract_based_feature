right in embryophyte , plastids that contain chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis and are called chloroplasts plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules they may develop into any of the following variants : chloroplasts : typically green plastids used for photosynthesis the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids plastid dna exists as large protein-dna complexes associated with the inner envelope membrane and called 'plastid nucleoids ' in plant cells , long thin protuberances called stromules sometimes form and extend from the main plastid body into the cytosol and interconnect several plastids in 2014 , evidence of possible plastid genome loss was found in rafflesia lagascae , a non-photosynthetic parasitic flowering plant , and in polytomella , a genus of non-photosynthetic green algae some scientists argue that plastid genome loss is unlikely since even non-photosynthetic plastids contain genes necessary to complete various biosynthesis , such as heme biosynthesis in red algae , floridean starch is synthesized and stored outside the plastids in the cytosol secondary and tertiary chloroplasts : from endosymbiosis of green algae and red algae plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids dna repair proteins are encoded by the cell 's nuclear genome but can be translocated to plastids where they maintain genome stability/integrity by repairing the plastid 's dna three evolutionary lineages in the archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , rhodoplasts in red algae , and muroplasts in the glaucophytes the plastid of photosynthetic paulinella species is often referred to as the 'cyanelle ' or chromatophore , and had a much more recent endosymbiotic event about 90â€“140 million years ago ; it is the only known primary endosymbiosis event of cyanobacteria outside of the archaeplastida the plastid was a sister to the '' ps-clade '' ( of the cyanobacteria genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus ) , which is a different sister clade to the plastids belonging to the archaeplastida

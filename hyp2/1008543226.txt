right in embryophyte , plastids that contain chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis and are called chloroplasts plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes , which can be used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules plant proplastids ( undifferentiated plastids ) may differentiate into several forms , depending upon which function they perform in the cell they may develop into any of the following variants : chloroplasts : typically green plastids used for photosynthesis the number of genome copies per plastid is variable , ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly cell division , which , in general , contain few plastids , to 100 or fewer in mature cells , where plastid divisions have given rise to a large number of plastids plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins , and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to cell differentiation plastid dna exists as large protein-dna complexes associated with the inner envelope membrane and called 'plastid nucleoids ' the developing plastid has many nucleoids , localized at the periphery of the plastid , bound to the inner envelope membrane during the development of proplastids to chloroplasts , and when plastids convert from one type to another , nucleoids change in morphology , size and location within the organelle plastid types in algae and protists include : chloroplasts : found in the green algae and other organisms secondary and tertiary chloroplasts : from endosymbiosis of green algae and red algae plastids in algae and hornworts may also differ from plant plastids in that they contain pyrenoids dna repair proteins are encoded by the cell 's nuclear genome but can be translocated to plastids where they maintain genome stability/integrity by repairing the plastid 's dna three evolutionary lineages in the archaeplastida have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently : chloroplasts in green algae and plants , rhodoplasts in red algae , and muroplasts in the glaucophytes algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts , haptophytes , cryptomonads , and most dinoflagellates ( rhodoplasts )

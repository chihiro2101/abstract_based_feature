) left the exterior parts of this machine are a compages or framework of brass rings , which represent the principal circles of the heavens the equinoctial a , which is divided into 360 degrees ( beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in aries ) for showing the sun 's right ascension in degrees ; and also into 24 hours , for showing its right ascension in time the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the tropic of cancer c , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of cancer in e , and the tropic of capricorn d , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of capricorn in f ; each 23½ degrees from the equinoctial circle each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees , from the equinoctial to the poles of the world , for showing the declination of the sun , moon , and stars ; and each quarter of the latter , from the ecliptic as e and f , to its poles b and d , for showing the latitude of the stars within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s on this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian l l , which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe , so as to keep over the same meridian upon it to this globe is fitted the movable horizon m , so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe , and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator , which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator the globe may be turned by hand within this ring , so as to place any given meridian upon it , directly under the celestial meridian l the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it at the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours , fixed to the rings , and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle , if the globe be turned round its axis in the box t are two wheels ( as in dr long 's sphere ) and two pinions , whose axes come out at v and u ; either of which may be turned by the small winch w when the winch is put upon the axis v , and turn backward , the terrestrial globe , with its horizon and celestial meridian , keep at rest ; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east , by south , to west , carrying the sun y , and moon z , round the same way , and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon — then turn the winch , and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon , and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument 39–53 ( 45 ) during the western han dynasty ( 202 bc9 ad ) additional developments made by the astronomers luoxia hong ( : zh : 落下閎 ) , xiangyu wangren , and geng shouchang ( 耿壽昌 ) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution in 52 bc , it was the astronomer geng shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere in 323 ad the chinese astronomer kong ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired he was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes however , it was the tang chinese astronomer , mathematician , and monk yi xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of zhou cong and shu yijian in 1050 , as well as shen kuo 's armillary sphere of the later 11th century , but after that point they were no longer employed on chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the european jesuits image : chinesecelestialglobe.jpg thumbnail upright celestial globe from the qing dynasty in 723 ad , yi xing ( 一行 ) and government official liang ling-zan ( 梁令瓚 ) combined zhang heng 's water powered celestial globe with an escapement device 120 bc ) credited eratosthenes ( 276194 bc ) as the inventor of the armillary sphere couprie , robert hahn , gerard naddaf : anaximander in context : new studies in the origins of greek philosophy , 2003 , , p before the advent of the european telescope in the 17th century , the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions abbas ibn firnas ( d.887 ) is thought to have produced another instrument with rings ( armillary sphere ) in the 9th century which he gave to caliph muhammad i ( ruled 852–886 ) the armillary sphere was reintroduced to western europe via al-andalus in the late 10th century with the efforts of gerbert d'aurillac , the later pope sylvester ii ( r the armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching , and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe , the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens , and revolving on an axis within a horizon representing brazil , the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves

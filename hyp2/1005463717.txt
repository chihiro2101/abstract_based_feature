the equinoctial a , which is divided into 360 degrees ( beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in aries ) for showing the sun 's right ascension in degrees ; and also into 24 hours , for showing its right ascension in time the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the tropic of cancer c , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of cancer in e , and the tropic of capricorn d , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of capricorn in f ; each 23½ degrees from the equinoctial circle within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s to this globe is fitted the movable horizon m , so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe , and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator , which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator the globe may be turned by hand within this ring , so as to place any given meridian upon it , directly under the celestial meridian l the horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge , within which are the points of the compass , for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon , both in degrees and points the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it at the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours , fixed to the rings , and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle , if the globe be turned round its axis when the winch is put upon the axis v , and turn backward , the terrestrial globe , with its horizon and celestial meridian , keep at rest ; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east , by south , to west , carrying the sun y , and moon z , round the same way , and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon if the earthly globe be turned , the hour-index goes round its hour-circle ; but if the sphere be turned , the hour-circle goes round below the index — then turn the winch , and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon , and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day the chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendar computations and calculations according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument 39–53 ( 45 ) during the western han dynasty ( 202 bc9 ad ) additional developments made by the astronomers luoxia hong ( : zh : 落下閎 ) , xiangyu wangren , and geng shouchang ( 耿壽昌 ) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution the world 's first water-powered celestial globe was created by zhang heng , who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock ( see zhang 's article for more detail ) subsequent developments were made after the han dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere in 323 ad the chinese astronomer kong ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired he was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes however , it was the tang chinese astronomer , mathematician , and monk yi xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of zhou cong and shu yijian in 1050 , as well as shen kuo 's armillary sphere of the later 11th century , but after that point they were no longer employed on chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the european jesuits sivin , iii , 17 when jamal al-din of bukhara was asked to set up an 'islamic astronomical institution ' in khubilai khan 's new capital during the yuan dynasty , he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments , including an armillary sphere before the advent of the european telescope in the 17th century , the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions when several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens , the instrument became an armillary sphere the armillary sphere was reintroduced to western europe via al-andalus in the late 10th century with the efforts of gerbert d'aurillac , the later pope sylvester ii ( r the mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of sejong era 's armillary sphere ( honŭi 渾儀 , 1435 ) and celestial sphere ( honsang 渾象 , 1435 ) , and the jade clepsydra ( ongnu 玉漏 , 1438 ) 's sun-carriage apparatus in particular , timing device of song i-yŏng 's armillary clock adopts the early 17th century pendulum clock system which could remarkably improve the accuracy of a clock 1750 a representation of an armillary sphere is present in the modern flag of portugal and has been a national symbol since the reign of manuel i the celestial sphere of the present flag of brazil replaced the armillary sphere in 1889

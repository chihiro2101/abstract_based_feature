) left the exterior parts of this machine are a compages or framework of brass rings , which represent the principal circles of the heavens the equinoctial a , which is divided into 360 degrees ( beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in aries ) for showing the sun 's right ascension in degrees ; and also into 24 hours , for showing its right ascension in time the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the equinoctial colure g , passing through the north and south poles of the heaven at n and s , and through the equinoctial points aries and libra , in the ecliptic each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees , from the equinoctial to the poles of the world , for showing the declination of the sun , moon , and stars ; and each quarter of the latter , from the ecliptic as e and f , to its poles b and d , for showing the latitude of the stars within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s on this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian l l , which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe , so as to keep over the same meridian upon it to this globe is fitted the movable horizon m , so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe , and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator , which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator the globe may be turned by hand within this ring , so as to place any given meridian upon it , directly under the celestial meridian l the horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge , within which are the points of the compass , for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon , both in degrees and points the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it at the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours , fixed to the rings , and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle , if the globe be turned round its axis image : clock tower from su song 's book desmear.jpg thumb upright the original diagram of su song 's book of 1092 showing the inner workings of his clocktower ; a escapement armillary sphere crowns the top the chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendar computations and calculations this would have allowed them to measure the north polar distance ( declination ) a measurement that gave the position in a xiu ( right ascension ) christopher cullen , '' joseph needham on chinese astronomy '' , past and present , no in 52 bc , it was the astronomer geng shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere with the famous statesman , astronomer , and inventor zhang heng ( 張衡 , 78–139 ad ) , the sphere was totally complete in 125 ad , with horizon and meridian rings subsequent developments were made after the han dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of zhou cong and shu yijian in 1050 , as well as shen kuo 's armillary sphere of the later 11th century , but after that point they were no longer employed on chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the european jesuits the english name of this device comes ultimately from the latin armilla ( circle , bracelet ) , since it has a skeleton made of graduated metal circles linking the poles and representing the equator , the ecliptic , meridians and parallels when several rings or circles were combined representing the great circles of the heavens , the instrument became an armillary sphere however , the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century ad , during the roman empire jang yeong-sil , a korean inventor , was ordered by king sejong the great of joseon to build an armillary sphere the honcheonsigye , an armillary sphere activated by a working clock mechanism was built by the korean astronomer song iyeong in 1669 the mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of sejong era 's armillary sphere ( honŭi 渾儀 , 1435 ) and celestial sphere ( honsang 渾象 , 1435 ) , and the jade clepsydra ( ongnu 玉漏 , 1438 ) 's sun-carriage apparatus 1750 a representation of an armillary sphere is present in the modern flag of portugal and has been a national symbol since the reign of manuel i an artwork-based model of an armillary sphere has been used since the march 1 , 2014 to light the paralympic heritage flame at stoke mandeville stadium , united kingdom representing brazil , the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves

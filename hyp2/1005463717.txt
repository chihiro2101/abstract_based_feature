the equinoctial a , which is divided into 360 degrees ( beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in aries ) for showing the sun 's right ascension in degrees ; and also into 24 hours , for showing its right ascension in time the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the tropic of cancer c , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of cancer in e , and the tropic of capricorn d , touching the ecliptic at the beginning of capricorn in f ; each 23½ degrees from the equinoctial circle the equinoctial colure g , passing through the north and south poles of the heaven at n and s , and through the equinoctial points aries and libra , in the ecliptic the solstitial colure h , passing through the poles of the heaven , and through the solstitial points cancer and capricorn , in the ecliptic each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees , from the equinoctial to the poles of the world , for showing the declination of the sun , moon , and stars ; and each quarter of the latter , from the ecliptic as e and f , to its poles b and d , for showing the latitude of the stars within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s on this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian l l , which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe , so as to keep over the same meridian upon it the globe may be turned by hand within this ring , so as to place any given meridian upon it , directly under the celestial meridian l the horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge , within which are the points of the compass , for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon , both in degrees and points the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it at the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours , fixed to the rings , and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle , if the globe be turned round its axis the whole fabric is supported on a pedestal n , and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint o , to any number of degrees from 0 to 90 , by means of the arc p , which is fixed in the strong brass arm q , and slides in the upright piece r , in which is a screw at r , to fix it at any proper elevation in the box t are two wheels ( as in dr long 's sphere ) and two pinions , whose axes come out at v and u ; either of which may be turned by the small winch w when the winch is put upon the axis v , and turn backward , the terrestrial globe , with its horizon and celestial meridian , keep at rest ; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east , by south , to west , carrying the sun y , and moon z , round the same way , and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon if the earthly globe be turned , the hour-index goes round its hour-circle ; but if the sphere be turned , the hour-circle goes round below the index — then turn the winch , and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon , and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day the chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendar computations and calculations according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument with the famous statesman , astronomer , and inventor zhang heng ( 張衡 , 78–139 ad ) , the sphere was totally complete in 125 ad , with horizon and meridian rings the world 's first water-powered celestial globe was created by zhang heng , who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock ( see zhang 's article for more detail ) subsequent developments were made after the han dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere in 323 ad the chinese astronomer kong ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired the chinese astronomer and mathematician li chunfeng ( 李淳風 ) of the tang dynasty created one in 633 ad with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations , calling them 'nests ' ( chhung ) however , it was the tang chinese astronomer , mathematician , and monk yi xing in the next century who would accomplish this addition to the model of the armillary sphere jang yeong-sil , a korean inventor , was ordered by king sejong the great of joseon to build an armillary sphere the mechanism of the armillary sphere succeeded that of sejong era 's armillary sphere ( honŭi 渾儀 , 1435 ) and celestial sphere ( honsang 渾象 , 1435 ) , and the jade clepsydra ( ongnu 玉漏 , 1438 ) 's sun-carriage apparatus an artwork-based model of an armillary sphere has been used since the march 1 , 2014 to light the paralympic heritage flame at stoke mandeville stadium , united kingdom the celestial sphere of the present flag of brazil replaced the armillary sphere in 1889

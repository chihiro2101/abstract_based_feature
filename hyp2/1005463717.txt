) left the exterior parts of this machine are a compages or framework of brass rings , which represent the principal circles of the heavens the equinoctial a , which is divided into 360 degrees ( beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in aries ) for showing the sun 's right ascension in degrees ; and also into 24 hours , for showing its right ascension in time the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the equinoctial colure g , passing through the north and south poles of the heaven at n and s , and through the equinoctial points aries and libra , in the ecliptic each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees , from the equinoctial to the poles of the world , for showing the declination of the sun , moon , and stars ; and each quarter of the latter , from the ecliptic as e and f , to its poles b and d , for showing the latitude of the stars within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s on this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian l l , which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe , so as to keep over the same meridian upon it to this globe is fitted the movable horizon m , so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe , and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator , which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it at the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours , fixed to the rings , and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle , if the globe be turned round its axis image : clock tower from su song 's book desmear.jpg thumb upright the original diagram of su song 's book of 1092 showing the inner workings of his clocktower ; a escapement armillary sphere crowns the top throughout china history , astronomers have created celestial globes to assist the observation of the stars the chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendar computations and calculations according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument in the subsequent eastern han dynasty ( 23–220 ad ) period , the astronomers fu an and jia kui added the ecliptic ring by 84 ad with the famous statesman , astronomer , and inventor zhang heng ( 張衡 , 78–139 ad ) , the sphere was totally complete in 125 ad , with horizon and meridian rings the world 's first water-powered celestial globe was created by zhang heng , who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock ( see zhang 's article for more detail ) subsequent developments were made after the han dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere he was also responsible for proposing a plan of having a sighting tube mounted ecliptically in order for the better observation of celestial latitudes ecliptical mountings of this sort were found on the armillary instruments of zhou cong and shu yijian in 1050 , as well as shen kuo 's armillary sphere of the later 11th century , but after that point they were no longer employed on chinese armillary instruments until the arrival of the european jesuits sivin , iii , 17 when jamal al-din of bukhara was asked to set up an 'islamic astronomical institution ' in khubilai khan 's new capital during the yuan dynasty , he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments , including an armillary sphere usually a ball representing the earth or , later , the sun is placed in its center before the advent of the european telescope in the 17th century , the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions however , the fully developed armillary sphere with nine circles perhaps did not exist until the mid-2nd century ad , during the roman empire abbas ibn firnas ( d.887 ) is thought to have produced another instrument with rings ( armillary sphere ) in the 9th century which he gave to caliph muhammad i ( ruled 852–886 ) muslim astronomers also independently invented the celestial globe , which were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy the armillary sphere survives as useful for teaching , and may be described as a skeleton celestial globe , the series of rings representing the great circles of the heavens , and revolving on an axis within a horizon representing brazil , the armillary sphere became also present in the arms and the flag of the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves the celestial sphere of the present flag of brazil replaced the armillary sphere in 1889

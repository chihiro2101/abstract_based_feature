) left the exterior parts of this machine are a compages or framework of brass rings , which represent the principal circles of the heavens the equinoctial a , which is divided into 360 degrees ( beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in aries ) for showing the sun 's right ascension in degrees ; and also into 24 hours , for showing its right ascension in time the ecliptic b , which is divided into 12 signs , and each sign into 30 degrees , and also into the months and days of the year ; in such a manner , that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is , on any given day , stands over that day in the circle of months the solstitial colure h , passing through the poles of the heaven , and through the solstitial points cancer and capricorn , in the ecliptic within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe i , fixed on an axis k , which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s , to those of the celestial sphere at n and s this flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of the common globe , and its use is much the same the globe may be turned by hand within this ring , so as to place any given meridian upon it , directly under the celestial meridian l the horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge , within which are the points of the compass , for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon , both in degrees and points the celestial meridian l passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon , as in a common globe : both here , if the globe be turned round , the horizon and meridian turn with it in the box t are two wheels ( as in dr long 's sphere ) and two pinions , whose axes come out at v and u ; either of which may be turned by the small winch w if the earthly globe be turned , the hour-index goes round its hour-circle ; but if the sphere be turned , the hour-circle goes round below the index throughout china history , astronomers have created celestial globes to assist the observation of the stars the chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendar computations and calculations according to needham , the earliest development of the armillary sphere in china goes back to the astronomers shi shen and gan de in the 4th century bc , as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument christopher cullen , '' joseph needham on chinese astronomy '' , past and present , no in 52 bc , it was the astronomer geng shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere with the famous statesman , astronomer , and inventor zhang heng ( 張衡 , 78–139 ad ) , the sphere was totally complete in 125 ad , with horizon and meridian rings the world 's first water-powered celestial globe was created by zhang heng , who operated his armillary sphere by use of an inflow clepsydra clock ( see zhang 's article for more detail ) subsequent developments were made after the han dynasty that improved the use of the armillary sphere in 323 ad the chinese astronomer kong ting was able to reorganize the arrangement of rings on the armillary sphere so that the ecliptic ring could be pegged on to the equator at any point desired the chinese astronomer and mathematician li chunfeng ( 李淳風 ) of the tang dynasty created one in 633 ad with three spherical layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observations , calling them 'nests ' ( chhung ) sivin , iii , 17 when jamal al-din of bukhara was asked to set up an 'islamic astronomical institution ' in khubilai khan 's new capital during the yuan dynasty , he commissioned a number of astronomical instruments , including an armillary sphere 120 bc ) credited eratosthenes ( 276194 bc ) as the inventor of the armillary sphere before the advent of the european telescope in the 17th century , the armillary sphere was the prime instrument of all astronomers in determining celestial positions in its simplest form , consisting of a ring fixed in the plane of the equator , the armilla is one of the most ancient of astronomical instruments such mechanisms are similar to ch'oe yu-ji ( 崔攸之 , 1603~1673 ) 's armillary sphere ( 1657 ) with the earth as center such a sphere is known as ptolemaic ; with the sun as center , as copernican the armillary sphere is commonly used in heraldry and vexillology , being mainly known as a symbol associated with portugal , the portuguese empire and the portuguese discoveries as a national symbol , the armillary sphere continued in use after the death of manuel i

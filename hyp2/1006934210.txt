the technikum was conceived in the early 1900s by the german-jewish fund ezrah as a school of engineering and sciences in october 1913 , the board of trustees selected german as the language of instruction , provoking a major controversy known as the war of the languages after opposition from american and russian jews to the use of german , the board of trustees reversed itself in february 1914 and selected hebrew as the language of instruction the german name technikum was also replaced by the hebrew name technion in 1923 albert einstein visited and planted the now-famous first arecaceae , as an initiative of nobel tradition the first palm tree still stands today in front of the old technion building , which is now the madatech museum , in the hadar neighborhood einstein founded the first technion society , and served as its president upon his return to germany technion city generally refers to the 1.2-square-kilometer site located on the pine-covered north-eastern slopes of mount carmel its original building in midtown haifa , in use by the technion until the mid-1980s , now houses the israel national museum of science , technology and space the rappaport faculty of medicine is located in the neighborhood of bat galim , adjacent to rambam hospital , the largest medical center in northern israel technion 's division of continuing education and external studies has been operating in the tel aviv area since 1958 in july 2013 , the technion moved to a new campus in sarona the technion satellite campus in sarona includes three buildings in a 1,800 sq on 19 december 2011 , a bid by a consortium of cornell university and technion won a competition to establish a new high-tier applied science and engineering institution in new york city the new 'school of genius ' in new york city has been named the jacobs technion-cornell institute its founding director was craig gotsman , technion 's hewlett-packard professor of computer engineering the li ka shing foundation pledged a grant of us 130 million for the creation of the institute the degrees taught , including bachelors , masters and doctorates , will be accredited by the technion gtiit will comprise three units : the college of engineering ; the college of science ; and the college of life science the institute will eventually grant technion engineering degrees at all levels - bachelor , masters and phd initially the courses offered are chemical engineering , biotechnology and food engineering , materials engineering the faculty has around 350 undergraduate students and over 100 graduate students ( 23 august 2012 ) israeli research may help severely paralyzed speak jpost israel news unique in israel , the faculty of biotechnology and food engineering offers a blend of courses in engineering , life and natural sciences as well as joint degree programs with the faculties of biology and chemistry civil and environmental engineering in 2002 , two of the original technion faculties – civil and agricultural engineering , were merged to create the faculty of civil and environmental engineering its state vision is to '' maintain and enhance the leading position of the faculty of civil & environmental engineering amongst the top departments in the world '' technion faculty of civil and environmental engineering דף בית the faculty is the home of technion 's expanding international school of engineering the wolfson faculty of chemical engineering is israel 's oldest and largest faculty in the field , educating the vast majority of chemical engineers in israel 's chemical industries the schulich faculty of chemistry offers a variety of joint programs , including with materials engineering , chemical engineering , physics , and food engineering it also offers a joint degree with the faculty of biology leading to a degree in molecular biochemistry founded in 1969 , this is one of the largest technion faculties , with over 1,000 undergraduate students and 200 graduate students the faculty of computer science was ranked 15th among 500 universities in computer sciences for 2011 and 18th of 500 since 2012 the faculty is home to a research and development center in the field it has over 100 graduate students and 350 undergraduate students including second career engineers and scientists who elect to study toward stem educator career some 2000 undergraduate students study in the department for a bsc degree in electrical engineering / computer engineering / computer and software engineering , and 400 graduate students study for the degrees of msc and phd the department has extensive relations with industry as well as academic and industrial special liaison support programs the ruth and bruce rappaport faculty of medicine is home to two nobel laureates : avram hershko and aaron ciechanover other facilities on the faculty of medicine campus include teaching laboratories , a medical library , lecture halls , and seminar rooms the faculty of physics engages in experimental and theoretical research in the fields of astrophysics , high energy physics , solid state physics and biophysics the technion library system is made of the elyachar central library and research libraries that are located in the faculty buildings technion live – division of public affairs & resource development at technion – israel institute of technology

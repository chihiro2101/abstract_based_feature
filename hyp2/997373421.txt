case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 retrieve : given a target problem , retrieve from memory cases relevant to solving it the procedure he followed for making the plain pancakes , together with justifications for decisions made along the way , constitutes fred 's retrieved case revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise at first glance , cbr may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms rule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem if for instance a procedure for plain pancakes is mapped to blueberry pancakes , a decision is made to use the same basic batter and frying method , thus implicitly generalizing the set of situations under which the batter and frying method can be used for instance , if a rule-induction algorithm were given recipes for plain pancakes , dutch apple pancakes , and banana pancakes as its training examples , it would have to derive , at training time , a set of general rules for making all types of pancakes in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation there is recent work that develops cbr within a statistical framework and formalizes case-based inference as a specific type of probabilistic inference ; thus , it becomes possible to produce case-based predictions equipped with a certain level of confidence one description of the difference between cbr and induction from instances is that statistical inference aims to find what tends to make cases similar while cbr aims to encode what suffices to claim similarly cbr technology has resulted in the deployment of a number of successful systems , the earliest being lockheed 's clavier , bill mark , '' case-based reasoning for autoclave management , '' proceedings of the case-based reasoning workshop ( 1989 ) case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the second international conference on case-based reasoning applying case-based reasoning : techniques for enterprise systems

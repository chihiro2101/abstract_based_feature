case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 retrieve : given a target problem , retrieve from memory cases relevant to solving it the procedure he followed for making the plain pancakes , together with justifications for decisions made along the way , constitutes fred 's retrieved case revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise fred , accordingly , records his new-found procedure for making blueberry pancakes , thereby enriching his set of stored experiences , and better preparing him for future pancake-making demands at first glance , cbr may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms rule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem a rule-induction algorithm draws its generalizations from a set of training examples before the target problem is even known ; that is , it performs eager generalization in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation however , all inductive reasoning where data is too scarce for statistical relevance is inherently based on anecdotal evidence '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches '' artificial intelligence communications 7 , no case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the third international conference on case-based reasoning case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the second international conference on case-based reasoning applying case-based reasoning : techniques for enterprise systems

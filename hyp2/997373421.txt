case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 a case consists of a problem , its solution , and , typically , annotations about how the solution was derived the procedure he followed for making the plain pancakes , together with justifications for decisions made along the way , constitutes fred 's retrieved case in the pancake example , fred must adapt his retrieved solution to include the addition of blueberries revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise suppose fred adapted his pancake solution by adding blueberries to the batter this suggests the following revision : delay the addition of blueberries until after the batter has been ladled into the pan retain : after the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem , store the resulting experience as a new case in memory at first glance , cbr may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms rule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation however , all inductive reasoning where data is too scarce for statistical relevance is inherently based on anecdotal evidence other schools of cbr and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s , which directed at topics such as legal reasoning , memory-based reasoning ( a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines ) , and combinations of cbr with other reasoning methods in the 1990s , interest in cbr grew internationally , as evidenced by the establishment of an international conference on case-based reasoning in 1995 , as well as european , german , british , italian , and other cbr workshops case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the third international conference on case-based reasoning case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the first international conference on case-based reasoning

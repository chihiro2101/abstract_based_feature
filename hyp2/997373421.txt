case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 retrieve : given a target problem , retrieve from memory cases relevant to solving it a case consists of a problem , its solution , and , typically , annotations about how the solution was derived the procedure he followed for making the plain pancakes , together with justifications for decisions made along the way , constitutes fred 's retrieved case in the pancake example , fred must adapt his retrieved solution to include the addition of blueberries revise : having mapped the previous solution to the target situation , test the new solution in the real world ( or a simulation ) and , if necessary , revise retain : after the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem , store the resulting experience as a new case in memory like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem this is in contrast to cbr , which delays ( implicit ) generalization of its cases until testing time â€“ a strategy of lazy generalization in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation in the 1990s , interest in cbr grew internationally , as evidenced by the establishment of an international conference on case-based reasoning in 1995 , as well as european , german , british , italian , and other cbr workshops case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the third international conference on case-based reasoning case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the second international conference on case-based reasoning case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the first international conference on case-based reasoning

case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process : agnar aamodt and enric plaza , '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches , '' artificial intelligence communications 7 ( 1994 ) : 1 , 39-52 suppose fred adapted his pancake solution by adding blueberries to the batter fred , accordingly , records his new-found procedure for making blueberry pancakes , thereby enriching his set of stored experiences , and better preparing him for future pancake-making demands at first glance , cbr may seem similar to the rule induction algorithms rule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept like a rule-induction algorithm , cbr starts with a set of cases or training examples ; it forms generalizations of these examples , albeit implicit ones , by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem if for instance a procedure for plain pancakes is mapped to blueberry pancakes , a decision is made to use the same basic batter and frying method , thus implicitly generalizing the set of situations under which the batter and frying method can be used the key difference , however , between the implicit generalization in cbr and the generalization in rule induction lies in when the generalization is made a rule-induction algorithm draws its generalizations from a set of training examples before the target problem is even known ; that is , it performs eager generalization in the pancake example , cbr has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes ; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation in law , there is often explicit delegation of cbr to courts , recognizing the limits of rule based reasons : limiting delay , limited knowledge of future context , limit of negotiated agreement , etc while cbr in law and cognitively inspired cbr have long been associated , the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning , and judgment , while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation other schools of cbr and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s , which directed at topics such as legal reasoning , memory-based reasoning ( a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines ) , and combinations of cbr with other reasoning methods '' case-based reasoning : foundational issues , methodological variations , and system approaches '' artificial intelligence communications 7 , no case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the second international conference on case-based reasoning case-based reasoning research and development : proceedings of the first international conference on case-based reasoning

development of welsh culture wales has been identified as having been inhabited by humans for some 230,000 years , as evidenced by the discovery of a neanderthal at the bontnewydd palaeolithic site in north wales these early kingdoms were also influenced by ireland ; but details prior to the 8th century ad are unclear while rhodri the great in the 9th century was the first ruler to dominate a large portion of wales , it was not until 1055 that gruffydd ap llywelyn united the individual welsh kingdoms and began to annex parts of england by 1070 , the normans had already seen successes in their invasion of wales , with gwent fallen and deheubarth plundered however , the welsh rebelled against their new overlords the following year , and the welsh kingdoms were re-established and most of the land retaken from the normans over the following decades while gwynedd grew in strength , powys was broken up after the death of llywelyn ap madog in the 1160s and was never reunited llywelyn the great rose in gwynedd and had reunited the majority of wales by his death in 1240 after his death , king henry iii of england intervened to prevent dafydd ap llywelyn from inheriting his father 's lands outside gwynedd , leading to war the claims of his successor , llywelyn ap gruffudd , conflicted with those of king edward i of england ; this resulted in the conquest of wales by english forces welsh nationalism emphasises the distinctiveness of welsh language , culture , and history , and calls for more self-determination for wales , which might include more devolved powers for the welsh assembly or full independence from the united kingdom while a sense of nationhood has existed within wales for over 1500 years , the idea that wales should be a modern self-determining state has only been mooted since the mid-18th century during the 15th century , owain glyndwr campaigned with initial success for wales to be reestablished as a country independent of english control national symbols of wales include the dragon , the daffodil and the leek though this same story is recounted in the 17th century , but now attributed to saint david it may also have been a reference to the 6th century welsh word draig , which meant '' leader '' following an increase in nationalism in 1953 , it was proposed to add the motto y ddraig goch ddyry cychwyn ( '' the red dragon takes the lead '' ) to the flag it has been proposed that the flag of the united kingdom be redesigned to include a symbol representing wales , as it is the only nation in the united kingdom not represented in the flag it may have been linked to the leek ; the welsh for daffodil ( cenhinen bedr ) translates as '' st peter 's leek '' during the 20th century , the daffodil rose to rival the prominence of the leek as a symbol of wales the traditional welsh costume and welsh hat were well known during the 19th and early 20th centuries throughout the centuries , the welsh language has been a central factor in the concept of wales as a nation before the roman occupation , the dominant religion in wales was a pagan one , led by the druids in the 6th century , this was home to dubricius , the first celtic saint the largest religion in modern wales is christianity , with almost 58 % of the population describing themselves as christian in the 2011 census the presbyterian church of wales was for many years the largest denomination ;

development of welsh culture wales has been identified as having been inhabited by humans for some 230,000 years , as evidenced by the discovery of a neanderthal at the bontnewydd palaeolithic site in north wales these early kingdoms were also influenced by ireland ; but details prior to the 8th century ad are unclear while rhodri the great in the 9th century was the first ruler to dominate a large portion of wales , it was not until 1055 that gruffydd ap llywelyn united the individual welsh kingdoms and began to annex parts of england by 1070 , the normans had already seen successes in their invasion of wales , with gwent fallen and deheubarth plundered however , the welsh rebelled against their new overlords the following year , and the welsh kingdoms were re-established and most of the land retaken from the normans over the following decades llywelyn the great rose in gwynedd and had reunited the majority of wales by his death in 1240 the claims of his successor , llywelyn ap gruffudd , conflicted with those of king edward i of england ; this resulted in the conquest of wales by english forces the tudors of penmynydd grew in power and influence during the 13th to 15th centuries , first owning land in north wales , but losing it after maredudd ap tudur backed the uprising of owain glyndŵr in 1400 welsh nationalism emphasises the distinctiveness of welsh language , culture , and history , and calls for more self-determination for wales , which might include more devolved powers for the welsh assembly or full independence from the united kingdom during the 15th century , owain glyndwr campaigned with initial success for wales to be reestablished as a country independent of english control national symbols of wales include the dragon , the daffodil and the leek legend states that the leek dates back to the 7th century , when king cadwaladr of gwynedd had his soldiers wear the vegetable during battle against saxons to make it easier to identify them though this same story is recounted in the 17th century , but now attributed to saint david the earliest certain reference of the leek as a welsh emblem was when princess mary , daughter of henry viii , was presented with a leek by the yeoman of the guard on saint david 's day in 1537 the standard was appropriated by the normans during the 11th century , and used for the royal standard of scotland both symbols were popular with tudor kings , with henry vii of england ( henry tudor ) adding the white and green background to the red dragon standard by the 17th and 18th centuries , it became common practice in great britain for the gentry to wear leeks on st following an increase in nationalism in 1953 , it was proposed to add the motto y ddraig goch ddyry cychwyn ( '' the red dragon takes the lead '' ) to the flag it has been proposed that the flag of the united kingdom be redesigned to include a symbol representing wales , as it is the only nation in the united kingdom not represented in the flag the daffodil is a more recent development , becoming popular during the 19th century it may have been linked to the leek ; the welsh for daffodil ( cenhinen bedr ) translates as '' st peter 's leek '' during the 20th century , the daffodil rose to rival the prominence of the leek as a symbol of wales the traditional welsh costume and welsh hat were well known during the 19th and early 20th centuries throughout the centuries , the welsh language has been a central factor in the concept of wales as a nation undoubtedly the strongest of the celtic languages , figures released by the office of national statistics taken from the 2011 census , show that welsh is spoken by 19 % of the population little is known about the traditions and ceremonies , but tacitus , whose claims were sometimes exaggerated , stated that they performed human sacrifice : he says that in ad 61 , an altar on anglesey was found to be '' drenched with the blood of their prisoners '' christianity was introduced to wales through the romans , and after they abandoned the british isles , it survived in south east wales at hentland in the 6th century , this was home to dubricius , the first celtic saint it forms part of the anglican communion , and was also part of the church of england , but was disestablished by the british government in 1920 under the welsh church act 1914 non-christian religions have relatively few followers in wales , with muslims making up 1.5 % of the population while hindus and buddhism represent 0.3 % each in the 2011 census david 's day is celebrated on 1 march , which some people argue should be designated a public holiday in wales other days which have been proposed for national public commemorations are 16 september ( the day on which owain glyndŵr 's rebellion began ) and 11 december ( the death of llywelyn ap gruffudd ) the 11th century ricemarch psalter ( now in dublin ) is certainly welsh , made in st david 's , and shows a late insular style with unusual viking influence but the wider view at the time was that the wider welsh music scene was stagnant , as the more popular musicians from wales were from earlier eras wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the fifa world cup , the rugby world cup and the commonwealth games in european football competitions , only teams playing in the welsh leagues are eligible to play for wales the mutton of wales has been popular in the rest of the united kingdom since the 16th century , and by the end of the 20th century there were more than 11 million sheep in wales 13 beer is the beer in wales of wales , despite the influence of the temperance movement in wales

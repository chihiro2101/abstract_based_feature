during the roman period , what is now the strand – running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become covent garden – was part of the route to silchester , known as '' iter vii '' on the antonine itinerary the area to the north of the strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century , but theories by alan vince and martin biddle that there had been an anglo-saxon settlement to the west of the old roman town of londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005 these revealed that a trading town , called lundenwic , developed around 600 & nbsp ; ad , stretching from trafalgar square to aldwych , with covent garden at the centre by the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard , meadow , pasture and arable land , lying between modern-day st martin 's lane and drury lane , and floral street and maiden lane the use of the name '' covent '' —an anglo-french term for a religious community , equivalent to '' monastery '' or '' convent '' ; also see —appears in a document in 1515 , when the abbey , which had been letting out parcels of land along the north side of the strand for inns and market gardens , granted a lease of the walled garden , referring to it as '' a garden called covent garden '' russell built bedford house and garden on part of the land , with an entrance on the strand , the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden in 1630 francis russell , 4th earl of bedford commissioned the architect inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza this had been prompted by king charles i having taken offence at the poor condition of the road and houses along long acre , which were the responsibility of russell and henry carey , 2nd earl of monmouth the houses initially attracted the wealthy , though they moved out when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654 , and coffee houses , taverns , and prostitutes moved in the covent garden estate was part of beecham 's pills from 1924 to 1928 , after which it was managed by a successor company called covent garden properties , owned by the beechams and other private investors this new company sold some properties at covent garden , while becoming active in property investment in other parts of london in 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the covent garden area , including the market , were sold to the newly established government-owned covent garden authority for £3,925,000 by the end of the 1960s , traffic congestion had reached such a level that the use of the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable , and significant redevelopment was planned the following year the market moved to a new site in nine elms , between battersea and vauxhall in south-west london the square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 the market buildings , along with several other properties in covent garden , were bought by a property company in 2006 historically , the bedford estate defined the boundary of covent garden , with drury lane to the east , the strand to the south , st martin 's lane to the west , and long acre to the north for a list of street name etymologies in covent garden see : street names of covent garden during a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to st martin in the fields , and then in 1645 a new parish was created , splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of st paul covent garden and st martin , both still within the liberty of westminster st paul covent garden was completely surrounded by the parish of st martin in the fields the northern reaches of covent garden were within the ancient parish of st giles in the fields and outside the liberty of westminster since 1965 covent garden falls within the london boroughs of westminster and camden , and is in the parliamentary constituencies of cities of london and westminster and holborn and st pancras london transport museum and the side entrance to the royal opera house box office and other facilities are also located on the square the market halls and several other buildings in covent garden were bought by capco in partnership with ge real estate in august 2006 for £421 & nbsp ; million , on a 150-year head lease the complete covent garden estate owned by capco consists of , and has a market value of £650 & nbsp ; million the central square in covent garden is simply called '' covent garden '' , often marketed as '' covent garden piazza '' to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area the square was originally laid out when the 4th earl of bedford , francis russell , commissioned inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to westminster abbey the centrepiece of the project was the large square , the concept of which was new to london , and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew , acting as the prototype for the design of new estates , such as the ladbroke estate and the grosvenor estate these arcades , rather than the square itself , took the name piazza ; the group from james street to russell street became known as the '' great piazza '' and that to the south of russell street as the '' little piazza '' further buildings were added—the floral hall , charter market , and in 1904 the jubilee market for foreign flowers was built by cubitt and howard by the end of the 1960s , traffic congestion was causing problems for the market , which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution another market , the jubilee market , is held in the jubilee hall on the south side of the square the market halls and several other buildings in covent garden have been owned by the property company capital & counties properties ( capco ) since 2006 the covent garden area has over 60 pubs and bars ; several of them are listed buildings , with some also on camra 's national inventory of historic pub interiors ; some , such as the harp in chandos place , have received consumer awards covent garden , and especially the market , have appeared in a number of works covent garden community association covent garden london

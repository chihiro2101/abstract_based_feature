during the roman period , what is now the strand – running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become covent garden – was part of the route to silchester , known as '' iter vii '' on the antonine itinerary the area to the north of the strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century , but theories by alan vince and martin biddle that there had been an anglo-saxon settlement to the west of the old roman town of londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005 these revealed that a trading town , called lundenwic , developed around 600 & nbsp ; ad , stretching from trafalgar square to aldwych , with covent garden at the centre the first mention of a walled garden comes from a document , circa 1200 & nbsp ; ad , detailing land owned by the benedictines of the westminster abbey by the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard , meadow , pasture and arable land , lying between modern-day st martin 's lane and drury lane , and floral street and maiden lane in 1552 king edward vi granted it to john russell , 1st earl of bedford , his late father 's trusted adviser russell built bedford house and garden on part of the land , with an entrance on the strand , the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden in 1630 francis russell , 4th earl of bedford commissioned the architect inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza this had been prompted by king charles i having taken offence at the poor condition of the road and houses along long acre , which were the responsibility of russell and henry carey , 2nd earl of monmouth in 1830 a market hall was built to provide a more permanent trading centre the covent garden estate was part of beecham 's pills from 1924 to 1928 , after which it was managed by a successor company called covent garden properties , owned by the beechams and other private investors in 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the covent garden area , including the market , were sold to the newly established government-owned covent garden authority for £3,925,000 the square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 the market buildings , along with several other properties in covent garden , were bought by a property company in 2006 historically , the bedford estate defined the boundary of covent garden , with drury lane to the east , the strand to the south , st martin 's lane to the west , and long acre to the north long acre is the main thoroughfare , running north-east from st martin 's lane to drury lane for a list of street name etymologies in covent garden see : street names of covent garden the covent garden estate was originally under the control of westminster abbey and lay in the parish of st margaret since 1965 covent garden falls within the london boroughs of westminster and camden , and is in the parliamentary constituencies of cities of london and westminster and holborn and st pancras covent garden market reopened in 1980 as a shopping arcade with restaurants and a pub long acre has clothes shops and boutiques , and neal street is noted for its numerous shoe shops the market halls and several other buildings in covent garden were bought by capco in partnership with ge real estate in august 2006 for £421 & nbsp ;

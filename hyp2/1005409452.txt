during the roman period , what is now the strand – running along the southern boundary of the area that was to become covent garden – was part of the route to silchester , known as '' iter vii '' on the antonine itinerary the area to the north of the strand was long thought to have remained as unsettled fields until the 16th century , but theories by alan vince and martin biddle that there had been an anglo-saxon settlement to the west of the old roman town of londinium were borne out by excavations in 1985 and 2005 these revealed that a trading town , called lundenwic , developed around 600 & nbsp ; ad , stretching from trafalgar square to aldwych , with covent garden at the centre the first mention of a walled garden comes from a document , circa 1200 & nbsp ; ad , detailing land owned by the benedictines of the westminster abbey by the 13th century this had become a quadrangle of mixed orchard , meadow , pasture and arable land , lying between modern-day st martin 's lane and drury lane , and floral street and maiden lane russell built bedford house and garden on part of the land , with an entrance on the strand , the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden in 1630 francis russell , 4th earl of bedford commissioned the architect inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza the houses initially attracted the wealthy , though they moved out when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654 , and coffee houses , taverns , and prostitutes moved in by the 18th century , covent garden had become a well-known red-light district , attracting notable prostitutes such as betty careless and jane douglas in 1913 herbrand russell , 11th duke of bedford agreed to sell the covent garden estate for £2 & nbsp ; million to the mp and land speculator harry mallaby-deeley , who sold his option in 1918 to the beecham family for £250,000 the covent garden estate was part of beecham 's pills from 1924 to 1928 , after which it was managed by a successor company called covent garden properties , owned by the beechams and other private investors this new company sold some properties at covent garden , while becoming active in property investment in other parts of london in 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the covent garden area , including the market , were sold to the newly established government-owned covent garden authority for £3,925,000 the market buildings , along with several other properties in covent garden , were bought by a property company in 2006 historically , the bedford estate defined the boundary of covent garden , with drury lane to the east , the strand to the south , st martin 's lane to the west , and long acre to the north however , over time the area regarded as part of covent garden has expanded northwards past long acre to high holborn since 1971 , with the creation of the covent garden conservation area which incorporated part of the area between st martin 's lane and charing cross road , charing cross road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary for a list of street name etymologies in covent garden see : street names of covent garden the covent garden estate was originally under the control of westminster abbey and lay in the parish of st margaret the northern reaches of covent garden were within the ancient parish of st giles in the fields and outside the liberty of westminster covent garden came within the area of responsibility of the metropolitan board of works from 1855 and in 1889 became part of the county of london since 1965 covent garden falls within the london boroughs of westminster and camden , and is in the parliamentary constituencies of cities of london and westminster and holborn and st pancras long acre has clothes shops and boutiques , and neal street is noted for its numerous shoe shops the inclusion of the adjacent old floral hall , previously a part of the old covent garden market , created a large new public gathering place the central square in covent garden is simply called '' covent garden '' , often marketed as '' covent garden piazza '' to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area designed and laid out in 1630 , it was the first modern square in london—originally a flat , open space or piazza with low railings a casual market started on the south side , and by 1830 the present market hall had been built the square was originally laid out when the 4th earl of bedford , francis russell , commissioned inigo jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to westminster abbey the centrepiece of the project was the large square , the concept of which was new to london , and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew , acting as the prototype for the design of new estates , such as the ladbroke estate and the grosvenor estate the church of st paul 's was the first building , and was begun in july 1631 on the western side of the square these arcades , rather than the square itself , took the name piazza ;

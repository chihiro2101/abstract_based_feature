combined austro-russian army in italy 53 on 27 april suvorov defeated the french , now under jean victor marie moreau , at the battle of cassano the next day a 3,000-man french division was trapped and surrendered at verderio superiore 152-153 the next major action was the battle of trebbia from 17 to 20 june where suvorov 's 37,000-strong austro-russian army mauled jacques macdonald 's 33,000-man french army the allies suffered 5,500 casualties while inflicting 16,500 on the french including the taking of 7,000 prisoners 43 a day after defeating macdonald at the trebbia , the allies captured the 17th light demi brigade , 1,099 men , six guns and three colors on 22 june suvorov halted pursuit by his army , exhausted by continuous marching and fighting at first a division was allowed to follow the french , duffy ( 1999 ) , p 112 but this was soon reduced to an austrian advanced guard under johann von klenau which went on to clear the grand duchy of tuscany of enemy forces on 20 june , moreau and 14,000 french troops left the security of the mountains to defeat count heinrich von bellegarde and 11,000 austrians in the second battle of marengo 160 by 27 june , suvorov moved his main army west to cover the sieges of alessandria and tortona while kray was still reducing mantua suvorov and his austrian chief of staff johann gabriel chasteler de courcelles planned to evict the weakened and battered french forces from genoa and the italian riviera emperor francis and his foreign minister johann amadeus francis de paula , baron of thugut insisted that the italian fortresses must first be captured in fact the emperor and thugut were suspicious of russian designs on genoa and tuscany , areas which they considered to be in austria 's sphere of influence there were two major forces in italy , the 19,000-strong army of the alps under jean étienne championnet and 40,713 men of the army of italy the french government placed its hopes on barthélemy catherine joubert to retrieve the situation as the new commander of the army of italy these important events released 30,000 coalition troops for field operations suvarov placed konrad valentin von kaim with 14,000 austrians to guard the west of piedmont and karl joseph hadik von futak with 11,000 more to observe the alpine passes into switzerland to the north 129 in the meantime , chasteler was seriously wounded by a canister shot on 17 july during the siege of alessandria duffy ( 1999 ) , p the army of italy was fortunate in having capable generals joubert 's generals wished to wait for championnet 's army to come up on their left around 20 august before advancing however , joubert believed that his orders to attack from the directory were imperative and refused to delay 132 saint-cyr 's wing moved north through the bocchetta pass and gavi this position had been captured by pyotr bagration 's 2,100-man russian advance guard as recently as 9 august this french column pushed some of bellegarde 's troops out of terzo then swung east through acqui terme , rivalta bormida and capriata d'orba saint-cyr arrived alone at novi ligure on 13 august , but suvorov declined to attack , hoping to lure the french into the plains where his superior cavalry and artillery might prove decisive 133 kray 's troops reached alessandria on 12 june and suvorov planned to launch them into an attack on pérignon 's wing early on the 14th this proved to be impossible , but kray managed to join bellegarde 's force and he promised to attack on 15 august meanwhile , the division of françois watrin moved down from the hills in the direction of tortona , giving every indication that the french offensive was still in full swing but he was stunned to see that he was facing at least 36,000 enemies including kray 's corps in the plains below meanwhile , suvorov assumed that the french army would soon descend into the plains once the turning movements were well developed , wilhelm derfelden 's 9,850 russians and melas ' 8,800 austrians would join the battle kray 's corps was divided into two austrian divisions under bellegarde and peter karl ott von bátorkéz bellegarde 's division consisted of three battalions each of the sztáray nr 39 infantry regiments , two battalions each of the huff nr this force numbered 11,796 foot and 1,724 horse or a strength of 13,520 troops to bellegarde 's right was a screening force under seckendorff which was made up of two battalions of the oranien nr 15 infantry regiment , one battalion of the szluiner grenz and three squadrons of the hussar regiment nr kray wielded a total of 27,420 troops in his large corps on the allied left , melas commanded michael von fröhlich 's 8,575-strong austrian division the division consisted of more than 3,660 grenadiers in nine battalions , six squadrons each of the lobkowitz nr 14 dragoon regiments , 1,258 sabers , three battalions of the fürstenberg infantry regiment nr dombrowski 's division counted between 2,130 and 2,340 troops in seven battalions dombrowski 's units were the 17th and 55th line , the polish legion including a cavalry squadron and two battalions of the 1st ( italian ) cisalpine bagration 's troops were able to press back the french skirmish lines but were foiled when they encountered novi 's city wall but at about this time the french army split into two halves which were not reunited until three days later if a french soldier survived as a prisoner , it was because he was taken by kray 's austrians duffy gave french losses as 6,500 to 6,643 ; evidently this is only the killed and wounded this army would be formed by joining the russian troops in italy to another russian army in germany under alexander korsakov

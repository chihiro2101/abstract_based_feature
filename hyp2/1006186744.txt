in several english-speaking states , the terms county town and county seat are also used in lower subdivisions the capital is often the largest city of its constituent , though not always historically , the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power , and became a capital through conquest or federation ( the modern capital city has , however , not always existed : in medieval western europe , an itinerant court was common ) examples are babylon , baghdad history , ancient athens , rome , constantinople , chang'an , cusco , madrid , paris , london , moscow , beijing , tokyo , vienna , lisbon , and berlin the capital city naturally attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments , such as lawyers , political scientists , bankers , journalists , and public policy ( law ) s although many capitals are defined by constitution or legislation , many long-time capitals have no legal designation as such , including bern , edinburgh , lisbon , london , paris , and wellington they are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention , and because all or almost all the country 's central political institutions , such as government departments , supreme court , legislature , embassies , etc counties in the united kingdom have historic county towns , which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centers , as many historical counties are now only ceremonial , and administrative boundaries are different the states of such countries as mexico , brazil ( including the famous cities of rio de janeiro and são paulo , capitals of their respective states ) , and australia also each have capital cities in australia , the term '' capital cities '' is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital canberra , and darwin , the capital of the northern territory in unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations , such as the united kingdom and the kingdom of denmark , each will usually have its own capital city unlike in federations , there is usually not a separate national capital , but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall , such as london , which is the capital of england and of the united kingdom similarly , each of the autonomous communities of spain and regions of italy has a capital city , such as seville and naples , while madrid is the capital of the community of madrid and of the kingdom of spain as a whole and rome is the capital of italy and of the region of lazio in the germany , each of its constituent states ( or länder , plural of land ) has its own capital city , such as dresden , wiesbaden , mainz , düsseldorf , stuttgart , and munich , as do all of the republics of the russian federation many national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries , but in many countries this is not the case , us ( 1800 ) these cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria : a deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government , superseding a capital city that was in an established population center there have been various reasons for this , including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area , and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate ( usually a less tropical one ) usually , the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres , united states , founded as a compromise between more urbanized northern states and agrarian southern '' slave states '' to share national power a few nation-states have multiple capitals , and there are also several states that have no capital some have a city as the capital but with most government agencies elsewhere belize : belmopan was designated the national capital in 1971 , but most government offices and embassies are still located in belize city canary islands ( spain ) : until 1927 the capital of the province of canarias was santa cruz de tenerife when the canary islands became an autonomous community in 1982 , santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria were both given capital status france : the french constitution does not recognize any capital city in france various german government agencies are located in other parts of germany the entire state machinery shifts from one city to another every six months myanmar ( burma ) : naypyidaw was designated the national capital in 2005 , the same year it was founded , but most government offices and embassies are still located in yangon ( rangoon ) ivory coast : yamoussoukro was designated the national capital in 1983 , but most government offices and embassies are still located in abidjan ) some historical examples of similar arrangements , where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government : kingdom of england : the traditional capital was the city of london , while westminster , outside of the boundaries of the city of london , was the seat of government for example : the ruined and almost uninhabited athens was made capital of newly independent greece in 1834 , four years after the country gained its independence , with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of ancient greece during the 1857 rebellion , india considered delhi their capital , and bahadur shah zafar was proclaimed emperor , but the ruling british had their capital in kolkata sometimes , the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities , such as in the cases of canberra , ottawa , washington , wellington and managua

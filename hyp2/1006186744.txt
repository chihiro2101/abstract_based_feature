in several english-speaking states , the terms county town and county seat are also used in lower subdivisions the capital is often the largest city of its constituent , though not always historically , the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power , and became a capital through conquest or federation ( the modern capital city has , however , not always existed : in medieval western europe , an itinerant court was common the capital city naturally attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments , such as lawyers , political scientists , bankers , journalists , and public policy ( law ) s the decline of a dynasty or culture could also mean the extinction of its capital city , as occurred at babylon and cahokia they are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention , and because all or almost all the country 's central political institutions , such as government departments , supreme court , legislature , embassies , etc in canada , there is a ottawa , while the ten provinces and three territories each have capital cities the states of such countries as mexico , brazil ( including the famous cities of rio de janeiro and são paulo , capitals of their respective states ) , and australia also each have capital cities in australia , the term '' capital cities '' is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital canberra , and darwin , the capital of the northern territory in unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations , such as the united kingdom and the kingdom of denmark , each will usually have its own capital city unlike in federations , there is usually not a separate national capital , but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall , such as london , which is the capital of england and of the united kingdom similarly , each of the autonomous communities of spain and regions of italy has a capital city , such as seville and naples , while madrid is the capital of the community of madrid and of the kingdom of spain as a whole and rome is the capital of italy and of the region of lazio in the germany , each of its constituent states ( or länder , plural of land ) has its own capital city , such as dresden , wiesbaden , mainz , düsseldorf , stuttgart , and munich , as do all of the republics of the russian federation each of the states of austria and cantons of switzerland also have their own capital cities vienna , the national capital of austria , is also one of the states , while bern is the ( de facto ) capital of both switzerland and of the canton of bern many national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries , but in many countries this is not the case , us ( 1800 ) these cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria : a deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government , superseding a capital city that was in an established population center there have been various reasons for this , including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area , and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate ( usually a less tropical one ) some have a city as the capital but with most government agencies elsewhere there is also a ghost town which is currently the de jure capital of a territory : plymouth in montserrat belize : belmopan was designated the national capital in 1971 , but most government offices and embassies are still located in belize city when the canary islands became an autonomous community in 1982 , santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria were both given

supreme court is headquartered in san francisco similarly , while victoria was the capital of colonial hong kong , the district of central serves as the seat of government offices today ) some historical examples of similar arrangements , where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government : kingdom of england : the traditional capital was the city of london , while westminster , outside of the boundaries of the city of london , was the seat of government delhi finally became the colonial capital after the delhi durbar of king-emperor george v in 1911 ,

the development of standards for digital audio interconnect for both professional and domestic audio equipment , began in the late 1970s in a joint effort between the audio engineering society and the european broadcasting union , and culminated in the publishing of aes3 in 1985 the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions early on , the standard was frequently known as aes/ebu these are essentially consumer versions of aes3 for use within the domestic high fidelity environment using connectors more commonly found in the consumer market these variants are commonly known as s/pdif the aes3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard iec 60958 of the physical interconnection types defined by iec 60958 , two are in common use type i connections are most often used in professional installations and are considered the standard connector for aes3 two subframes ( a and b , normally used for left and right audio channels ) make a frame frames contain 64 bit periods and are produced once per audio sample period while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) , other than at the start of an audio block the three preambles are called x , y , z in the aes3 standard ; and m , w , b in iec 958 ( an aes extension ) in the case of aes3 , the standard describes , in detail , the function of each bit generally set to 000 ( unused ) or 001 ( used for 24-bit audio data ) the aes52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an aes3 bit stream the standard for packing aes3 frames into atm cells is aes47

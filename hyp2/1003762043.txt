the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions early on , the standard was frequently known as aes/ebu the aes3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard iec 60958 two subframes ( a and b , normally used for left and right audio channels ) make a frame frames contain 64 bit periods and are produced once per audio sample period while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block the synchronisation preamble is a specially coded preamble that identifies the subframe and its position within the audio block preambles are not normal bmc-encoded data bits , although they do still have zero dc bias ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) at the start of an audio block the three preambles are called x , y , z in the aes3 standard ; and m , w , b in iec 958 ( an aes extension ) between the aes3 and s/pdif standards , the contents of the 192-bit channel status word differ significantly , although they agree that the first channel status bit distinguishes between the two byte 0 : basic control data : sample rate , compression , emphasis bit 0 : a value of 1 indicates this is aes3 channel status data bit 1 : a value of 0 indicates this is linear audio pcm data bit 5 : a value of 0 indicates that the source is locked to some ( unspecified ) external time sync bits 6â€“7 : sample rate the aes11 standard provides information on the synchronization of digital audio structures the aes52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an aes3 bit stream

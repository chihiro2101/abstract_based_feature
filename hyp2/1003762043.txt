the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions type i connections are most often used in professional installations and are considered the standard connector for aes3 frames contain 64 bit periods and are produced once per audio sample period while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block at 48 & nbsp ; khz sample rate , there are 250 audio blocks per second , and 3,072,000 time slots per second supported by a 6.144 & nbsp ; mhz biphase clock ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) , other than at the start of an audio block ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) at the start of an audio block the 8-bit preambles are transmitted in the time allocated to the first four time slots of each subframe ( time slots 0 to 3 ) there is one channel status bit in each subframe , a total of 192 bits or 24 bytes for each channel in each block byte 0 : basic control data : sample rate , compression , emphasis bit 0 : a value of 1 indicates this is aes3 channel status data bit 1 : a value of 0 indicates this is linear audio pcm data bit 5 : a value of 0 indicates that the source is locked to some ( unspecified ) external time sync bits 6–7 : sample rate options are unspecified , 48 & nbsp ; khz ( the default ) , 44.1 & nbsp ; khz , and 32 & nbsp ; khz generally set to 000 ( unused ) or 001 ( used for 24-bit audio data ) bit 6 : if set , bytes 14–17 ( sample address ) are unreliable the aes52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an aes3 bit stream

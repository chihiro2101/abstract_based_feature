the development of standards for digital audio interconnect for both professional and domestic audio equipment , began in the late 1970s in a joint effort between the audio engineering society and the european broadcasting union , and culminated in the publishing of aes3 in 1985 the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions the aes3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard iec 60958 type i connections are most often used in professional installations and are considered the standard connector for aes3 two subframes ( a and b , normally used for left and right audio channels ) make a frame at the highest level , each 192 consecutive frames are grouped into an audio block while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block the synchronisation preamble is a specially coded preamble that identifies the subframe and its position within the audio block ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) at the start of an audio block the three preambles are called x , y , z in the aes3 standard ; and m , w , b in iec 958 ( an aes extension ) x or z marks the beginning of a frame , and z marks the beginning of an audio block in the case of aes3 , the standard describes , in detail , the function of each bit these bits are redundant when real-time audio is transmitted ( the receiver can observe the sample rate directly ) , but are useful if aes3 data is recorded or otherwise stored byte 1 : indicates if the audio stream is stereo , mono or some other combination byte 22 : channel status word reliability indication bits 0–3 : reserved bit 4 : if set , bytes 0–5 ( signal format ) are unreliable the aes52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an aes3 bit stream the standard for packing aes3 frames into atm cells is aes47

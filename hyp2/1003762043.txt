the aes3 standard has been revised in 1992 and 2003 and is published in aes and ebu versions early on , the standard was frequently known as aes/ebu the aes3 standard parallels part 4 of the international standard iec 60958 of the physical interconnection types defined by iec 60958 , two are in common use type i connections are most often used in professional installations and are considered the standard connector for aes3 frames contain 64 bit periods and are produced once per audio sample period while samples repeat each frame time , metadata is only transmitted once per audio block ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) , other than at the start of an audio block ) marks a word for channel a ( left ) at the start of an audio block the three preambles are called x , y , z in the aes3 standard ; and m , w , b in iec 958 ( an aes extension ) in the case of aes3 , the standard describes , in detail , the function of each bit bit 1 : a value of 0 indicates this is linear audio pcm data bits 4–7 : used to indicate the format of the user channel word byte 2 : audio word length bits 0–2 : aux bits usage this indicates how the aux bits ( time slots 4–7 ) are used this indicates other sample rates , not representable in byte 0 bits 6–7 the aes52 standard describes how to insert unique identifiers into an aes3 bit stream the standard for packing aes3 frames into atm cells is aes47

dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) ajige and dodo were his full brothers , and hong taiji was one of his half-brothers dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 during hong taiji 's reign , dorgon participated in many military campaigns , including the conquests of mongolia and korea after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor since the shunzhi emperor was only six years old at that time , dorgon was appointed regent and became the de facto ruler in 1645 , dorgon was conferred the title '' emperor 's uncle and prince-regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) later , in 1649 , the title was changed to '' emperor 's father and prince-regent '' ( 皇父攝政王 ) it was rumoured that dorgon had a romantic affair with the shunzhi emperor 's mother , empress dowager xiaozhuang , and even secretly married her , but there are also refutations whether they secretly married , according to manchu custom , a widowed woman can marry her brother-in-law dorgon soon replaced hooge 's supporters ( mostly from the yellow banners ) with his own , thus gaining closer control of two more banners . in early 1644 , just as dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the ming empire , peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching beijing on 24 april of that year , rebel forces led by li zicheng breached the walls of the ming capital the last ming emperor , the chongzhen emperor , hanged himself at a hill behind the forbidden city the last obstacle between dorgon and beijing was wu sangui , a former ming general guarding the shanhai pass at the eastern end of the great wall he requested dorgon 's help in ousting the rebels and restoring the ming empire . they were startled when , instead of meeting wu sangui and the ming heir apparent , they saw dorgon , a horse-riding manchu with the front half of his head shaved , present himself as the prince regent yet , at the same time , as he claimed to have come to avenge the ming empire , dorgon ordered that all claimants to the ming throne ( including descendants of the last ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters . on june 7 , just two days after entering the city , dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital , assuring them that if the local population surrendered , the officials would be allowed to stay at their posts 420–22 ( which explains these matters and claims that the order was repealed by edict on 25 june ) a formal ritual of enthronement for the shunzhi emperor was held on 8 november , during which the young emperor compared dorgon 's achievements to those of the duke of zhou , a revered regent of the zhou dynasty during the ceremony , dorgon 's official title was raised from '' prince regent '' to '' uncle and prince regent '' ( 叔父攝政王 ) , in which the manchu term for '' uncle '' ( ecike ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince dorgon gave a manchu woman as a wife to the han chinese official feng quan , who had defected from the ming to the qing one of dorgon 's first orders in the new qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of beijing and give it to bannermen , including han chinese bannermen '' in 1646 , dorgon also ordered that the imperial examination for selecting government officials be reinstated . the 1649 examination asked '' how manchus and han chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division under the shunzhi emperor 's reign , the average number of graduates of the metropolitan examination per session was the highest of the qing dynasty ( '' to win more chinese support '' ) , continuing until 1660 when lower quotas were established after repressing anti-qing revolts in hebei and shandong in the summer and fall of 1644 , dorgon sent armies to root out li zicheng from the important city of xi'an ( shaanxi province ) , where li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing beijing in early june 1644 483 ( li reestablished headquarters in xi'an ) and 501 ( hebei and shandong revolts , new campaigns against li ) under the pressure of qing armies , li was forced to leave xi'an in february 1645 several qing armies swept south , taking the key city of xuzhou north of the huai river in early may 1645 and soon converging on yangzhou , the main city on the southern ming 's northern line of defence bravely defended by shi kefa , who refused to surrender , yangzhou fell to qing artillery on 20 may after a one-week siege . the qing forces soon captured the ming emperor ( who died in beijing the following year ) and seized jiangnan 's main cities , including suzhou and hangzhou ; by early july 1645 , the frontier between the qing empire and the southern ming regime had been pushed south to the qiantang river ( capture of suzhou and hangzhou by early july 1645 ; new frontier ) ; ( capture of the emperor around 17 june , and later death in beijing ) on 21 july 1645 , after jiangnan had been superficially pacified , dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all han chinese men to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues identical to those of the manchus . in may 1648 , however , li mutinied against the qing empire , and the concurrent rebellion of another former ming general in jiangxi helped the yongli emperor to retake most of south china as a result , shunzhi posthumously stripped dorgon of his titles and even had dorgon 's corpse exhumed and flogged in public in 1778 , the qianlong emperor granted dorgon a posthumous name zhong ( 忠 ; '' loyal '' ) , so dorgon 's full posthumous title became '' prince ruizhong of the first rank '' ( 和碩睿忠親王 ) this heir of dorgon ran all the way to modern-day zhongshan , guangdong province , the southern tip of china fronting the south china sea , where there was no more way to maximize the distance between his hiding place and the forbidden city

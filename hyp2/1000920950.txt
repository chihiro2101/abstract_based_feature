dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) ajige and dodo were his full brothers , and hong taiji was one of his half-brothers dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 during hong taiji 's reign , dorgon participated in many military campaigns , including the conquests of mongolia and korea after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor since the shunzhi emperor was only six years old at that time , dorgon was appointed regent and became the de facto ruler in 1645 , dorgon was conferred the title '' emperor 's uncle and prince-regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) it was rumoured that dorgon had a romantic affair with the shunzhi emperor 's mother , empress dowager xiaozhuang , and even secretly married her , but there are also refutations . after an alleged plot by hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 may of that year , hooge was stripped of his princely title and his co-conspirators were executed dorgon soon replaced hooge 's supporters ( mostly from the yellow banners ) with his own , thus gaining closer control of two more banners on 24 april of that year , rebel forces led by li zicheng breached the walls of the ming capital the last ming emperor , the chongzhen emperor , hanged himself at a hill behind the forbidden city . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire . wu sangui was caught between the manchus and li zicheng 's forces . aided by wu sangui 's elite soldiers , who fought the rebel army for hours before dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry , the qing army won a decisive victory against li zicheng at the battle of shanhai pass on 27 may ( were all expecting wu sangui and the heir apparent ) and 315 ( reaction to seeing dorgon instead ) . on june 7 , just two days after entering the city , dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital , assuring them that if the local population surrendered , the officials would be allowed to stay at their posts besides , all the men had to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues he had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around beijing , threatening qing control over the capital region . the southern cadet branch of confucius 's descendants who held the title wujing boshi and the northern branch 65th generation descendant of confucius to hold the title duke yansheng had their titles confirmed by the shunzhi emperor on 31 october a formal ritual of enthronement for the shunzhi emperor was held on 8 november , during which the young emperor compared dorgon 's achievements to those of the duke of zhou , a revered regent of the zhou dynasty during the ceremony , dorgon 's official title was raised from '' prince regent '' to '' uncle and prince regent '' ( 叔父攝政王 ) , in which the manchu term for '' uncle '' ( ecike ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince three days later dorgon 's co-regent , jirgalang , was demoted from '' prince regent '' to '' assistant uncle prince regent '' ( 輔政叔王 ) after repressing anti-qing revolts in hebei and shandong in the summer and fall of 1644 , dorgon sent armies to root out li zicheng from the important city of xi'an ( shaanxi province ) , where li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing beijing in early june 1644 . from newly captured xi'an , in early april 1645 , the qing forces mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of jiangnan south of the lower yangtze river , where in june 1644 prince of fu had established a regime loyal to the ming factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the southern ming from mounting an efficient resistance several qing armies swept south , taking the key city of xuzhou north of the huai river in early may 1645 and soon converging on yangzhou , the main city on the southern ming 's northern line of defence . the qing forces soon captured the ming emperor ( who died in beijing the following year ) and seized jiangnan 's main cities , including suzhou and hangzhou ; by early july 1645 , the frontier between the qing empire and the southern ming regime had been pushed south to the qiantang river ( capture of suzhou and hangzhou by early july 1645 ; new frontier ) ; ( capture of the emperor around 17 june , and later death in beijing ) bending forward to touch a cylindrical container from which smoke is rising , he is resting his left elbow on his folded left knee. left thumb a man in san francisco 's chinatown around 1900 the old chinese habit of wearing a queue came from dorgon 's july 1645 edict ordering all men to shave the front half of their head and wear the rest of their hair in a queue similar to those of the manchus ( '' from the manchus ' perspective , the command to cut one 's hair or lose one 's head not only brought rulers and subjects together into a single physical resemblance ; it also provided them with a perfect loyalty test '' ) because it united chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against qing rule , the hair cutting command greatly hindered the qing conquest another cause for suspicion is that dorgon 's corpse was exhumed , flogged , and incinerated in the purge ordered by emperor shunzhi , a likely method camouflaged as the ultimate punishment for his alleged plot to take over the throne , in order to remove all evidence that dorgon was murdered execution of all of dorgon 's heirs was also ordered but intentionally not recorded in official qing history dorgon had two biological brothers : ajige , the eighth son of nurhaci and dodo , the 15th in 1778 , the qianlong emperor granted dorgon a posthumous name zhong ( 忠 ; '' loyal '' ) , so dorgon 's full posthumous title became '' prince ruizhong of the first rank '' ( 和碩睿忠親王 ) the village where his descendants have sprang up since 1651 was named '' revelation of the dragon 顯龍 '' , indicating his hope that one day someone in his line would be able to reclaim the throne , which never happened through the remaining years of the qing dynasty prince rui ( 睿 ) royal and noble ranks of the qing dynasty male members ranks of imperial consorts in china qing qing conquest of the ming

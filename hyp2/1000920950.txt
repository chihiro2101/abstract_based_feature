dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 during hong taiji 's reign , dorgon participated in many military campaigns , including the conquests of mongolia and korea after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor since the shunzhi emperor was only six years old at that time , dorgon was appointed regent and became the de facto ruler in 1645 , dorgon was conferred the title '' emperor 's uncle and prince-regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) later , in 1649 , the title was changed to '' emperor 's father and prince-regent '' ( 皇父攝政王 ) it was rumoured that dorgon had a romantic affair with the shunzhi emperor 's mother , empress dowager xiaozhuang , and even secretly married her , but there are also refutations . after an alleged plot by hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 may of that year , hooge was stripped of his princely title and his co-conspirators were executed dorgon soon replaced hooge 's supporters ( mostly from the yellow banners ) with his own , thus gaining closer control of two more banners . in early 1644 , just as dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the ming empire , peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching beijing on 24 april of that year , rebel forces led by li zicheng breached the walls of the ming capital the last ming emperor , the chongzhen emperor , hanged himself at a hill behind the forbidden city . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire . when dorgon asked wu sangui to work for the qing empire instead , wu had little choice but to accept . aided by wu sangui 's elite soldiers , who fought the rebel army for hours before dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry , the qing army won a decisive victory against li zicheng at the battle of shanhai pass on 27 may after six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops , the residents of beijing sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 june ( were all expecting wu sangui and the heir apparent ) and 315 ( reaction to seeing dorgon instead ) in the midst of this upheaval , dorgon installed himself as prince-regent in wuying palace ( 武英殿 ) , the only building that remained more or less intact after li zicheng had set fire to the forbidden city on 3 june yet , at the same time , as he claimed to have come to avenge the ming empire , dorgon ordered that all claimants to the ming throne ( including descendants of the last ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters . on june 7 , just two days after entering the city , dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital , assuring them that if the local population surrendered , the officials would be allowed to stay at their posts besides , all the men had to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues dorgon greeted the shunzhi emperor at the gates of beijing on 19 october 1644 a formal ritual of enthronement for the shunzhi emperor was held on 8 november , during which the young emperor compared dorgon 's achievements to those of the duke of zhou , a revered regent of the zhou dynasty during the ceremony , dorgon 's official title was raised from '' prince regent '' to '' uncle and prince regent '' ( 叔父攝政王 ) , in which the manchu term for '' uncle '' ( ecike ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince three days later dorgon 's co-regent , jirgalang , was demoted from '' prince regent '' to '' assistant uncle prince regent '' ( 輔政叔王 ) . in june 1645 , dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as '' imperial uncle prince regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) , leaving him one step short of claiming the throne for himself dorgon gave a manchu woman as a wife to the han chinese official feng quan , who had defected from the ming to the qing this distribution complied with the order established in the manchu homeland before the conquest and under which '' each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass . agricultural land outside the capital was also delineated ( quan 圈 ) and given to qing troops . the 1649 examination asked '' how manchus and han chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division , table 1.1 ( number of graduates per session under each qing reign ) ; ( reason for the high quotas ) ; ( lower quotas in 1660 ) after repressing anti-qing revolts in hebei and shandong in the summer and fall of 1644 , dorgon sent armies to root out li zicheng from the important city of xi'an ( shaanxi province ) , where li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing beijing in early june 1644 . from newly captured xi'an , in early april 1645 , the qing forces mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of jiangnan south of the lower yangtze river , where in june 1644 prince of fu had established a regime loyal to the ming dorgon 's brother dodo received the command to lead this '' southern expedition '' ( nan zheng 南征 ) on april 1 the ming prince had been crowned as emperor on 19 june 1644 ; several qing armies swept south , taking the key city of xuzhou north of the huai river in early may 1645 and soon converging on yangzhou , the main city on the southern ming 's northern line of defence it is difficult to prove verbal accusations made at the time when all records were ordered to be purged by emperor qianlong in 1778 when he also ordered the rehabilitation of dorgon the extermination of dorgon 's heirs did not include his daughter , whose birth year of 1650 , the same year when dorgon died , was allowed to be left on records

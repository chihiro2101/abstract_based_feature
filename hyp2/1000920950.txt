dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 during hong taiji 's reign , dorgon participated in many military campaigns , including the conquests of mongolia and korea after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor since the shunzhi emperor was only six years old at that time , dorgon was appointed regent and became the de facto ruler in 1645 , dorgon was conferred the title '' emperor 's uncle and prince-regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) later , in 1649 , the title was changed to '' emperor 's father and prince-regent '' ( 皇父攝政王 ) it was rumoured that dorgon had a romantic affair with the shunzhi emperor 's mother , empress dowager xiaozhuang , and even secretly married her , but there are also refutations however , according to han chinese custom , such a marriage was taboo . after an alleged plot by hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 may of that year , hooge was stripped of his princely title and his co-conspirators were executed . in early 1644 , just as dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the ming empire , peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching beijing on 24 april of that year , rebel forces led by li zicheng breached the walls of the ming capital . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire the last obstacle between dorgon and beijing was wu sangui , a former ming general guarding the shanhai pass at the eastern end of the great wall he requested dorgon 's help in ousting the rebels and restoring the ming empire . when dorgon asked wu sangui to work for the qing empire instead , wu had little choice but to accept . li zicheng and his defeated troops looted beijing for several days until they left the capital on 4 june with all the wealth they could carry . they were startled when , instead of meeting wu sangui and the ming heir apparent , they saw dorgon , a horse-riding manchu with the front half of his head shaved , present himself as the prince regent ( were all expecting wu sangui and the heir apparent ) and 315 ( reaction to seeing dorgon instead ) in the midst of this upheaval , dorgon installed himself as prince-regent in wuying palace ( 武英殿 ) , the only building that remained more or less intact after li zicheng had set fire to the forbidden city on 3 june besides , all the men had to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues he had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around beijing , threatening qing control over the capital region dorgon greeted the shunzhi emperor at the gates of beijing on 19 october 1644 during the ceremony , dorgon 's official title was raised from '' prince regent '' to '' uncle and prince regent '' ( 叔父攝政王 ) , in which the manchu term for '' uncle '' ( ecike ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince three days later dorgon 's co-regent , jirgalang , was demoted from '' prince regent '' to '' assistant uncle prince regent '' ( 輔政叔王 ) dorgon gave a manchu woman as a wife to the han chinese official feng quan , who had defected from the ming to the qing the manchu queue hairstyle was willingly adopted by feng quan before it was enforced on the han population and feng learned the manchu language one of dorgon 's first orders in the new qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of beijing and give it to bannermen , including han chinese bannermen . agricultural land outside the capital was also delineated ( quan 圈 ) and given to qing troops in the very first imperial examination held under qing rule in 1646 , candidates , most of whom were northern chinese , were asked how the manchus and han chinese could work together for a common purpose under the shunzhi emperor 's reign , the average number of graduates of the metropolitan examination per session was the highest of the qing dynasty ( '' to win more chinese support '' ) , continuing until 1660 when lower quotas were established , table 1.1 ( number of graduates per session under each qing reign ) ; ( reason for the high quotas ) ; ( lower quotas in 1660 ) ( capture of suzhou and hangzhou by early july 1645 ; new frontier ) ; ( capture of the emperor around 17 june , and later death in beijing ) the old chinese habit of wearing a queue came from dorgon 's july 1645 edict ordering all men to shave the front half of their head and wear the rest of their hair in a queue similar to those of the manchus on 21 july 1645 , after jiangnan had been superficially pacified , dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all han chinese men to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues identical to those of the manchus this time , jirgalang succeeded in convincing emperor shunzhi that even dorgon 's descendants could become a threat to the throne however , dorgon was posthumously rehabilitated during qianlong emperor 's reign after dorgon led manchu and han chinese troops loyal to him into beijing on june 6 , 1644 , he immediately ordered restoration of order , as well as penalties for extortion and corruption activities conducted by any member of the imperial clan and other officials prince rui ( 睿 ) royal and noble ranks of the qing dynasty male members ranks of imperial consorts in china qing qing conquest of the ming

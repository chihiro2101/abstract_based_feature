dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) ajige and dodo were his full brothers , and hong taiji was one of his half-brothers dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 during hong taiji 's reign , dorgon participated in many military campaigns , including the conquests of mongolia and korea after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor since the shunzhi emperor was only six years old at that time , dorgon was appointed regent and became the de facto ruler in 1645 , dorgon was conferred the title '' emperor 's uncle and prince-regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) later , in 1649 , the title was changed to '' emperor 's father and prince-regent '' ( 皇父攝政王 ) it was rumoured that dorgon had a romantic affair with the shunzhi emperor 's mother , empress dowager xiaozhuang , and even secretly married her , but there are also refutations whether they secretly married , according to manchu custom , a widowed woman can marry her brother-in-law . after an alleged plot by hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 may of that year , hooge was stripped of his princely title and his co-conspirators were executed dorgon soon replaced hooge 's supporters ( mostly from the yellow banners ) with his own , thus gaining closer control of two more banners . in early 1644 , just as dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the ming empire , peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching beijing . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire the last obstacle between dorgon and beijing was wu sangui , a former ming general guarding the shanhai pass at the eastern end of the great wall he requested dorgon 's help in ousting the rebels and restoring the ming empire . when dorgon asked wu sangui to work for the qing empire instead , wu had little choice but to accept . li zicheng and his defeated troops looted beijing for several days until they left the capital on 4 june with all the wealth they could carry . they were startled when , instead of meeting wu sangui and the ming heir apparent , they saw dorgon , a horse-riding manchu with the front half of his head shaved , present himself as the prince regent . banner troops were ordered not to loot ; their discipline made the transition to qing rule '' remarkably smooth yet , at the same time , as he claimed to have come to avenge the ming empire , dorgon ordered that all claimants to the ming throne ( including descendants of the last ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters . on june 7 , just two days after entering the city , dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital , assuring them that if the local population surrendered , the officials would be allowed to stay at their posts besides , all the men had to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues dorgon greeted the shunzhi emperor at the gates of beijing on 19 october 1644 a formal ritual of enthronement for the shunzhi emperor was held on 8 november , during which the young emperor compared dorgon 's achievements to those of the duke of zhou , a revered regent of the zhou dynasty three days later dorgon 's co-regent , jirgalang , was demoted from '' prince regent '' to '' assistant uncle prince regent '' ( 輔政叔王 ) . in june 1645 , dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as '' imperial uncle prince regent '' ( 皇叔父攝政王 ) , leaving him one step short of claiming the throne for himself one of dorgon 's first orders in the new qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of beijing and give it to bannermen , including han chinese bannermen the yellow banners were given the place of honor north of the palace , followed by the white banners to the east , the red banners to the west , and the blue banners to the south under the shunzhi emperor 's reign , the average number of graduates of the metropolitan examination per session was the highest of the qing dynasty ( '' to win more chinese support '' ) , continuing until 1660 when lower quotas were established under the reign of dorgon – whom historians have called '' the mastermind of the qing conquest '' and '' the principal architect of the great manchu enterprise '' – the qing subdued almost all of china and pushed loyalist '' southern ming '' resistance into the far southwestern reaches of china several qing armies swept south , taking the key city of xuzhou north of the huai river in early may 1645 and soon converging on yangzhou , the main city on the southern ming 's northern line of defence . the qing forces soon captured the ming emperor ( who died in beijing the following year ) and seized jiangnan 's main cities , including suzhou and hangzhou ; by early july 1645 , the frontier between the qing empire and the southern ming regime had been pushed south to the qiantang river the old chinese habit of wearing a queue came from dorgon 's july 1645 edict ordering all men to shave the front half of their head and wear the rest of their hair in a queue similar to those of the manchus another cause for suspicion is that dorgon 's corpse was exhumed , flogged , and incinerated in the purge ordered by emperor shunzhi , a likely method camouflaged as the ultimate punishment for his alleged plot to take over the throne , in order to remove all evidence that dorgon was murdered it is difficult to prove verbal accusations made at the time when all records were ordered to be purged by emperor qianlong in 1778 when he also ordered the rehabilitation of dorgon this time , jirgalang succeeded in convincing emperor shunzhi that even dorgon 's descendants could become a threat to the throne as a chinese character , yuan 袁 ( yuen ) substantially resembles the word '' gon 袞 '' as in '' dorgon 多尔袞 '' in the written form prince rui ( 睿 ) royal and noble ranks of the qing dynasty male members ranks of imperial consorts in china qing qing conquest of the ming

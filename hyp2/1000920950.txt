dorgon was born in the manchu aisin gioro clan as the 14th son of nurhaci , the khan of the later jin dynasty ( the precursor to the qing dynasty ) dorgon was one of the most influential among nurhaci 's sons , and his role was instrumental to the qing occupation of beijing , the capital of the fallen ming dynasty , in 1644 after hong taiji died in 1643 , dorgon became involved in a power struggle with hong taiji 's eldest son , hooge , over the succession to the throne the conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out , and hong taiji 's ninth son , fulin , ascended the throne as the shunzhi emperor since the shunzhi emperor was only six years old at that time , dorgon was appointed regent and became the de facto ruler it was rumoured that dorgon had a romantic affair with the shunzhi emperor 's mother , empress dowager xiaozhuang , and even secretly married her , but there are also refutations dorgon 's regency ( 1643–1650 ) on 17 february 1644 , jirgalang , who was a capable military leader but appeared uninterested in managing state affairs , willingly yielded control of all official matters to dorgon . after an alleged plot by hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 may of that year , hooge was stripped of his princely title and his co-conspirators were executed . in early 1644 , just as dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the ming empire , peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching beijing on 24 april of that year , rebel forces led by li zicheng breached the walls of the ming capital the last ming emperor , the chongzhen emperor , hanged himself at a hill behind the forbidden city . hearing the news , dorgon 's han chinese advisors hong chengchou and fan wencheng ( 范文程 ; 1597–1666 ) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen ming empire and claim the mandate of heaven for the qing empire the last obstacle between dorgon and beijing was wu sangui , a former ming general guarding the shanhai pass at the eastern end of the great wall he requested dorgon 's help in ousting the rebels and restoring the ming empire . aided by wu sangui 's elite soldiers , who fought the rebel army for hours before dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry , the qing army won a decisive victory against li zicheng at the battle of shanhai pass on 27 may ( were all expecting wu sangui and the heir apparent ) and 315 ( reaction to seeing dorgon instead ) in the midst of this upheaval , dorgon installed himself as prince-regent in wuying palace ( 武英殿 ) , the only building that remained more or less intact after li zicheng had set fire to the forbidden city on 3 june yet , at the same time , as he claimed to have come to avenge the ming empire , dorgon ordered that all claimants to the ming throne ( including descendants of the last ming emperor ) should be executed along with their supporters . on june 7 , just two days after entering the city , dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital , assuring them that if the local population surrendered , the officials would be allowed to stay at their posts he had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around beijing , threatening qing control over the capital region . the southern cadet branch of confucius 's descendants who held the title wujing boshi and the northern branch 65th generation descendant of confucius to hold the title duke yansheng had their titles confirmed by the shunzhi emperor on 31 october a formal ritual of enthronement for the shunzhi emperor was held on 8 november , during which the young emperor compared dorgon 's achievements to those of the duke of zhou , a revered regent of the zhou dynasty 858 and 860 ( '' according to the emperor 's speechwriter , who was probably fan wencheng , dorgon even 'surpassed ' ( guo ) the revered duke of zhou because 'the uncle prince also led the grand army through shanhai pass to smash two hundred thousand bandit soldiers , and then proceeded to take yanjing , pacifying the central xia during the ceremony , dorgon 's official title was raised from '' prince regent '' to '' uncle and prince regent '' ( 叔父攝政王 ) , in which the manchu term for '' uncle '' ( ecike ) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince three days later dorgon 's co-regent , jirgalang , was demoted from '' prince regent '' to '' assistant uncle prince regent '' ( 輔政叔王 ) dorgon gave a manchu woman as a wife to the han chinese official feng quan , who had defected from the ming to the qing . the 1649 examination asked '' how manchus and han chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division , table 1.1 ( number of graduates per session under each qing reign ) ; ( reason for the high quotas ) ; ( lower quotas in 1660 ) dorgon 's brother dodo received the command to lead this '' southern expedition '' ( nan zheng 南征 ) on april 1 indeed , nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 june after its last defenders made dodo promise he would not harm the population . the qing forces soon captured the ming emperor ( who died in beijing the following year ) and seized jiangnan 's main cities , including suzhou and hangzhou ; by early july 1645 , the frontier between the qing empire and the southern ming regime had been pushed south to the qiantang river ( capture of suzhou and hangzhou by early july 1645 ; new frontier ) ; ( capture of the emperor around 17 june , and later death in beijing ) on 21 july 1645 , after jiangnan had been superficially pacified , dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all han chinese men to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues identical to those of the manchus ( '' from the manchus ' perspective , the command to cut one 's hair or lose one 's head not only brought rulers and subjects together into a single physical resemblance ; it also provided them with a perfect loyalty test '' ) because it united chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against qing rule , the hair cutting command greatly hindered the qing conquest when the city walls were finally breached on 9 october 1645 , the qing army led by the previous ming defector liu liangzuo ( 劉良佐 ; d the official qing history claim that he injured his leg while riding on his horse and that the injuries were so severe that he could not survive the trip back to the forbidden city , despite the presence of imperial doctors , was dubious at best in 1778 , the qianlong emperor granted dorgon a posthumous name zhong ( 忠 ; '' loyal '' ) , so dorgon 's full posthumous title became '' prince ruizhong of the first rank '' ( 和碩睿忠親王 ) records in the imperial ancestral temple indicate that none of his 10 wives and concubines was able to conceive a son for dorgon over a period of 25 years , whereas only a daughter was born at the end of this 25-year period , in the same year when he died

headphones grew out of the need to free up a person 's hands when operating a telephone french engineer ernest mercadier patented a set of in-ear headphones in 1891 , mercadier was awarded u.s ‚Äù nathaniel baldwin of utah in 1910 invented a prototype telephone headset due to his inability to hear sermons during sunday service thumb headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece , and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used , so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance , resulting in poor sound quality their impedance varied ; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 & nbsp ; ohms impedance of 1,000 to 2,000 & nbsp ; ohms was common , which suited both crystal sets and triode receivers previously , headphones were used only by the us navy , telephone and radio operators , and individuals in similar industries smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids they became widely used with transistor radios , which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the regency tr-1 the earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a crystal earpiece to produce sound the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm radio and phone connector , which is the most commonly used in portable application today , has been used at least since the sony efm-117j transistor radio , which was released in 1964 headphones may be used with stationary cd and dvd players , home cinema , personal computers , or portable devices ( e.g instead , they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link , such as fm , bluetooth or wi-fi these are powered receiver systems , of which the headphone is only a component cordless headphones are used with events such as a silent disco or silent gig in radio studios , djs use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their own voice in studio recordings , musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable the larger 6.35 & nbsp ; mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment specific models of headphones have been adopted as the standard due to the ease of calibration and ability to compare results between testing facilities circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range ( 8,000 & nbsp ; hz to 20,000 & nbsp ; khz ) during the calibration process , the output signal from the audiometer to the headphones is measured with a sound level meter to ensure that the signal is accurate to the reading on the audiometer for sound pressure level and frequency because specific headphones are used in the initial audiometer calibration process , they can not be replaced with any other set of headphones , even from the same make and model electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones , because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers headphones are available with high or low impedance ( typically measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz ) low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32 & nbsp ; ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600 & nbsp ; ohms as the impedance of a pair of headphones increases , more voltage ( at a given current ) is required to drive it , and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases the impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers a modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier , with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load to ensure an even frequency response , adequate damping factor , and undistorted sound , an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving ( and ideally , as low as possible ) higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations , but produce less volume for a given output level in contrast , modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance , enabling lower-impedance headphones once the sensitivity per volt is known , the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage for example , for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v , an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square ( rms ) voltage produces a maximum volume of 100 & nbsp ; db pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones the maximum sound pressure level is a matter of preference , with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120 & nbsp ; db using this standard , headphones with sensitivities of 90 , 100 and 110 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162 , 1.0 and 0.3162 rms volts at maximum volume setting , respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage thumb circumaural headphones ( sometimes called full size headphones or over-ear headphones ) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears thumb supra-aural headphones or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears , rather than around them they were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups : open-back headphones have the back of the earcups open this leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone , but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound , due to including sounds from the environment closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear , facing but not inserted in the ear canal since the early days of the transistor radio , earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal , they can be prone to sliding out , and they block out much environmental noise such headsets are used in a variety of professions as aviation , military , sports , music , and many service-oriented sectors the thermoacoustic effect generates sound from the audio frequency joule heating of the conductor , an effect that is not magnetic and does not vibrate the speaker using headphones at a sufficiently high volume level may cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) recommends sound exposure not exceed 85 & nbsp ; db ( a ) over 8 hour work day as a time-weighted average

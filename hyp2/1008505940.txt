headphones grew out of the need to free up a person 's hands when operating a telephone there were several iterative products that were predecessors to the '' hands-free '' headphones french engineer ernest mercadier patented a set of in-ear headphones in 1891 , mercadier was awarded u.s 454,138 for “ improvements in telephone-receivers…which shall be light enough to be carried while in use on the head of the operator ” nathaniel baldwin of utah in 1910 invented a prototype telephone headset due to his inability to hear sermons during sunday service in partnership with baldwin radio company set up a manufacturing facility in utah to fulfill orders thumb headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece , and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the requirement for high sensitivity meant that no damping was used , so the frequency response of the diaphragm had large peaks due to resonance , resulting in poor sound quality their impedance varied ; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 & nbsp ; ohms some very sensitive headphones , such as those manufactured by brandes around 1919 , were commonly used for early radio work in early powered radios , the headphone was part of the vacuum tube 's plate circuit and carried dangerous voltages previously , headphones were used only by the us navy , telephone and radio operators , and individuals in similar industries they became widely used with transistor radios , which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the regency tr-1 the most popular audio device in history , the transistor radio changed listening habits , allowing people to listen to radio anywhere the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm radio and phone connector , which is the most commonly used in portable application today , has been used at least since the sony efm-117j transistor radio , which was released in 1964 description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model : its popularity was reinforced with its use on the walkman portable tape player in 1979 headphones may be used with stationary cd and dvd players , home cinema , personal computers , or portable devices ( e.g , digital audio player/mp3 player , mobile phone ) cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable instead , they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link , such as fm , bluetooth or wi-fi in the professional audio sector , headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a dj mixer , and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources in radio studios , djs use a pair of headphones when talking to the microphone while the speakers are turned off to eliminate acoustic feedback while monitoring their own voice in studio recordings , musicians and singers use headphones to play or sing along to a backing track or band wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable the larger 6.35 & nbsp ; mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment adapters are available for converting between 6.35 & nbsp ; mm and 3.5 & nbsp ; mm devices specific models of headphones have been adopted as the standard due to the ease of calibration and ability to compare results between testing facilities a commonly used model of insert earphone is the etymotic research er-3a circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range ( 8,000 & nbsp ; hz to 20,000 & nbsp ; khz ) headphones are available with high or low impedance ( typically measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz ) in recent years , impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered cmos-based portable electronics a modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier , with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load amplifiers are not ideal ; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide therefore , lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient , but also demand a more capable amplifier historically , many headphones had relatively high impedance , often over 500 & nbsp ; ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers in contrast , modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance , enabling lower-impedance headphones sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound once the sensitivity per volt is known , the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage the maximum sound pressure level is a matter of preference , with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120 & nbsp ; db because of their size , circumaural headphones can be heavy and there are some sets that weigh over thumb supra-aural headphones or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears , rather than around them supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones iems are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation communication headsets are used for two-way communication and typically consist of a headphone and attached microphone they come in all shapes and sizes , depending on use , required noise attenuation , and fidelity of communication needed passive noise isolation is essentially using the body of the earphone , either over or in the ear , as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12 & nbsp ; db , and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15 & nbsp ; db today they are typically used only in in-ear headphones and hearing aids , where their high efficiency and diminutive size is a major advantage headphones can prevent other people from hearing the sound , either for privacy or to prevent disturbing others , as in listening in a public library , pilots , call centre and dispatch operators , audio engineerfirefighter , etc

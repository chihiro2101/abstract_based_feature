headphones grew out of the need to free up a person 's hands when operating a telephone there were several iterative products that were predecessors to the '' hands-free '' headphones 454,138 for “ improvements in telephone-receivers…which shall be light enough to be carried while in use on the head of the operator in partnership with baldwin radio company set up a manufacturing facility in utah to fulfill orders thumb headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece , and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet , which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm the audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet , exerting a varying force on the diaphragm , causing it to vibrate , creating sound waves their impedance varied ; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 & nbsp ; ohms some very sensitive headphones , such as those manufactured by brandes around 1919 , were commonly used for early radio work previously , headphones were used only by the us navy , telephone and radio operators , and individuals in similar industries smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids the most popular audio device in history , the transistor radio changed listening habits , allowing people to listen to radio anywhere the earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a crystal earpiece to produce sound the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm radio and phone connector , which is the most commonly used in portable application today , has been used at least since the sony efm-117j transistor radio , which was released in 1964 headphones may be used with stationary cd and dvd players , home cinema , personal computers , or portable devices ( e.g instead , they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link , such as fm , bluetooth or wi-fi cordless headphones are used with events such as a silent disco or silent gig wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable the larger 6.35 & nbsp ; mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today adapters are available for converting between 6.35 & nbsp ; mm and 3.5 & nbsp ; mm devices applications for audiometric testing circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range ( 8,000 & nbsp ; hz to 20,000 & nbsp ; khz ) during the calibration process , the output signal from the audiometer to the headphones is measured with a sound level meter to ensure that the signal is accurate to the reading on the audiometer for sound pressure level and frequency electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones , because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers headphones are available with high or low impedance ( typically measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz ) as the impedance of a pair of headphones increases , more voltage ( at a given current ) is required to drive it , and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases this has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics consequently , newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance a modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier , with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load if output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones , significantly higher distortion is present therefore , lower impedance headphones tend to be louder and more efficient , but also demand a more capable amplifier in contrast , modern transistor amplifiers can have very low output impedance , enabling lower-impedance headphones sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound it thus indicates how loud the headphones are for a given electrical drive level for example , for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v , an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square ( rms ) voltage produces a maximum volume of 100 & nbsp ; db pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones the sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125 & nbsp ; db/mw and usually measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz thumb circumaural headphones ( sometimes called full size headphones or over-ear headphones ) have circular or ellipsoid earpads that encompass the ears because these headphones completely surround the ear , circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise thumb supra-aural headphones or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears , rather than around them supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups : open-back headphones have the back of the earcups open earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear , facing but not inserted in the ear canal they provide hardly any acoustic isolation and leave room for ambient noise to seep in ; users may turn up the volume dangerously high to compensate , at the risk of causing hearing loss ( the use of the term earbuds , which has been around since at least 1984 , did not hit its peak until after 2001 , with the success of apple 's mp3 player thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon although this reduces its efficiency , this design can still produce more sound from less power than any other magnetostriction headphones though , are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear hard panned sounds are also heard only in one ear rather than from one side hearing risk from headphones ' use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job ( i.e

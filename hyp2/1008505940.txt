headphones grew out of the need to free up a person 's hands when operating a telephone there were several iterative products that were predecessors to the '' hands-free '' headphones 454,138 for “ improvements in telephone-receivers…which shall be light enough to be carried while in use on the head of the operator ” nathaniel baldwin of utah in 1910 invented a prototype telephone headset due to his inability to hear sermons during sunday service thumb headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece , and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet , exerting a varying force on the diaphragm , causing it to vibrate , creating sound waves their impedance varied ; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 & nbsp ; ohms those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity the use of bare electrical connections meant that users could be shocked if they touched the bare headphone connections while adjusting an uncomfortable headset previously , headphones were used only by the us navy , telephone and radio operators , and individuals in similar industries smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids they became widely used with transistor radios , which commercially appeared in 1954 with the introduction of the regency tr-1 the most popular audio device in history , the transistor radio changed listening habits , allowing people to listen to radio anywhere description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model : its popularity was reinforced with its use on the walkman portable tape player in 1979 in the professional audio sector , headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a dj mixer , and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources in military applications , audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones the larger 6.35 & nbsp ; mm connector is more common on fixed location home or professional equipment the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today adapters are available for converting between 6.35 & nbsp ; mm and 3.5 & nbsp ; mm devices specific models of headphones have been adopted as the standard due to the ease of calibration and ability to compare results between testing facilities supra-aural style headphones are historically the most commonly used in audiology as they are the easiest to calibrate and were considered the standard for many years circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range ( 8,000 & nbsp ; hz to 20,000 & nbsp ; khz ) electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers may be readily applied to headphones , because most headphones are small dynamic loudspeakers in recent years , impedance of newer headphones has generally decreased to accommodate lower voltages available on battery powered cmos-based portable electronics this has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics the impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers a modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier , with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load to ensure an even frequency response , adequate damping factor , and undistorted sound , an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving ( and ideally , as low as possible ) if output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones , significantly higher distortion is present higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations , but produce less volume for a given output level unfortunately , this means that older audio amplifiers or stereos often produce poor-quality output on some modern , low-impedance headphones it can be measured in decibels of sound pressure level per milliwatt ( db ( spl ) /mw ) or decibels of sound pressure level per volt ( db ( spl ) / v ) pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones the maximum sound pressure level is a matter of preference , with some sources recommending no higher than 110 to 120 & nbsp ; db using this standard , headphones with sensitivities of 90 , 100 and 110 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162 , 1.0 and 0.3162 rms volts at maximum volume setting , respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage the sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125 & nbsp ; db/mw and usually measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz generally , headphone form factors can be divided into four separate categories : circumaural ( over-ear ) , supra-aural ( on-ear ) , earbud and in-ear because these headphones completely surround the ear , circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear both circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be further differentiated by the type of earcups : open-back headphones have the back of the earcups open they usually block some of the ambient noise semi-open headphones , have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones on the other hand , they let the user be better aware of their surroundings thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself iems are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles lack of sound from the environment can be a problem when sound is a necessary cue for safety or other reasons , as when walking , driving , or riding near or in vehicular traffic custom in-ear headphones use castings of the ear canal to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation headphones use various types of transducer to convert electrical signals to sound when these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional dome headphone driver , headphones can be produced that are recognised by the japan audio society as worthy of joining the hi res audio program magnetostriction headphones though , are limited in their fidelity compared to conventional headphones that rely on the normal workings of the ear binaural recordings use a different microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase , with very little amplitude difference below 2 & nbsp ; khz , often using a dummy head hearing risk from headphones ' use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job ( i.e

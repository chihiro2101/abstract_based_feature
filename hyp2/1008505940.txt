headphones grew out of the need to free up a person 's hands when operating a telephone there were several iterative products that were predecessors to the '' hands-free '' headphones french engineer ernest mercadier patented a set of in-ear headphones in 1891 , mercadier was awarded u.s thumb headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece , and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet , exerting a varying force on the diaphragm , causing it to vibrate , creating sound waves these early models lacked padding , and were often uncomfortable to wear for long periods those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity some very sensitive headphones , such as those manufactured by brandes around 1919 , were commonly used for early radio work koss , an audiophile and jazz musician from milwaukee , produced the first stereo headphones previously , headphones were used only by the us navy , telephone and radio operators , and individuals in similar industries smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids the most popular audio device in history , the transistor radio changed listening habits , allowing people to listen to radio anywhere the earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a crystal earpiece to produce sound the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm radio and phone connector , which is the most commonly used in portable application today , has been used at least since the sony efm-117j transistor radio , which was released in 1964 description of 3.5mm earphone jack in described model : its popularity was reinforced with its use on the walkman portable tape player in 1979 headphones may be used with stationary cd and dvd players , home cinema , personal computers , or portable devices ( e.g instead , they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link , such as fm , bluetooth or wi-fi cordless headphones are used with events such as a silent disco or silent gig in military applications , audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones the 3.5 & nbsp ; mm connector remains the most widely used connector for portable application today specific models of headphones have been adopted as the standard due to the ease of calibration and ability to compare results between testing facilities supra-aural style headphones are historically the most commonly used in audiology as they are the easiest to calibrate and were considered the standard for many years circum-aural earphones are also used to establish hearing thresholds in the extended high frequency range ( 8,000 & nbsp ; hz to 20,000 & nbsp ; khz ) calibration is done with the earphones in an acoustic coupler that is intended to mimic the transfer function of the outer ear because specific headphones are used in the initial audiometer calibration process , they can not be replaced with any other set of headphones , even from the same make and model headphones are available with high or low impedance ( typically measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz ) low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32 & nbsp ; ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600 & nbsp ; ohms as the impedance of a pair of headphones increases , more voltage ( at a given current ) is required to drive it , and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases this has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics consequently , newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance a modern pair of headphones is driven by an amplifier , with lower impedance headphones presenting a larger load higher impedance headphones are more tolerant of amplifier limitations , but produce less volume for a given output level sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound once the sensitivity per volt is known , the maximum volume for a pair of headphones can be easily calculated from the maximum amplifier output voltage for example , for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v , an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square ( rms ) voltage produces a maximum volume of 100 & nbsp ; db pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones the sensitivity of headphones is usually between about 80 and 125 & nbsp ; db/mw and usually measured at 1 & nbsp ; khz because these headphones completely surround the ear , circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise thumb supra-aural headphones or on-ear headphones have pads that press against the ears , rather than around them supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear this leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone , but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound , due to including sounds from the environment semi-open headphones , have a design that can be considered as a compromise between open-back headphones and closed-back headphones earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear , facing but not inserted in the ear canal on the other hand , they let the user be better aware of their surroundings thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself iems are higher-quality in-ear headphones and are used by audio engineers and musicians as well as audiophiles the outer shells of in-ear headphones are made up of a variety of materials , such as plastic , aluminum , ceramic and other metal alloys because in-ear headphones engage the ear canal , they can be prone to sliding out , and they block out much environmental noise high-quality headphones can have an extremely flat low-frequency response down to 20 & nbsp ; hz within 3 & nbsp ; db using headphones at a sufficiently high volume level may cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment or deafness the usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power hearing risk from headphones ' use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job ( i.e

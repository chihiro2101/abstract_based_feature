headphones grew out of the need to free up a person 's hands when operating a telephone subscribers to the service could listen to the performance through a pair of massive earphones that connected below the chin , held by a long rod french engineer ernest mercadier patented a set of in-ear headphones in 1891 , mercadier was awarded u.s 454,138 for “ improvements in telephone-receivers…which shall be light enough to be carried while in use on the head of the operator his innovations were the basis of “ sound-powered ” telephones or phones that required no electricity , which were used during world war ii thumb headphones originated from the telephone receiver earpiece , and were the only way to listen to electrical audio signals before amplifiers were developed these early headphones used moving iron speaker , with either single-ended or balanced armatures the common single-ended type used voice coils wound around the poles of a permanent magnet , which were positioned close to a flexible steel diaphragm the audio current through the coils varied the magnetic field of the magnet , exerting a varying force on the diaphragm , causing it to vibrate , creating sound waves their impedance varied ; headphones used in telegraph and telephone work had an impedance of 75 & nbsp ; ohms those used with early wireless radio had more turns of finer wire to increase sensitivity some very sensitive headphones , such as those manufactured by brandes around 1919 , were commonly used for early radio work in early powered radios , the headphone was part of the vacuum tube 's plate circuit and carried dangerous voltages koss , an audiophile and jazz musician from milwaukee , produced the first stereo headphones previously , headphones were used only by the us navy , telephone and radio operators , and individuals in similar industries smaller earbud type earpieces , which plugged into the user 's ear canal , were first developed for hearing aids the most popular audio device in history , the transistor radio changed listening habits , allowing people to listen to radio anywhere the earbud uses either a moving iron driver or a crystal earpiece to produce sound , digital audio player/mp3 player , mobile phone ) instead , they receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link , such as fm , bluetooth or wi-fi cordless headphones are used with events such as a silent disco or silent gig in the professional audio sector , headphones are used in live situations by disc jockeys with a dj mixer , and sound engineers for monitoring signal sources in military applications , audio signals of many varieties are monitored using headphones wired headphones are attached to an audio source by a cable adapters are available for converting between 6.35 & nbsp ; mm and 3.5 & nbsp ; mm devices supra-aural style headphones are historically the most commonly used in audiology as they are the easiest to calibrate and were considered the standard for many years in-the-ear or insert style earphones are used more commonly today as they provide higher levels of interaural attenuation , introduce less variability when testing 6,000 and 8,000 & nbsp ; hz , and avoid testing issues resulting from collapsed ear canals because specific headphones are used in the initial audiometer calibration process , they can not be replaced with any other set of headphones , even from the same make and model low-impedance headphones are in the range 16 to 32 & nbsp ; ohms and high-impedance headphones are about 100-600 & nbsp ; ohms as the impedance of a pair of headphones increases , more voltage ( at a given current ) is required to drive it , and the loudness of the headphones for a given voltage decreases this has resulted in headphones that can be more efficiently driven by battery-powered electronics consequently , newer amplifiers are based on designs with relatively low output impedance the impedance of headphones is of concern because of the output limitations of amplifiers amplifiers are not ideal ; they also have some output impedance that limits the amount of power they can provide to ensure an even frequency response , adequate damping factor , and undistorted sound , an amplifier should have an output impedance less than 1/8 that of the headphones it is driving ( and ideally , as low as possible ) if output impedance is large compared to the impedance of the headphones , significantly higher distortion is present historically , many headphones had relatively high impedance , often over 500 & nbsp ; ohms so they could operate well with high-impedance tube amplifiers sensitivity is a measure of how effectively an earpiece converts an incoming electrical signal into an audible sound for example , for a headphone with a sensitivity of 100 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v , an amplifier with an output of 1 root mean square ( rms ) voltage produces a maximum volume of 100 & nbsp ; db pairing high sensitivity headphones with power amplifiers can produce dangerously high volumes and damage headphones using this standard , headphones with sensitivities of 90 , 100 and 110 & nbsp ; db ( spl ) /v should be driven by an amplifier capable of no more than 3.162 , 1.0 and 0.3162 rms volts at maximum volume setting , respectively to reduce the risk of hearing damage because these headphones completely surround the ear , circumaural headphones can be designed to fully seal against the head to attenuate external noise supra-aural headphones can also lead to discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones that sit around the ear this leaks more sound out of the headphone and also lets more ambient sounds into the headphone , but gives a more natural or speaker-like sound , due to including sounds from the environment closed-back headphones usually can produce stronger low frequencies than open-back headphones where the open-back approach has hardly any measure to block sound at the outer side of the diaphragm and the closed-back approach really has a closed chamber at the outer side of the diaphragm , a semi-open headphone can have a chamber to partially block sound while letting some sound through via openings or vents earphones are very small headphones that are fitted directly in the outer ear , facing but not inserted in the ear canal since the early days of the transistor radio , earphones have commonly been bundled with personal music devices thumb in-ear headphones , also known as in-ear monitors ( iems ) or canalphones , are small headphones with similar portability to earbuds that are inserted in the ear canal itself electrostatic headphones require a voltage source generating 100 & nbsp ; v to over 1 & nbsp ; kv , and are on the user 's head it is possible to change the spatial effects of stereo sound on headphones , to better approximate the presentation of speaker reproduction , by using frequency-dependent cross-feed between the channels the usual way of limiting sound volume on devices driving headphones is by limiting output power hearing risk from headphones ' use also applies to workers who must wear electronic or communication headsets as part of their daily job ( i.e

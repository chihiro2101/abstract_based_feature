in most kelp , the thallus ( or body ) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as blades the holdfast , a root-like structure , anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean gas-filled bladders ( pneumatocysts ) form at the base of blades of american species , such as nereocystis lueteana , ( mert sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the ne atlantic estuarine , coastal and shelf science 95 : 135-144 the kelp life cycle involves a ploidy sporophyte and haploid gametophyte stage kelp may develop dense forests with high production , abdullah , m.i production , respiration and exudation of dissolved organic matter by the kelp laminaria hyperborea along the west coast of norway species distribution and habitat exploitation of fauna associated with kelp ( laminaria hyperborea ) along the norwegian coast colonisation of kelp imitations by epiphyte and holdfast fauna ; a study of mobility patterns m√ºller ) are important secondary consumers controlling large barren ground areas on the norwegian coast , they are scarce inside dense kelp forests sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the ne atlantic giant kelp can be harvested fairly easily because of its surface canopy and growth habit of staying in deeper water in great amount , kelp ash can be used in soap and glass production until the leblanc process was commercialized in the early 19th century , burning of kelp in scotland was one of the principal industrial sources of soda ash ( predominantly sodium carbonate ) the kelp ash would consist of around 5 % sodium carbonate 558 once the leblanc process became commercially viable in britain during the 1820s , common salt replaced kelp ash as raw material for sodium carbonate though the price of kelp ash went into steep decline , seaweed remained the only commercial source of iodine iodine was extracted from kelp ash using a lixiviation process 482 , 185-199 as with sodium carbonate however , mineral sources eventually replaced seaweed in iodine production alginate powder is also used frequently in general dentistry and orthodontics for making impressions of the upper and lower arches 270 kelp polysaccharides are used in skin care as gelling ingredients and because of the benefits provided by fucoidan graimes , nicola : the best-ever vegetarian cookbook , barnes & noble books , 1999 , p in 2010 , researchers found that alginate , the soluble fibre substance in sea kelp , was better at preventing fat absorption than most over-the-counter slimming treatments in laboratory trials between the 1950s and the 1980s , kelp production in china increased from about 60 to over 250,000 dry weight metric tons annually kelp has a high rate of growth and its decay is quite efficient in yielding methane , as well as sugars that can be converted to ethanol during the highland clearances , many scottish highlanders were moved on to areas of estates known as crofts , and went to industries such as fishing and kelping ( producing soda ash from the ashes of kelp ) kombu , saccharina japonica ( formerly laminaria japonica ) and others , several edible species of kelp found in japan america ) other species in the laminariales that may be considered as kelp : alaria esculenta ( north atlantic ) alaria marginata post some animals are named after the kelp , either because they inhabit the same habitat as kelp or because they feed on kelp

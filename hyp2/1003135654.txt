in most kelp , the thallus ( or body ) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as blades the holdfast , a root-like structure , anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean gas-filled bladders ( pneumatocysts ) form at the base of blades of american species , such as nereocystis lueteana , ( mert ) to hold the kelp blades close to the surface sea urchins , for example , can reduce entire areas to urchin barrens sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the ne atlantic estuarine , coastal and shelf science 95 : 135-144 the kelp life cycle involves a ploidy sporophyte and haploid gametophyte stage the haploid phase begins when the mature organism releases many spores , which then germinate to become male or female gametophytes kelp may develop dense forests with high production , abdullah , m.i production , respiration and exudation of dissolved organic matter by the kelp laminaria hyperborea along the west coast of norway journal of the marine biological association of the uk 84 : 887 along the norwegian coast these forests cover 5800 & nbsp ; km 2 , rinde , e dokumentasjon av modellerte marine naturtyper i dns naturbase species distribution and habitat exploitation of fauna associated with kelp ( laminaria hyperborea ) along the norwegian coast colonisation of kelp imitations by epiphyte and holdfast fauna ; a study of mobility patterns more than 100,000 mobile invertebrates per square meter are found on kelp stipes and holdfasts in well-developed kelp forests ( christie et al m√ºller ) are important secondary consumers controlling large barren ground areas on the norwegian coast , they are scarce inside dense kelp forests sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the ne atlantic giant kelp can be harvested fairly easily because of its surface canopy and growth habit of staying in deeper water kelp ash is rich in iodine and alkali in great amount , kelp ash can be used in soap and glass production the kelp ash would consist of around 5 % sodium carbonate though the price of kelp ash went into steep decline , seaweed remained the only commercial source of iodine commercial production of kelp harvested from its natural habitat has taken place in japan for over a century giant kelp , macrocystis pyrifera , the largest seaweed america ) laminaria pallida greville ex j agardh ( south africa ) laminaria platymeris ( ne these include : northern kelp crab ( pugettia producta ) and graceful kelp crab ( pugettia gracilis ) , pacific coast of north america , heterosticbus rostratus , genus gibbonsia ) , pacific coast of north america

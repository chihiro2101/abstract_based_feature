in most kelp , the thallus ( or body ) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as blades the holdfast , a root-like structure , anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean gas-filled bladders ( pneumatocysts ) form at the base of blades of american species , such as nereocystis lueteana , ( mert ) to hold the kelp blades close to the surface sea urchins , for example , can reduce entire areas to urchin barrens sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the ne atlantic estuarine , coastal and shelf science 95 : 135-144 the kelp life cycle involves a ploidy sporophyte and haploid gametophyte stage kelp may develop dense forests with high production , abdullah , m.i species distribution and habitat exploitation of fauna associated with kelp ( laminaria hyperborea ) along the norwegian coast colonisation of kelp imitations by epiphyte and holdfast fauna ; a study of mobility patterns more than 100,000 mobile invertebrates per square meter are found on kelp stipes and holdfasts in well-developed kelp forests ( christie et al m√ºller ) are important secondary consumers controlling large barren ground areas on the norwegian coast , they are scarce inside dense kelp forests giant kelp can be harvested fairly easily because of its surface canopy and growth habit of staying in deeper water kelp ash is rich in iodine and alkali the kelp ash would consist of around 5 % sodium carbonate 558 once the leblanc process became commercially viable in britain during the 1820s , common salt replaced kelp ash as raw material for sodium carbonate to supply the new industry in iodine synthesis , kelp ash production continued in some parts of west and north scotland , north west ireland and guernsey iodine was extracted from kelp ash using a lixiviation process 482 , 185-199 as with sodium carbonate however , mineral sources eventually replaced seaweed in iodine production taylor & francis , encyclopaedia of chemical processing and design : volume 27 - hydrogen cyanide to ketones dimethyl ( acetone ) , 1988 , p alginate powder is also used frequently in general dentistry and orthodontics for making impressions of the upper and lower arches 270 kelp polysaccharides are used in skin care as gelling ingredients and because of the benefits provided by fucoidan unlike some biofuels such as corn ethanol , kelp energy avoids '' food vs fuel '' issues and does not require freshwater irrigation archaeological evidence from california 's channel islands confirms that islanders were harvesting kelp forest shellfish and fish , beginning as much as 12,000 years ago giant kelp , macrocystis pyrifera , the largest seaweed ( california - america ) laminaria digitata ( ne america ) other species in the laminariales that may be considered as kelp : alaria esculenta ( north atlantic ) alaria marginata post some animals are named after the kelp , either because they inhabit the same habitat as kelp or because they feed on kelp the kelp highway hypothesis : marine ecology , the coastal migration theory , and the peopling of the americas

he continued his schooling at the gymnasium for six years , and showed interest in philosophy , logic and kant 's work involving the nature of knowledge obtained from experience with reality his education then continued at jena , whereupon he studied philosophy and came to disagree with his teacher fichte precisely because fichte had taught him to think in a logical manner he composed a few essays , which he had given to fichte during his years at jena , criticising the works of schelling and advocating his contention for the german idealism promoted by others like kant at the time leaving jena after three years , he tutored the children of herr von steiger , who was the governor of interlaken while tutoring in switzerland , herbart met and came to know pestalozzi , the swiss educator involved with issues of reform in the schools resigning from his tutoring position , herbart went on to study greek and mathematics at bremen for three years , and then eventually moved on to attend göttingen from 1801 to 1809 here he also established and conducted a seminary of pedagogy till 1833 , when he returned once more to göttingen , and remained there as professor of philosophy till his death herbart gave his last lecture in perfectly good health and then unexpectedly died two days later from apoplexy regardless of his relentless studying , he met an eighteen-year-old english girl named mary drake one night when playing a game of charades they lived a happy life with mary supporting all of her husband 's pursuits and contributions to the fields of pedagogy and psychology philosophy , according to herbart , begins with reflection upon our empirical conceptions , and consists in the reformation and elaboration of these , its three primary divisions being determined by as many distinct forms of elaboration but some conceptions are such that the more distinct they are made the more contradictory their elements become ; so to change and supplement these as to make them at length thinkable is the problem of the second part of philosophy , or metaphysics in herbart 's writings logic receives comparatively meagre notice ; he insisted strongly on its purely formal character and expressed himself in the main at one with kantians such as fries and krug to attempt at this stage a psychological inquiry into the origin of these conceptions would be doubly a mistake ; for we should have to use these illegitimate conceptions in the course of it , and the task of clearing up their contradictions would still remain , whether we succeeded in our enquiry or not we are thus driven to the assumption that the conception is contradictory because incomplete ; but how are we to supplement it ? what we have must point the way to what we want , or our procedure will be arbitrary a mark of the same concept ) as n , while logic denies it ; and so it being impossible for one and the same m to sustain these contradictory positions there is but one way open to us ; we must posit several ms but even now we can not say one of these ms is the same as n , another is not ; for every m must be both thinkable and valid we may , however , take the ms not singly but together ; and again , no other course being open to us , this is what we must do ; we must assume that n results from a combination of ms this is herbart 's method of relations , the counterpart in his system of the hegelian dialectic in ontology , this method is employed to determine what in reality corresponds to the empirical conceptions of substance and cause , or rather of inherence and change the real must be absolutely simple ; for if it contain two determinations , a and b , then either these are reducible to one , which is the true quality , or they are not , when each is conditioned by the other and their position is no longer absolute but there may be a plurality of reals , albeit the mere conception of being can tell us nothing as to this but if so , then a , as a real , being simple , must be equal to a ; similarly it must be b ; and so on where there is the appearance of inherence , therefore , there is always a plurality of reals ; no such correlative to substance as attribute or accident can be admitted at all , then the change from c to d means , not that the central real a or any real has changed , but that a is now in connection with a 4 , etc but to think a number of reals in connection ( zusammensein ) will not suffice as an explanation of phenomena ; something or other must happen when they are in connection ; what is it ? the answer to this question is the second hinge-point of herbart 's theoretical philosophy having thus determined what really is and what actually happens , our philosopher proceeds next to explain synthetically the objective semblance ( der objective schein ) that results from these meanwhile , let us call them intelligible , as being valid for all who comprehend the real and actual by thought , although no such forms are predicable of the real and actual themselves but an investigation of dependent lines which are often incommensurable forces us to adopt the contradictory fiction of partially overlapping , i.e but the contradiction here is one we can not eliminate by the method of relations , because it does not involve anything real ; and in fact as a necessary outcome of an intelligible form , the fiction of continuity is valid for the objective semblance of less intensity than when only two reals are together had the self-preservations been perfect , the coincidence in space would have been complete , and the group of reals would have been inextended ; or had the several reals been simply contiguous , i.e as it is we shall find a continuous molecule manifesting attractive and repulsive forces ; attraction corresponding to the tendency of the self-preservations to become perfect , repulsion to the frustration of this the changes in this motion , however , for which we should require a cause , would be the objective semblance of the self-preservations that actually occur when reals meet here , again , a contradictory conception blocks the way , that , viz but to explain this modification is the business of psychology ; it is enough now to see that the subject like all reals is necessarily unknown and that , therefore , the idealist 's theory of knowledge is unsound the five key ideas which composed his concept of individual maturation were inner freedom , perfection , benevolence , justice and equity or recompense according to herbart , abilities were not innate but could be instilled , so a thorough education could provide the framework for moral and intellectual development reals tend to collide and struggle with one another so much so that each real fights for its own self-preservation ( selbsterhaltung ) it is evident herbart thought that ideas were not precise imitations of the existing items in the world but that they were the direct consequence of the interactions of individuals ’ experiences with the external environment , 1894 ) hauptpunkte der metaphysik ( 1808 ) allgemeine praktische philosophie ( 1808 ) lehrbuch zur einleitung in die philosophie ( 1813 ; new ed hayward , the student 's herbart ( 1902 ) , the critics of herbartianism ( 1903 ) , three historical educators : pestalozzi , fröbel , herbart ( 1905 ) , the secret of herbart ( 1907 ) , the meaning of education as interpreted by herbart ( 1907 ) w

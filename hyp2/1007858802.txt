gwynn jones claimed links between lancelot and eliwlod , a nephew of arthur in the welsh legend proponents of the scythian origins of the arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been alanus-à-lot , that is '' alan of the lot river '' , while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of lancelot in the ancient greek mythical figures of askalos and mopsus ( moxus ) alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 in connection with vinoviloth , the name of a goths chief or tribe mentioned in the getica ( 6th century ) alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' sir lancelot du lake and vinovia '' , the celtic review 9 ( 33 ) : 77–80 other 6th-century figures proposed in modern times as candidates for the prototype of lancelot include the early french saint fraimbault de lassay ; wlanca , a son-in-law of the anglo-saxon king ælle of sussex ; maelgwn , king of gwynedd ; and llaennog ( llaenauc ) , father of gwallog , king of elmet lancelot may have been the hero of a folk tale that was originally independent but was ultimately absorbed into the arthurian tradition goulven péron , '' la légende de lancelot du lac en anjou '' it is also possibly derived from the old french word l'ancelot , meaning '' servant '' ( the hypothesis first put forward by de la villemarqué in 1842 ) ; lancelot 's name is actually written this way in several manuscripts lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) the fact that his name follows gawain and erec indicates the presumed importance of the knight at court , even though he did not figure prominently in chrétien 's tale lancelot reappears in chrétien 's cligès , in which he takes a more important role as one of the knights that cligès must overcome in his quest it is not until chrétien 's poem lancelot , the knight of the cart ( le chevalier de la charrette ) , however , that lancelot becomes the protagonist it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) '' which was later picked up by the french authors of the lancelot-grail and then by thomas malory lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) ulrich asserts that his poem is a translation of an earlier work from an unspecified '' french book '' he had obtained ( written by a certain arnaud daniel ) , the provenance of which is given and which must have differed markedly in several points from chrétien 's story in lanzelet , the abductor of ginover ( guinevere ) is named as king valerin , whose name , unlike that of chrétien 's meliagant , does not appear to derive from the welsh melwas furthermore , ginover 's rescuer is not lanzelet , who instead ends up finding happiness in marriage with the fairy princess iblis if this is true , then the motif of adultery might either have been invented by chrétien for his chevalier de la charrette or have been present in the ( now lost ) source provided to him by his patroness , marie de champagne , a lady well known for her keen interest in matters relating to courtly love arthurian literature in the middle ages : a collaborative history ed lancelot 's character was further developed during the 13th century in the old french prose romance vulgate cycle , where he appears prominently in the later parts , known as the prose lancelot ( or lancelot du lac ) , the queste del saint graal ( the quest for the holy grail ) , and the mort artu ( the death of arthur ) gaston paris argued that the guinevere-meleagant episode of the prose lancelot is an almost literal adaptation of chrétien 's poem , the courtly love theme of which seemed to be forced on the unwilling chrétien by marie , though it can be seen as a considerable amplification the forbidden love affair between lancelot and guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of tristan and iseult , with lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the round table in the later works continuing chrétien 's story lancelot would later become one of the chief knights associated with the holy grail , but chrétien does not include him at all in his final romance , perceval , le conte du graal ( perceval , or the story of the grail ) , the unfinished story that introduced the motif into medieval literature perceval is the sole seeker of the grail in chrétien 's treatment ; lancelot 's involvement in the grail quest is first recorded in the romance perlesvaus , written between 1200 and 1210 in the vulgate cycle , lancelot , birth name galahad ( originally written galaad or galaaz , not to be confused with his own son galahad ) , is born '' in the borderland between gaul and brittany '' as the son of the gallo-roman king ban of benwick ( bénoïc , corresponding to the eastern part of anjou ) , which is overrun by their enemy , claudas as elaine is tending to her dying husband , lancelot is carried off by a fairy enchantress known as the lady of the lake , who then raises the child in her magical realm while elaine becomes a nun his double-cousins lionel and bors the younger , sons of king bors of gaul and elaine of benoic 's sister evaine , are first taken by a knight of claudas and later spirited away to the lady of the lake to become lancelot 's junior companions many of them will also join him at the round table , as do all of those mentioned above , as well as some of their sons , such as elyan the white , and lancelot 's own son , too she and her damsels also continue aiding him in various ways throughout the vulgate lancelot in the vulgate , the white knight later takes the name of his grandfather , king lancelot , upon discovering his identity almost immediately upon his arrival , lancelot and the young queen guinevere fall in love through a strange magical connection between them , and one of his adventures in the prose cycles involves saving her from abduction by arthur 's enemy maleagant the exact timing and sequence of events vary from one source to another , and some details are found only in certain sources the maleagant episode actually marked the end of the original , non-cyclic version of the prose lancelot , telling of only his childhood and early youth , before the later much longer versions in the adventures exclusive to the vulgate lancelot , his further great deeds include slaying multiple dragons and giants he also plays a decisive role in the war against the saxons in lothian ( scotland ) , when he again rescues arthur and gawain ( as he does on different occasions ) and forces the saxon witch-princess camille to surrender '' eventually , lancelot wins his own castle in britain , known as joyous gard ( a former dolorous gard ) , where he learns his real name and heritage faithful to queen guinevere , he refuses the forceful advances of queen morgan le fay , arthur 's enchantress sister the ensuing pregnancy results in the birth of his son galahad , whom elaine will send off to grow up without a father and who later emerges as the merlin-prophesied good knight ultimately , lancelot 's affair with guinevere is a destructive force , which was glorified and justified in the vulgate lancelot but becomes condemned by the time of the vulgate queste wyeth - p38.jpg facing turquine : '' i am sir launcelot du lake , king ban 's son of benwick he is portrayed as an awkward knight prone to sudden and uncontrolled outbursts of violence in the section '' sir lancelot the brave '' that shows his misguided bloody rampage to save a princess who turns out to be a prince and who did not really need to be rescued this version of lancelot is presented as a self-serving , narcissistic and cowardly prince of the lost kingdom of benoic , left by him to be destroyed by franks barbarians lancelot is featured in nakaba suzuki 's the seven deadly sins , where he is the son of ban and the fairy queen elaine

gwynn jones claimed links between lancelot and eliwlod , a nephew of arthur in the welsh legend alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' sir lancelot du lake and vinovia '' , the celtic review 9 ( 33 ) : 77–80 as for his name , '' lancelot '' may be a variant of the common name '' lancelin '' ( as proposed by gaston paris in 1881 , later supported by rachel bromwich ) lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) lancelot reappears in chrétien 's cligès , in which he takes a more important role as one of the knights that cligès must overcome in his quest it is not until chrétien 's poem lancelot , the knight of the cart ( le chevalier de la charrette ) , however , that lancelot becomes the protagonist it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) page 13 : '' strictly speaking , the name lancelot du lac ( '' lancelot of the lake '' ) first appears in chrétien 's arthurian debut , erec and enide ( line 1674 ) , as a member of the roundtable '' chrétien treats lancelot as if his audience were already familiar with the character 's background , yet most of the characteristics and exploits that are commonly associated with lancelot today are first mentioned here in the words of matilda bruckner , '' what existed before chrétien remains uncertain , but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably linked to his love for arthur 's queen lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) in lanzelet , the abductor of ginover ( guinevere ) is named as king valerin , whose name , unlike that of chrétien 's meliagant , does not appear to derive from the welsh melwas instead , the hero of ulrich 's book is arthur 's nephew , the son of arthur 's sister queen clarine . evolution of the legend lancelot 's character was further developed during the 13th century in the old french prose romance vulgate cycle , where he appears prominently in the later parts , known as the prose lancelot ( or lancelot du lac ) , the queste del saint graal ( the quest for the holy grail ) , and the mort artu ( the death of arthur ) when chrétien de troyes wrote at the request of countess marie , she was only interested in the romantic relationship between lancelot and the queen however , the lancelot in prose greatly expands the story : he is assigned a family , a descent from lost kingdom , and many further adventures much of the prose lancelot material from the vulgate cycle has been later removed in the rewriting known as the post-vulgate cycle , with the surviving parts being reworked and attached to the other parts of this cycle the forbidden love affair between lancelot and guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of tristan and iseult , with lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the round table in the later works continuing chrétien 's story lancelot would later become one of the chief knights associated with the holy grail , but chrétien does not include him at all in his final romance , perceval , le conte du graal ( perceval , or the story of the grail ) , the unfinished story that introduced the motif into medieval literature perceval is the sole seeker of the grail in chrétien 's treatment ; lancelot 's involvement in the grail quest is first recorded in the romance perlesvaus , written between 1200 and 1210 1320 ) contains seven arthurian romances , including a new lancelot one , folded into the three parts of the cycle in this story , '' lanceloet en het hert met het witte voet '' ( '' lancelot and the hart with the white foot '' ) , lancelot fights seven lions to get the white foot from a hart ( deer ) which will allow him to marry a princess near the end of the 15th century , malory 's le morte d'arthur followed the lancelot-grail cycle in presenting lancelot as the best knight , a departure from the preceding english tradition in which gawain had been the most prominent '' ‘ now i take uppon me the adventures to seke of holy thynges ’ : lancelot and the crisis of arthurian knighthood ) after three years pass in human world , the child lancelot grows up and matures much faster than he would naturally do , and it is from this upbringing that he earns the name du lacof the lake his double-cousins lionel and bors the younger , sons of king bors of gaul and elaine of benoic 's sister evaine , are first taken by a knight of claudas and later spirited away to the lady of the lake to become lancelot 's junior companions lancelot–grail : the old french arthurian vulgate and post-vulgate in translation , volume 3 of 5 lancelot 's other notable surviving kinsmen often include bleoberis and hector de maris among other and usually more distant relatives diverging on lancelot 's personality , the narration then adds the first mention of his berserker-like mental instability ( not seen in chrétien 's version ) : she and her damsels also continue aiding him in various ways throughout the vulgate lancelot he eventually is made a member of arthur 's elite round table after releasing the king 's nephew gawain from enemy captivity the maleagant episode actually marked the end of the original , non-cyclic version of the prose lancelot , telling of only his childhood and early youth , before the later much longer versions he also plays a decisive role in the war against the saxons in lothian ( scotland ) , when he again rescues arthur and gawain ( as he does on different occasions ) and forces the saxon witch-princess camille to surrender at one point , he goes mad when he is led to believe that guinevere doubts his love until he is found and healed by the lady of the lake another instance of lancelot temporarily losing his mind occurs during his brief imprisonment by camille , after which he is cured by the lady as well he also may harbor a darker , more violent side that is usually suppressed by the chivalric code but can become easily unleashed during the moments of action in the prose tristan and its adaptations , including the account within the post-vulgate queste , lancelot harbors the fugitive lovers tristan and iseult as they flee from the evil king mark of cornwall this condition causes lancelot to go half-mad , and galehaut to fall sick out of longing for him and eventually to die of anguish after he receives a false rumour of lancelot 's suicide lancelot also saves the queen from an accusation of murder by poison when he fights as her champion against mador de la porte upon his timely return in another episode included in malory 's version after the queen 's death , lancelot and his fellow knights escort her body to be interred beside king arthur ( in the same place where gawain 's skull is kept ) wyeth - p52.jpg '' lancelot ever ran wild wood from place to place '' file : boys king arthur - n this version of lancelot is presented as a self-serving , narcissistic and cowardly prince of the lost kingdom of benoic , left by him to be destroyed by franks barbarians lancelot at the camelot project an english translation of the prose lancelot at the internet archive lancelot digital exposition at the bibliothèque nationale de france

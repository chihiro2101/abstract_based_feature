gwynn jones claimed links between lancelot and eliwlod , a nephew of arthur in the welsh legend proponents of the scythian origins of the arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been alanus-à-lot , that is '' alan of the lot river '' , while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of lancelot in the ancient greek mythical figures of askalos and mopsus ( moxus ) alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' sir lancelot du lake and vinovia '' , the celtic review 9 ( 33 ) : 77–80 goulven péron , '' la légende de lancelot du lac en anjou '' it is also possibly derived from the old french word l'ancelot , meaning '' servant '' ( the hypothesis first put forward by de la villemarqué in 1842 ) ; lancelot 's name is actually written this way in several manuscripts lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) it is not until chrétien 's poem lancelot , the knight of the cart ( le chevalier de la charrette ) , however , that lancelot becomes the protagonist it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) page 13 : '' strictly speaking , the name lancelot du lac ( '' lancelot of the lake '' ) first appears in chrétien 's arthurian debut , erec and enide ( line 1674 ) , as a member of the roundtable 170 : '' this is the book of my lord lancelot du lac in which all his deeds and chivalric conduct are contained and the coming of the holy grail and his quest ( which was ) made and achieved by the good knights , galahad '' chrétien treats lancelot as if his audience were already familiar with the character 's background , yet most of the characteristics and exploits that are commonly associated with lancelot today are first mentioned here the story centers on lancelot 's rescue of queen guinevere after she has been abducted by maleagant in the words of matilda bruckner , '' what existed before chrétien remains uncertain , but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably linked to his love for arthur 's queen lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) ulrich asserts that his poem is a translation of an earlier work from an unspecified '' french book '' he had obtained ( written by a certain arnaud daniel ) , the provenance of which is given and which must have differed markedly in several points from chrétien 's story in lanzelet , the abductor of ginover ( guinevere ) is named as king valerin , whose name , unlike that of chrétien 's meliagant , does not appear to derive from the welsh melwas furthermore , ginover 's rescuer is not lanzelet , who instead ends up finding happiness in marriage with the fairy princess iblis similar to chrétien 's version , lanzelet too is raised by a water fairy ( here the queen of the maidenland ) , having lost his father king pant of genewis to a rebellion 436–39 in essay 33 hartmann von aue and his successors by hendricus spaarnay much of the prose lancelot material from the vulgate cycle has been later removed in the rewriting known as the post-vulgate cycle , with the surviving parts being reworked and attached to the other parts of this cycle lancelot is often tied to the christian themes within arthurian legend lancelot 's quest for guinevere in lancelot , the knight of the cart is similar to christ 's quest for the human soul this new formulation of a lancelot romance in the netherlands indicates the character 's widespread popularity even prior to the lancelot-grail story near the end of the 15th century , malory 's le morte d'arthur followed the lancelot-grail cycle in presenting lancelot as the best knight , a departure from the preceding english tradition in which gawain had been the most prominent as elaine is tending to her dying husband , lancelot is carried off by a fairy enchantress known as the lady of the lake , who then raises the child in her magical realm while elaine becomes a nun ( in an alternate version from the italian la tavola ritonda , lancelot is born when the late ban 's wife gostanza delivers him two months early and soon after also dies ;

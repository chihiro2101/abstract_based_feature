gwynn jones claimed links between lancelot and eliwlod , a nephew of arthur in the welsh legend proponents of the scythian origins of the arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been alanus-à-lot , that is '' alan of the lot river '' , while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of lancelot in the ancient greek mythical figures of askalos and mopsus ( moxus ) alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 other 6th-century figures proposed in modern times as candidates for the prototype of lancelot include the early french saint fraimbault de lassay ; wlanca , a son-in-law of the anglo-saxon king ælle of sussex ; maelgwn , king of gwynedd ; and llaennog ( llaenauc ) , father of gwallog , king of elmet lancelot may have been the hero of a folk tale that was originally independent but was ultimately absorbed into the arthurian tradition goulven péron , '' la légende de lancelot du lac en anjou '' it is also possibly derived from the old french word l'ancelot , meaning '' servant '' ( the hypothesis first put forward by de la villemarqué in 1842 ) ; lancelot 's name is actually written this way in several manuscripts lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) the fact that his name follows gawain and erec indicates the presumed importance of the knight at court , even though he did not figure prominently in chrétien 's tale it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) page 13 : '' strictly speaking , the name lancelot du lac ( '' lancelot of the lake '' ) first appears in chrétien 's arthurian debut , erec and enide ( line 1674 ) , as a member of the roundtable elizabeth archibald , anthony stockwell garfield edwards , a companion to malory ( 1996 ) 170 : '' this is the book of my lord lancelot du lac in which all his deeds and chivalric conduct are contained and the coming of the holy grail and his quest ( which was ) made and achieved by the good knights , galahad lancelot 's passion for arthur 's wife guinevere is entirely absent from another early work , lanzelet , a middle high german epic poem by ulrich von zatzikhoven dating from the very end of the 12th century ( no earlier than 1194 ) it has been suggested that lancelot was originally the hero of a story independent of the adulterous love triangle and perhaps very similar to ulrich 's version gaston paris argued that the guinevere-meleagant episode of the prose lancelot is an almost literal adaptation of chrétien 's poem , the courtly love theme of which seemed to be forced on the unwilling chrétien by marie , though it can be seen as a considerable amplification much of the prose lancelot material from the vulgate cycle has been later removed in the rewriting known as the post-vulgate cycle , with the surviving parts being reworked and attached to the other parts of this cycle the forbidden love affair between lancelot and guinevere can be seen as a parallel to that of tristan and iseult , with lancelot ultimately being identified with the tragedy of chance and human failing that is responsible for the downfall of the round table in the later works continuing chrétien 's story lancelot 's quest for guinevere in lancelot , the knight of the cart is similar to christ 's quest for the human soul 1320 ) contains seven arthurian romances , including a new lancelot one , folded into the three parts of the cycle this new formulation of a lancelot romance in the netherlands indicates the character 's widespread popularity even prior to the lancelot-grail story near the end of the 15th century , malory 's le morte d'arthur followed the lancelot-grail cycle in presenting lancelot as the best knight , a departure from the preceding english tradition in which gawain had been the most prominent ( in an alternate version from the italian la tavola ritonda , lancelot is born when the late ban 's wife gostanza delivers him two months early and soon after also dies ; here , the lady of the lake 's only relation to lancelot is briefly abducting him as an adult ) after three years pass in human world , the child lancelot grows up and matures much faster than he would naturally do , and it is from this upbringing that he earns the name du lacof the lake his double-cousins lionel and bors the younger , sons of king bors of gaul and elaine of benoic 's sister evaine , are first taken by a knight of claudas and later spirited away to the lady of the lake to become lancelot 's junior companions many of them will also join him at the round table , as do all of those mentioned above , as well as some of their sons , such as elyan the white , and lancelot 's own son , too in the prose lancelot , the minor knights of the round table also mentioned as related to lancelot in one way or another are aban , acantan the agile , banin , blamor , brandinor , crinides the black , danubre the brave , gadran , hebes the famous , lelas , ocursus the black , pincados , tanri , and more ( they are different and fewer in malory ) diverging on lancelot 's personality , the narration then adds the first mention of his berserker-like mental instability ( not seen in chrétien 's version ) : initially known only as the nameless white knight ( blanc chevalier ) , clad in silver steel on a white horse , the young lancelot ( claiming to be 18 years old , although it later revealed how he is really only 15 ) arrives in arthur 's kingdom of logres with the lady of the lake to be knighted by the king at her behest the lady gives him a powerful magic ring able to dispel any enchantment ( as his anonymous fairy foster mother also does in chrétien 's version ; later parts of the vulgate lancelot instead retcon this as given to him by guinevere ) , among other enchanted items with various abilities ( including a lance and a sword , a tent , and a mirror ) in the vulgate , the white knight later takes the name of his grandfather , king lancelot , upon discovering his identity he eventually is made a member of arthur 's elite round table after releasing the king 's nephew gawain from enemy captivity almost immediately upon his arrival , lancelot and the young queen guinevere fall in love through a strange magical connection between them , and one of his adventures in the prose cycles involves saving her from abduction by arthur 's enemy maleagant he also plays a decisive role in the war against the saxons in lothian ( scotland ) , when he again rescues arthur and gawain ( as he does on different occasions ) and forces the saxon witch-princess camille to surrender another instance of lancelot temporarily losing his mind occurs during his brief imprisonment by camille , after which he is cured by the lady as well nevertheless , the vulgate lancelot notes that '' for all the knights in the world he was the one most unwilling to hurt any lady or maiden '' eventually , lancelot wins his own castle in britain , known as joyous gard ( a former dolorous gard ) , where he learns his real name and heritage at first , lancelot continues to serve galehaut in his home country of sorelois , where guinevere joins him after lancelot saves her from the bewitched arthur during the '' gwenhwyfach '' episode faithful to queen guinevere , he refuses the forceful advances of queen morgan le fay , arthur 's enchantress sister on one occasion ( as told in the prose lancelot ) , morgan agrees to let lancelot go save gawain if he will return to her immediately afterwards , and then sets him free under the condition that he will not spend any time with either guinevere or galehaut for a year following further adventures , during which he experiences defeat and humiliation , lancelot himself is allowed only a glimpse of the grail because he is an adultery and was distracted from faith in god by earthly honours that came through his knightly prowess the eventual result of this is the betrayal of arthur by mordred , the king 's bastard son ( and formerly one of lancelot 's young followers ) , who falsely announces arthur 's death to seize the throne for himself upon receiving a desperate letter from the dying gawain offering him forgiveness and asking for his help in the fight against mordred , lancelot hurries to return to britain with his army , only to hear the news of arthur 's death at salisbury plain ( romance version of the battle of camlann ) after the queen 's death , lancelot and his fellow knights escort her body to be interred beside king arthur ( in the same place where gawain 's skull is kept ) lancelot at the camelot project an english translation of the prose lancelot at the internet archive lancelot digital exposition at the bibliothèque nationale de france

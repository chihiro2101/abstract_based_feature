gwynn jones claimed links between lancelot and eliwlod , a nephew of arthur in the welsh legend proponents of the scythian origins of the arthurian legend have speculated that an early form might have been alanus-à-lot , that is '' alan of the lot river '' , while those looking for clues in antiquity see elements of lancelot in the ancient greek mythical figures of askalos and mopsus ( moxus ) alfred anscombe proposed in 1913 that the name '' lancelot '' came from germanic wlancloth , with roots in the old english wlenceo ( pride ) and loða ( cloak ) , alfred anscombe ( 1913 ) , '' the name of sir lancelot du lake '' , the celtic review 8 ( 32 ) : 365–366 as for his name , '' lancelot '' may be a variant of the common name '' lancelin '' ( as proposed by gaston paris in 1881 , later supported by rachel bromwich ) goulven péron , '' la légende de lancelot du lac en anjou '' it is also possibly derived from the old french word l'ancelot , meaning '' servant '' ( the hypothesis first put forward by de la villemarqué in 1842 ) ; lancelot 's name is actually written this way in several manuscripts lancelot 's name appears third on a list of knights at king arthur 's court in the earliest known work featuring him as a character : chrétien de troyes ' erec and enide ( 1170 ) it is not until chrétien 's poem lancelot , the knight of the cart ( le chevalier de la charrette ) , however , that lancelot becomes the protagonist it is also chrétien who first gives lancelot the name lancelot du lac ( lancelot of the lake ) , william farina , chretien de troyes and the dawn of arthurian romance ( 2010 ) page 13 : '' strictly speaking , the name lancelot du lac ( '' lancelot of the lake '' ) first appears in chrétien 's arthurian debut , erec and enide ( line 1674 ) , as a member of the roundtable in the words of matilda bruckner , '' what existed before chrétien remains uncertain , but there is no doubt that his version became the starting point for all subsequent tales of lancelot as the knight whose extraordinary prowess is inextricably linked to his love for arthur 's queen in lanzelet , the abductor of ginover ( guinevere ) is named as king valerin , whose name , unlike that of chrétien 's meliagant , does not appear to derive from the welsh melwas furthermore , ginover 's rescuer is not lanzelet , who instead ends up finding happiness in marriage with the fairy princess iblis it has been suggested that lancelot was originally the hero of a story independent of the adulterous love triangle and perhaps very similar to ulrich 's version lancelot 's character was further developed during the 13th century in the old french prose romance vulgate cycle , where he appears prominently in the later parts , known as the prose lancelot ( or lancelot du lac ) , the queste del saint graal ( the quest for the holy grail ) , and the mort artu ( the death of arthur ) when chrétien de troyes wrote at the request of countess marie , she was only interested in the romantic relationship between lancelot and the queen however , the lancelot in prose greatly expands the story : he is assigned a family , a descent from lost kingdom , and many further adventures much of the prose lancelot material from the vulgate cycle has been later removed in the rewriting known as the post-vulgate cycle , with the surviving parts being reworked and attached to the other parts of this cycle lancelot 's quest for guinevere in lancelot , the knight of the cart is similar to christ 's quest for the human soul his adventure among the tombs is described in terms that suggest christ 's harrowing of hell and resurrection ; he effortlessly lifts the lid off the sarcophagus , which bears an inscription foretelling his freeing of the captives '' ‘ now i take uppon me the adventures to seke of holy thynges ’ : lancelot and the crisis of arthurian knighthood ban and his wife queen elaine ( élaine , sometimes elainne or helainne ) flee the destruction of their final stronghold , carrying the infant child with them ) after three years pass in human world , the child lancelot grows up and matures much faster than he would naturally do , and it is from this upbringing that he earns the name du lacof the lake lancelot–grail : the old french arthurian vulgate and post-vulgate in translation , volume 3 of 5 many of them will also join him at the round table , as do all of those mentioned above , as well as some of their sons , such as elyan the white , and lancelot 's own son , too an early part of the vulgate lancelot also describes in a great detail what made him ( in a translation by norris j diverging on lancelot 's personality , the narration then adds the first mention of his berserker-like mental instability ( not seen in chrétien 's version ) : in the vulgate , the white knight later takes the name of his grandfather , king lancelot , upon discovering his identity in the post-vulgate , where lancelot is no longer the central protagonist , he instead comes to arthur 's court alone and almost defeats the king himself on their first meeting without knowing his identity ( excalibur , meant to be used only for the sake of the kingdom and justice , may be broken either in this fight or the one against king pellinore ) almost immediately upon his arrival , lancelot and the young queen guinevere fall in love through a strange magical connection between them , and one of his adventures in the prose cycles involves saving her from abduction by arthur 's enemy maleagant in the adventures exclusive to the vulgate lancelot , his further great deeds include slaying multiple dragons and giants lancelot dedicates his deeds to his lady guinevere , acting in her name as her knight at one point , he goes mad when he is led to believe that guinevere doubts his love until he is found and healed by the lady of the lake he also may harbor a darker , more violent side that is usually suppressed by the chivalric code but can become easily unleashed during the moments of action nevertheless , the vulgate lancelot notes that '' for all the knights in the world he was the one most unwilling to hurt any lady or maiden with the help of king arthur , lancelot then defeats claudas ( and his allied romans in the vulgate ) and recovers his father 's kingdom lancelot , incognito as the black knight bruce , the arthurian name dictionary , p lancelot accepts and uses his boon to demand that galehaut surrender peacefully to arthur at first , lancelot continues to serve galehaut in his home country of sorelois , where guinevere joins him after lancelot saves her from the bewitched arthur during the '' gwenhwyfach '' episode lancelot , shown the holy grail through a veil , is cured of his madness , and then chooses to live with her on a remote isle where he is known incognito as the wicked knight ( chevalier malfait , the form also used by malory ) there is no war with the sons of mordred in the version included in le morte d'arthur file : irht 305652 2 p.jpg '' how lancelot fought the six knights of chastel d'uter to save the brunor lancelot appeared as a character in many arthurian films and television productions , sometimes even as the protagonistic titular character a handsome and great warrior , he is the protagonist morgaine 's cousin and first love interest , himself being bisexual and loving both guinevere and arthur lancelot at the camelot project an english translation of the prose lancelot at the internet archive lancelot digital exposition at the bibliothèque nationale de france

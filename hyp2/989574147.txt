state diagrams are used to give an abstract description of the behavior of a system this behavior is analyzed and represented by a series of events that can occur in one or more possible states hereby '' each diagram usually represents objects of a single class and track the different states of its objects through the system '' state diagrams can be used to graphically represent finite-state machines ( also called finite automata ) an edge is usually drawn as an arrow directed from the present state to the next state this mapping describes the state transition that is to occur on input of a particular symbol item δ ( q , a ) p in the definition of the fa means that from the state named q under input symbol a , the transition to the state p occurs in this machine the start state q 0 ∈ q is usually represented by an arrow with no origin pointing to the state mcclusky , introduction to the theory of switching circuits , mcgraw-hill , 1965 the start state is not shown and must be inferred from the text sometimes the accept state ( s ) function as '' final '' ( halt , trapped ) states for a moore machine the state 's output is usually written inside the state 's circle , also separated from the state 's designator with a slash '' / '' s 1 and s 2 are states and s 1 is an accepting state or a final state the diagram type allows the modeling of superstates , orthogonal regions , and activities as part of a state classic state diagrams require the creation of distinct nodes for every valid combination of parameters that define the state this can lead to a very large number of nodes and transitions between nodes for all but the simplest of systems ( state and transition explosion ) the current state of each cross-functional state machine in the statechart defines the state of the system the figure below shows a comparison of a state diagram with a flowchart however , if the state includes variables , then if those change value , we can be at the same program location with different variable values , meaning in a different state in the program 's state space the figure above attempts to show that reversal of roles by aligning the arcs of the state diagrams with the processing stages of the flowchart an interesting extension is to allow arcs to flow from any number of states to any number of states

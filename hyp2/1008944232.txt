electromechanical solenoids consist of an electromagnetic induction coil , wound around a movable steel or iron slug ( termed the armature ) the coil is shaped such that the armature can be moved in and out of the space in the center of the coil , altering the coil 's inductance and thereby becoming an electromagnet the force applied to the armature is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil with respect to the change in position of the armature and the current flowing through the coil ( see faraday 's law of induction ) the force applied to the armature will always move the armature in a direction that increases the coil 's inductance included in this category of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature as a function of coil current these solenoids , whether axial or rotary , employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force ( torque ) , and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically because of the increased flux level a rise in ampere-turns drops elsewhere in the ferrous circuit ( predominately in the pole geometry ) causes the reduction of air gap ampere-turns and , therefore , the reduced potential energy of the field at the air gap further incrementing of the plunger causes a continuing decrease of the solenoid force thus creating an ideal condition for motion control as controlled by the current to the solenoid coil the rotary solenoid has a similar appearance to a linear solenoid , except that the armature core is mounted in the center of a large flat disk , with three inclined raceways coined into the underside of the disk when the solenoid is activated , the armature core is magnetically attracted toward the stator pole , and the disk rotates on the ball bearings in the races as it moves towards the coil body typically the fixed magnet is on the outside , and the coil part moves in an arc controlled by the current flow through the coils solenoid valve are in general similar to pneumatic solenoid valves except that they control the flow of hydraulic fluid ( oil ) , often at around 3000 psi ( 210 bar , 21 mpa , 21 mn/m 2 ) interactive java tutorial : magnetic field of a solenoid , national high magnetic field laboratory discussion of solenoids at hyperphysics solenoid basics for robotics basics of rotary voice coils what is a solenoid how a dc solenoid works

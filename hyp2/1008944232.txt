the coil is shaped such that the armature can be moved in and out of the space in the center of the coil , altering the coil 's inductance and thereby becoming an electromagnet the force applied to the armature is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil with respect to the change in position of the armature and the current flowing through the coil ( see faraday 's law of induction ) the force applied to the armature will always move the armature in a direction that increases the coil 's inductance included in this category of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature as a function of coil current these solenoids , whether axial or rotary , employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force ( torque ) , and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically focusing of the magnetic field and its attendant flux metering , as illustrated in the sae paper , is required to produce a high starting force at the start of the solenoid stroke and to maintain a level or declining force as the solenoid moves through its displacement range the focusing of the magnetic field to the working air gap initially produces a high mmf ( ampere turns ) and relatively low flux level across the air gap this high product of mmf x flux ( read energy ) produces a high starting force further incrementing of the plunger causes a continuing decrease of the solenoid force thus creating an ideal condition for motion control as controlled by the current to the solenoid coil the working part of a galvanometer is also a type of rotary voice coil that pivots around the pointer axis , a hairspring is usually used to provide a weak nearly linear restoring force solenoid valve are in general similar to pneumatic solenoid valves except that they control the flow of hydraulic fluid ( oil ) , often at around 3000 psi ( 210 bar , 21 mpa , 21 mn/m 2 ) the starter solenoid receives a large electric current from the car battery and a small electric current from the ignition switch interactive java tutorial : magnetic field of a solenoid , national high magnetic field laboratory discussion of solenoids at hyperphysics solenoid basics for robotics basics of rotary voice coils what is a solenoid how a dc solenoid works

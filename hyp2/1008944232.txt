the movement of the armature is used to provide a mechanical force to some mechanism , such as controlling a pneumatic valve the force applied to the armature is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil with respect to the change in position of the armature and the current flowing through the coil ( see faraday 's law of induction ) the force applied to the armature will always move the armature in a direction that increases the coil 's inductance included in this category of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature as a function of coil current these solenoids , whether axial or rotary , employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force ( torque ) , and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically focusing of the magnetic field and its attendant flux metering , as illustrated in the sae paper , is required to produce a high starting force at the start of the solenoid stroke and to maintain a level or declining force as the solenoid moves through its displacement range the focusing of the magnetic field to the working air gap initially produces a high mmf ( ampere turns ) and relatively low flux level across the air gap inherent with the plunger increment of motion , the air gap permeance increases slightly , the magnetic flux increases , the mmf across the air gap decreases slightly ; all of which results in maintaining a high product of mmf x flux further incrementing of the plunger causes a continuing decrease of the solenoid force thus creating an ideal condition for motion control as controlled by the current to the solenoid coil the rotary solenoid is an electromechanical device used to rotate a ratcheting mechanism when power is applied the rotary solenoid has a similar appearance to a linear solenoid , except that the armature core is mounted in the center of a large flat disk , with three inclined raceways coined into the underside of the disk the starter solenoid receives a large electric current from the car battery and a small electric current from the ignition switch interactive java tutorial : magnetic field of a solenoid , national high magnetic field laboratory discussion of solenoids at hyperphysics solenoid basics for robotics basics of rotary voice coils what is a solenoid how a dc solenoid works

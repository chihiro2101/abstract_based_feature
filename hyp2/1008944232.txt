the coil is shaped such that the armature can be moved in and out of the space in the center of the coil , altering the coil 's inductance and thereby becoming an electromagnet the force applied to the armature is proportional to the change in inductance of the coil with respect to the change in position of the armature and the current flowing through the coil ( see faraday 's law of induction ) included in this category of solenoids are the uniquely designed magnetic circuits that effect analog positioning of the solenoid plunger or armature as a function of coil current these solenoids , whether axial or rotary , employ a flux carrying geometry that both produces a high starting force ( torque ) , and has a section that quickly begins to saturate magnetically a uni-directional solenoid would actuate against an opposing force or a dual solenoid system would be self cycling the focusing of the magnetic field to the working air gap initially produces a high mmf ( ampere turns ) and relatively low flux level across the air gap this high product of mmf x flux ( read energy ) produces a high starting force inherent with the plunger increment of motion , the air gap permeance increases slightly , the magnetic flux increases , the mmf across the air gap decreases slightly ; all of which results in maintaining a high product of mmf x flux further incrementing of the plunger causes a continuing decrease of the solenoid force thus creating an ideal condition for motion control as controlled by the current to the solenoid coil the rotary solenoid is an electromechanical device used to rotate a ratcheting mechanism when power is applied the rotary solenoid has a similar appearance to a linear solenoid , except that the armature core is mounted in the center of a large flat disk , with three inclined raceways coined into the underside of the disk a rotary voice coil is a rotational version of a solenoid interactive java tutorial : magnetic field of a solenoid , national high magnetic field laboratory discussion of solenoids at hyperphysics solenoid basics for robotics basics of rotary voice coils what is a solenoid how a dc solenoid works

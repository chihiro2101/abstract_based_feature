the first king of the old kingdom was djoser ( sometime between 2691 and 2625 bc ) of the third dynasty , who ordered the construction of a pyramid ( the step pyramid ) in memphis ' necropolis , saqqara it was in this era that formerly independent ancient egyptian states became known as nomes , under the rule of the king egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe worked in cycles , and the pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles the old kingdom and its royal power reached a zenith under the fourth dynasty ( 2613–2494 bc ) , which began with sneferu ( 2613–2589 bc ) after djoser , pharaoh sneferu was the next great pyramid builder using more stones than any other pharaoh , he built the three pyramids : a now collapsed pyramid in meidum , the bent pyramid at dahshur , and the red pyramid , at north dahshur sneferu was succeeded by his son , khufu ( 2589–2566 bc ) , who built the great pyramid of giza after khufu 's death , his sons djedefre ( 2566–2558 bc ) and khafre ( 2558–2532 bc ) may have quarrelled the latter built the second pyramid and ( in traditional thinking ) the great sphinx of giza recent re-examination of evidence has led egyptologist vassil dobrev to propose that the sphinx had been built by djedefra as a monument to his father khufu the later kings of the fourth dynasty were king menkaure ( 2532–2504 bc ) , who built the smallest pyramid in giza , shepseskaf ( 2504–2498 bc ) and , perhaps , djedefptah ( 2498–2496 bc ) the fifth dynasty ( 2494–2345 bc ) began with userkaf ( 2494–2487 bc ) and was marked by the growing importance of the cult of sun god ra consequently , fewer efforts were devoted to the construction of pyramid complexes than during the fourth dynasty and more to the construction of sun temples in abusir userkaf was succeeded by his son sahure ( 2487–2475 bc ) , who commanded an expedition to punt sahure was in turn succeeded by neferirkare kakai ( 2475–2455 bc ) , who was sahure 's son he was followed by two short-lived kings , his son neferefre ( 2455–2453 & nbsp ; bc ) and shepseskare , the latter of uncertain parentage however , nile flood control was still the subject of very large works , including especially the canal to lake moeris around 2300 bc , which was likely also the source of water to the giza pyramid complex centuries earlier internal disorders set in during the incredibly long reign of pepi ii ( 2278–2184 bc ) towards the end of the dynasty an important inscription on the tomb of ankhtifi , a nomarch during the early first intermediate period , describes the pitiful state of the country when famine stalked the land the guide lines developed in the old kingdom and the later grid system developed in the middle kingdom ensured that art was axial , symmetrical , proportional , and most importantly reproducible and therefore recognizable though egyptian art almost always includes descriptive text , literacy rates were not high , so the art gave another method for communicating the same information the old kingdom was considered a golden age for egypt , a grandiose height to which all future kingdoms aspired black was associated with egypt due to the color of the soil after the nile flood , green with vegetation and rebirth , red with the sun and its regenerative cycle , and white with purity egypt in the old kingdom : an introduction in the shadow of the pyramids : ancient egypt during the old kingdom the fall of the egyptian old kingdom from bbc history middle east on the matrix : egypt , the old kingdom – photographs of many of the historic sites dating from the old kingdom old kingdom of egypt- aldokkan

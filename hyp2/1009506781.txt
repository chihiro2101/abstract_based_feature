lowry had already published one novel , ultramarine ( 1933 ) , by the time he was working on under the volcano , and in 1936 wrote a short story called '' under the volcano '' containing the kernel of the future novel that story was not published until the 1960s ; passages of it are found also in the account of sigbjorn wilderness , found in dark as the grave wherein my friend is laid , edited by margerie bonner ( lowry 's second wife ) and published in 1968 it contains what conrad aiken would later call '' the horse theme , '' so important in under the volcano the story includes the horse branded with the number seven , the dying indian encountered while on a bus trip , the pelado who steals the indian 's money to pay his bus fare , and the inability of the spectator ( wilderness in the short story , the consul in the novel ) to act the first version of the novel was developed while lowry lived in mexico , frequently drunk and out of control while his first marriage was breaking up in 1940 , lowry hired an agent , harold matson , to find a publisher for the manuscript but found nothing but rejection—this manuscript is referred to by scholars as the 1940 version , and differs in details of various significance from the published version between 1940 and 1944 , lowry revised the novel ( with significant editorial assistance from margerie bonner ) , a process which occupied him completely : during those years lowry , who had been wont to work on many projects at the same time , worked on nothing but the manuscript , asals 1–3 by 1940 , she was his unfaithful wife , and in that version ( and a 1941 revision ) chapter 11 ended with her and hugh making love margerie bonner rescued the unfinished novel , but all of lowry 's other works in progress were lost in the blaze the burned manuscript was called in ballast to the white sea , and would have been the third book in a trilogy made up of under the volcano , an expanded version of lunar caustic , and in ballast asals notes that the important 1944 revision evidences lowry and bonner paying extraordinary attention to references to fire in the novel , especially in yvonne 's dream before her death in late winter , while travelling in mexico , lowry learned the novel had been accepted by two publishing companies : reynal & hitchcock in the united states and jonathan cape in the united kingdom lowry 's lengthy reply , dated 2 january 1946 , was a passionate defence of the book in which he sensed he had created a work of lasting greatness : '' whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk but there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time in the end , cape published the novel without further revision in 1998 it was rated as number 11 on the list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century compiled by the modern library time included the novel in its list of '' 100 best english-language novels from 1923 to the present , '' calling it a '' vertiginous picture of self-destruction , seen through the eyes of a man still lucid enough to report to us all the harrowing particulars the book consists of twelve chapters , the first of which introduces the narrative proper and which is set exactly a year after the events in contrast with the omniscient narrative mode of the 1940 version , the published novel '' focuses each chapter through the mind of one central figure , no two sequential chapters employing the same character 's consciousness '' the number of chapters was important numerologically , as lowry explained in a letter to johnathan cape : there are twelve hours in a day ( and most of the novel happens in a single day ) , twelve months in a year ( one year elapses between chapter 1 and the end of chapter 12 ) besides , the number 12 is of symbolic importance in the kabbalah which , according to lowry , represents '' man 's spiritual aspirations '' vigil drink anisette at the hotel casino de la selva , on a hill above quauhnahuac ( an approximation of the nahuatl name of cuernavaca ) , and reminisce on the consul 's presence , exactly a year ago afterward laruelle spent

whisky the morning after the red cross ball , when yvonne enters yvonne has returned to try and save their marriage , but the consul appears stuck in the past and begins to talk about his visit to oaxaca , where he went on a drinking binge after yvonne left on the way to their house in the calle nicaragua they stop at jacques laruelle 's '' bizarre '' house , with the inscription no se puede vivir sin amar ( '' one can not live without loving '' ) on the wall , and popocatepetl and ixtaccihuatl come into view the consul tells yvonne that hugh is staying with him as well and is expected back from a trip this very day back at the house , he enters yvonne 's bedroom but their conversation is halted , in part by the temptation of the bottle of johnnie walker he knows is on the patio and in part by hallucinations hugh arrives at his brother 's home and it 's understood that he 's not wearing any of his own clothes hugh ruminates upon his career as sailor , journalist , and musician , while smoking a cigar he imagines himself to be a traitor to his '' journalist friends '' , somehow responsible for the ebro , and comparable to adolf hitler as '' another frustrated artist '' and anti-semite doubting his choice , hugh attempts to escape his journey to sea but is thwarted by the consul , who wires words of support for hugh 's choice to their aunt the two men discuss literature

outside to find vigil , quincey , and bustamente walking together—they do not notice him—just as the bus to tomalin pulls into the station along the way , hugh notices a dead dog at the bottom of the barranca nearby , hugh and the consul spot the recurring horse : '' branded number seven '' the narrative references munro leaf 's ferdinand the bull , as the bull does not care to participate in the

popocatepetl he is in the main barroom of the farolito , which is located at the foot of and seemingly under the volcano popocatepetl the book opens on the last page of doctor faustus , and the four lines laruelle reads are particularly appropriate to the consul : '' cut is the branch that might have grown full straight , it opens with the inquest into lowry 's '' death by misadventure , '' and

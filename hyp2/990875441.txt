taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences this is a multidisciplinary concept and is used in slightly different contexts throughout different fields of study the first stage , disarticulation , occurs as the organism decays and the bones are no longer held together by the flesh and tendons of the organism the final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration ; these are the processes that physically alter the remains ( i.e for example , chemical changes occur at every stage of the process , because of bacteria moreover , most often the organism ( vegetal or animal ) is dead because it has been '' killed '' by a predator taphonomy has undergone an explosion of interest since the 1980s , with research focusing on certain areas the spatio-temporal resolution and ecological fidelity of species assemblages , particularly the relatively minor role of out-of-habitat transport contrasted with the major effects of time-averaging the mars science laboratory mission objectives evolved from assessment of ancient mars habitability to developing predictive models on taphonomy one motivation behind taphonomy is to understand biases present in the fossil record better for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition forensic taphonomy is a relatively new field that has increased in popularity in the past 15 years it is a subfield of forensic anthropology focusing specifically on how taphonomic forces have altered criminal evidence the main factors that affect this branch are categorized into three groups : environmental factors ; external variables , individual factors ; factors from the organism itself ( i.e ) , and cultural factors ; factors specific to any cultural behaviors that would affect the decomposition ( burial practices ) geotaphonomy studies how the burial practices and the burial itself affects the surrounding environment environmental archaeology is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on understanding the past relationships between groups and their environments taphonomy allows specialists to identify what artifacts or remains encountered before and after initial burial zooarchaeology , a focus within environmental archaeology investigates taphonomic processes on animal remains fernandez jalvo , yolanda and peter andrews , “ methods in taphonomy ” in atlas of taphonomic identifications : 1001+ images of fossil and recent mammal bone modification , ed many animals that moult , on the other hand , are overrepresented , as one animal may leave multiple fossils due to its discarded body parts in continental environments , fossilization is especially likely in small lakes that gradually fill in with organic and inorganic material and especially in bog from the time of death or burial until excavation , taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments cambridge : cambridge university press , 1994

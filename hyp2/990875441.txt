taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences fields that employ the concept of taphonomy include : archaeobotany archaeology biology forensic science geoarchaeology geology paleoecology paleontology zooarchaeology there are five main stages of taphonomy : disarticulation , dispersal , accumulation , fossilization , and mechanical alteration the final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration ; these are the processes that physically alter the remains ( i.e '' changes '' begin as soon as the death of the organism : enzymes are released that destroy the organic contents of the tissues , and mineralised tissues such as bone , enamel and dentin are a mixture of organic and mineral components taphonomy has undergone an explosion of interest since the 1980s , with research focusing on certain areas covered within this field is the dominance of biological versus physical agents in the destruction of remains from all major taxonomic groups ( plants , invertebrates , vertebrates ) fossils are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks , yet paleontologys can not draw the most accurate conclusions about the lives and ecology of the fossilized organisms without knowing about the processes involved in their fossilization for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition forensic taphonomy is a relatively new field that has increased in popularity in the past 15 years there are two different branches of forensic taphonomy : biotaphonomy and geotaphonomy the main factors that affect this branch are categorized into three groups : environmental factors ; external variables , individual factors ; factors from the organism itself ( i.e this includes soil disturbances and tool marks from digging the grave , disruption of plant growth and soil ph from the decomposing body , and the alteration of the land and water drainage from introducing an unnatural mass to the area taphonomy allows specialists to identify what artifacts or remains encountered before and after initial burial zooarchaeology , a focus within environmental archaeology investigates taphonomic processes on animal remains when there is little to no written record , taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants any factor that affects the likelihood that an organism is preserved as a fossil is a potential source of bias it is thus arguably the most important goal of taphonomy to identify the scope of such biases such that they can be quantified to allow correct interpretations of the relative abundances of organisms that make up a fossil biota first and foremost , organisms that biomineralization have a far greater chance of being represented in the fossil record than organisms consisting of soft tissue only soft-bodied organisms may form 30 % to 100 % of the biota , but most fossil assemblages preserve none of this unseen diversity , which may exclude groups such as fungi and entire animal phyla from the fossil record many animals that moult , on the other hand , are overrepresented , as one animal may leave multiple fossils due to its discarded body parts a fossil deposit may thus become biased towards exotic species ( i.e taxonomic bias : fossils with easily discernible morphologies will be easy to distinguish as separate species , and will thus have an inflated abundance from the time of death or burial until excavation , taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments often these findings can be used to better understand cultural or environmental shifts within the present day

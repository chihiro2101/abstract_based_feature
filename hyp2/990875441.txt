taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences the first stage , disarticulation , occurs as the organism decays and the bones are no longer held together by the flesh and tendons of the organism the final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration ; these are the processes that physically alter the remains ( i.e moreover , most often the organism ( vegetal or animal ) is dead because it has been '' killed '' by a predator microbe , biogeochemical , and larger-scale controls on the preservation of different tissue types ; in particular , exceptional preservation in lagerstätte one motivation behind taphonomy is to understand biases present in the fossil record better during the late twentieth century , taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as paleobiology , paleoceanography , ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) and biostratigraphy archaeologists study taphonomic processes in order to determine how plant and animal ( including human ) remains accumulate and differentially preserve within archaeological sites zooarchaeology , a focus within environmental archaeology investigates taphonomic processes on animal remains fernandez jalvo , yolanda and peter andrews , “ methods in taphonomy ” in atlas of taphonomic identifications : 1001+ images of fossil and recent mammal bone modification , ed any factor that affects the likelihood that an organism is preserved as a fossil is a potential source of bias it is thus arguably the most important goal of taphonomy to identify the scope of such biases such that they can be quantified to allow correct interpretations of the relative abundances of organisms that make up a fossil biota first and foremost , organisms that biomineralization have a far greater chance of being represented in the fossil record than organisms consisting of soft tissue only many animals that moult , on the other hand , are overrepresented , as one animal may leave multiple fossils due to its discarded body parts especially shallow sea coasts produce large amounts of fossils , so organisms living in such conditions have a much higher chance of being preserved as fossils than organisms living in non-depositing conditions in continental environments , fossilization is especially likely in small lakes that gradually fill in with organic and inorganic material and especially in bog a sedimentary deposit may have experienced a mixing of noncontemporaneous remains within single sedimentary units via physical or biological processes ; i.e an example of a more ideal deposit with respect to time-averaging bias would be a volcanic ash deposit , which captures an entire biota caught in the wrong place at the wrong time ( e.g thus the fossil record is biased towards periods of greatest sedimentation ; periods of time that have less sedimentation are consequently less well represented in the fossil record a related problem is the slow changes that occur in the depositional environment of an area ; a deposit may experience periods of poor preservation due to , for example , a lack of biomineralizing elements taxonomic bias : fossils with easily discernible morphologies will be easy to distinguish as separate species , and will thus have an inflated abundance it was thought that only tough , cuticle type soft tissue could be preserved by burgess shale type preservation , but an increasing number of organisms are being discovered that lack such cuticle , such as the probable chordate pikaia and the shellless odontogriphus anoxia does , however , reduce the probability that scavengers will disturb the dead organism , and the activity of other organisms is undoubtedly one of the leading causes of soft-tissue destruction beecher 's trilobite type preservation bitter springs type preservation burgess shale type preservation doushantuo type preservation ediacaran type preservation fossil record karen chin lagerstätte permineralization petrifaction pseudofossil trace fossil

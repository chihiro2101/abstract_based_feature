taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences fields that employ the concept of taphonomy include : archaeobotany archaeology biology forensic science geoarchaeology geology paleoecology paleontology zooarchaeology there are five main stages of taphonomy : disarticulation , dispersal , accumulation , fossilization , and mechanical alteration the first stage , disarticulation , occurs as the organism decays and the bones are no longer held together by the flesh and tendons of the organism the final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration ; these are the processes that physically alter the remains ( i.e taphonomy has undergone an explosion of interest since the 1980s , with research focusing on certain areas the outlines of megabiases in the fossil record , including the evolution of new bauplans and behavioral capabilities , and by broad-scale changes in climate , tectonics , and geochemistry of earth surface systems one motivation behind taphonomy is to understand biases present in the fossil record better for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition during the late twentieth century , taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as paleobiology , paleoceanography , ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) and biostratigraphy forensic taphonomy is a relatively new field that has increased in popularity in the past 15 years it is a subfield of forensic anthropology focusing specifically on how taphonomic forces have altered criminal evidence the main factors that affect this branch are categorized into three groups : environmental factors ; external variables , individual factors ; factors from the organism itself ( i.e taphonomy allows specialists to identify what artifacts or remains encountered before and after initial burial zooarchaeology , a focus within environmental archaeology investigates taphonomic processes on animal remains fernandez jalvo , yolanda and peter andrews , “ methods in taphonomy ” in atlas of taphonomic identifications : 1001+ images of fossil and recent mammal bone modification , ed when there is little to no written record , taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants the field of environmental archaeology provides crucial information for attempting to understand the resilience of past societies and the great impacts that environmental shifts can have on a population taphonomic biases in the fossil record any factor that affects the likelihood that an organism is preserved as a fossil is a potential source of bias this perhaps represents the biggest source of bias in the fossil record soft-bodied organisms may form 30 % to 100 % of the biota , but most fossil assemblages preserve none of this unseen diversity , which may exclude groups such as fungi and entire animal phyla from the fossil record thus the fossil record is biased towards periods of greatest sedimentation ; periods of time that have less sedimentation are consequently less well represented in the fossil record this interconnectedness makes the chemicals less prone to chemical decay , and also means they are a poorer source of energy so less likely to be digested by scavenging organisms from the time of death or burial until excavation , taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments

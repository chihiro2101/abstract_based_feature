taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences this is a multidisciplinary concept and is used in slightly different contexts throughout different fields of study the first stage , disarticulation , occurs as the organism decays and the bones are no longer held together by the flesh and tendons of the organism when mineral rich groundwater permeates organic materials and fills the empty spaces , a fossil is formed the final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration ; these are the processes that physically alter the remains ( i.e microbe , biogeochemical , and larger-scale controls on the preservation of different tissue types ; in particular , exceptional preservation in lagerstätte processes that concentrate biological remains ; especially the degree to which different types of assemblages reflect the species composition and abundance of source faunas and floras the outlines of megabiases in the fossil record , including the evolution of new bauplans and behavioral capabilities , and by broad-scale changes in climate , tectonics , and geochemistry of earth surface systems one motivation behind taphonomy is to understand biases present in the fossil record better fossils are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks , yet paleontologys can not draw the most accurate conclusions about the lives and ecology of the fossilized organisms without knowing about the processes involved in their fossilization for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition during the late twentieth century , taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as paleobiology , paleoceanography , ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) and biostratigraphy forensic taphonomy is a relatively new field that has increased in popularity in the past 15 years environmental archaeology is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on understanding the past relationships between groups and their environments the main subfields of environmental archaeology include zooarchaeology , paleobotany , and geoarchaeology taphonomy allows specialists to identify what artifacts or remains encountered before and after initial burial fernandez jalvo , yolanda and peter andrews , “ methods in taphonomy ” in atlas of taphonomic identifications : 1001+ images of fossil and recent mammal bone modification , ed '' taphonomy and contextual zooarchaeology in urban deposits at york , uk when there is little to no written record , taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants the field of environmental archaeology provides crucial information for attempting to understand the resilience of past societies and the great impacts that environmental shifts can have on a population species not endemic to that area ) when the sedimentology is dominated by gravity-driven surges , such as mudslides , or may become biased if there are very few endemic organisms to be preserved this interconnectedness makes the chemicals less prone to chemical decay , and also means they are a poorer source of energy so less likely to be digested by scavenging organisms it is a common misconception that anaerobic conditions are necessary for the preservation of soft tissue ; indeed much decay is mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria which can only survive in anaerobic conditions from the time of death or burial until excavation , taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments

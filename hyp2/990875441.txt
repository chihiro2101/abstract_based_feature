taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases : biostratinomy ; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial , and diagenesis ; events that occur after the burial since efremov 's definition , taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences this is a multidisciplinary concept and is used in slightly different contexts throughout different fields of study the final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration ; these are the processes that physically alter the remains ( i.e for example , chemical changes occur at every stage of the process , because of bacteria taphonomy has undergone an explosion of interest since the 1980s , with research focusing on certain areas microbe , biogeochemical , and larger-scale controls on the preservation of different tissue types ; in particular , exceptional preservation in lagerst√§tte processes that concentrate biological remains ; especially the degree to which different types of assemblages reflect the species composition and abundance of source faunas and floras the spatio-temporal resolution and ecological fidelity of species assemblages , particularly the relatively minor role of out-of-habitat transport contrasted with the major effects of time-averaging the mars science laboratory mission objectives evolved from assessment of ancient mars habitability to developing predictive models on taphonomy one motivation behind taphonomy is to understand biases present in the fossil record better for example , if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another , one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers , or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition during the late twentieth century , taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as paleobiology , paleoceanography , ichnology ( the study of trace fossils ) and biostratigraphy by coming to understand the oceanographic and ethology implications of observed taphonomic patterns , paleontologists have been able to provide new and meaningful interpretations and correlations that would have otherwise remained obscure in the fossil record forensic taphonomy is a relatively new field that has increased in popularity in the past 15 years there are two different branches of forensic taphonomy : biotaphonomy and geotaphonomy taphonomy allows specialists to identify what artifacts or remains encountered before and after initial burial zooarchaeology , a focus within environmental archaeology investigates taphonomic processes on animal remains when there is little to no written record , taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants the field of environmental archaeology provides crucial information for attempting to understand the resilience of past societies and the great impacts that environmental shifts can have on a population because of the very select processes that cause preservation , not all organisms have the same chance of being preserved any factor that affects the likelihood that an organism is preserved as a fossil is a potential source of bias many animals that moult , on the other hand , are overrepresented , as one animal may leave multiple fossils due to its discarded body parts relative ease of extraction : fossils that are easy to obtain ( such as many phosphatic fossils that are easily extracted en masse by dissolution in acid ) are overabundant in the fossil record from the time of death or burial until excavation , taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments

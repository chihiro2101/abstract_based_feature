the following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies , described by bonaparte in 1838 , is known as the american peregrine falcon , or '' duck hawk '' ; its scientific name means '' duck peregrine falcon '' most mature anatum , except those that breed in more northern areas , winter in their breeding range most vagrants that reach western europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory tundrius , only considered distinct since 1968 falco peregrinus babylonicus , described by p.l it is paler than pelegrinoides , and somewhat similar to a small , pale lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) falco peregrinus brookei , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the mediterranean peregrine falcon or the maltese falcon males weigh around , while females weigh up to , described by john latham in 1790 , was formerly called leucogenys and includes caeruleiceps it breeds in the arctic tundra of eurasia , from murmansk oblast to roughly yana and indigirka rivers , siberia it is completely migratory , and travels south in winter as far as south asia and sub-saharan africa falco peregrinus cassini , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the austral peregrine falcon it includes kreyenborgi , the pallid falcon , a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost south america , which was long believed to be a distinct species its range includes south america from ecuador through bolivia , northern argentina , and chile to tierra del fuego and the falkland islands it is similar to nominate , but slightly smaller with a black ear region the variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above , has little barring below , and has a head pattern like the saker falcon , but the ear region is white it is a dark form , resembling pealei in colour , but darker , especially on the tail falco peregrinus macropus , described by swainson in 1837 , is the australian peregrine falcon falco peregrinus madens , described by ripley and watson in 1963 , is unusual in having some sexual dichromatism if the barbary falcon ( see below ) is considered a distinct species , it is sometimes placed therein males have a rufous wash on crown , nape , ears , and back ; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown falco peregrinus pealei , described by ridgway in 1873 , is also known as peale 's falcon , and includes rudolfi it is the largest subspecies , and it looks like an oversized and darker tundrius or like a strongly barred and large anatum falco peregrinus pelegrinoides , first described by temminck in 1829 , is found in the canary islands through north africa and the near east to mesopotamia it is most similar to brookei , but is markedly paler above , with a rusty neck , and is a light buff with reduced barring below it was formerly sometimes known as falco atriceps or falco shaheen it has a clutch size of 3 to 4 eggs , with the chicks fledging time of 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest in india , apart from nesting on cliffs , it has also been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and cellphone transmission towers it includes brevirostris , germanicus , rhenanus , and riphaeus falco peregrinus radama , described by hartlaub in 1861 , is found in madagascar and the comoros white in 1968 , was at one time included in leucogenys it is also paler than anatum ; most have a conspicuous white forehead and white in ear region , but the crown and '' moustache '' are very dark , unlike in calidus these birds inhabit arid regions from the canary islands along the rim of the sahara through the middle east to central asia and mongolia barbary falcons have a red neck patch but otherwise differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to gloger 's rule , relating pigmentation to climate the barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying , beating only the outer part of its wings like fulmars sometimes do ; this also occurs in the peregrine , but less often and far less pronounced the barbary falcon 's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine , and its feet are smaller barbary falcons breed at different times of year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies , but they are capable of interbreeding there is a 0.6–0.7 % genetic distance in the peregrine-barbary falcon ( '' peregrinoid '' ) complex the peregrine falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges , river valleys , coastlines , and increasingly in cities only populations that breed in arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter to protect their eyes , the falcons use their nictitating membranes ( third eyelids ) to spread tears and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision the peregrine falcon is host to a range of parasites and pathogens this falcon tends to nest on tall buildings or bridges , and these urban dwelling birds subsist mostly on different pigeons the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds smaller hawks and owls are regularly predated , mainly smaller falcons such as the american kestrel , merlin and sharp-shinned hawks bats as prey of diurnal birds : a global perspective in the brazilian mangrove swamp of cubatão , a wintering falcon of the subspecies tundrius was observed while successfully hunting a juvenile scarlet ibis a pair mates for life and returns to the same nesting spot annually these pesticides caused falcon prey to also have thinner eggshells ( one example of prey being the black petrels ) since peregrine eggs and chicks are still often targeted by illegal poachers , it is common practice not to publicize unprotected nest locations populations of the peregrine falcon have bounced back in most parts of the world list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )

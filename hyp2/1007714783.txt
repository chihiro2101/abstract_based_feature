the following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies , described by bonaparte in 1838 , is known as the american peregrine falcon , or '' duck hawk '' ; its scientific name means '' duck peregrine falcon '' it is mainly found in the rocky mountains today it was formerly common throughout north america between the tundra and northern mexico , where current reintroduction efforts seek to restore the population most mature anatum , except those that breed in more northern areas , winter in their breeding range most vagrants that reach western europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory tundrius , only considered distinct since 1968 it has become extinct in eastern north america , and populations there are hybrids as a result of reintroductions of birds from elsewhere it is paler than pelegrinoides , and somewhat similar to a small , pale lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) males weigh , while females weigh falco peregrinus brookei , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the mediterranean peregrine falcon or the maltese falcon falco peregrinus cassini , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the austral peregrine falcon it includes kreyenborgi , the pallid falcon , a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost south america , which was long believed to be a distinct species the variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above , has little barring below , and has a head pattern like the saker falcon , but the ear region is white falco peregrinus furuitii , described by momiyama in 1927 , is found on the izu and ogasawara islands south of honshū , japan it is a dark form , resembling pealei in colour , but darker , especially on the tail it is found from northeast siberia to kamchatka ( though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there ) and japan it is similar to peregrinus , but the young are even darker than those of anatum falco peregrinus macropus , described by swainson in 1837 , is the australian peregrine falcon it is similar to brookei in appearance , but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black falco peregrinus madens , described by ripley and watson in 1963 , is unusual in having some sexual dichromatism if the barbary falcon ( see below ) is considered a distinct species , it is sometimes placed therein falco peregrinus pealei , described by ridgway in 1873 , is also known as peale 's falcon , and includes rudolfi it is most similar to brookei , but is markedly paler above , with a rusty neck , and is a light buff with reduced barring below it is smaller than the nominate ; females weigh around falco peregrinus peregrinator , described by sundevall in 1837 , is known as the indian peregrine falcon , black shaheen , indian shaheen or shaheen falcon in india , the shaheen is reported from all states except uttar pradesh , mainly from rocky and hilly regions the shaheen is also reported from the andaman and nicobar islands in the bay of bengal a population estimate of 40 breeding pairs in sri lanka was made in 1996 falco peregrinus submelanogenys , described by mathews in 1912 , is the southwest australian peregrine falcon it is also paler than anatum ; most have a conspicuous white forehead and white in ear region , but the crown and '' moustache '' are very dark , unlike in calidus barbary falcons have a red neck patch but otherwise differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to gloger 's rule , relating pigmentation to climate the peregrine falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges , river valleys , coastlines , and increasingly in cities a study testing the flight physics of an '' ideal falcon '' found a theoretical speed limit at for low-altitude flight and for high-altitude flight in 2005 , ken franklin recorded a falcon stooping at a top speed of the life span of peregrine falcons in the wild is up to 19 years 9 months mortality in the first year is 59–70 % , declining to 25–32 % annually in adults the peregrine falcon is host to a range of parasites and pathogens it is a vector for avipoxvirus , newcastle disease virus , falconid herpesvirus 1 ( and possibly other herpesviridae ) , and some mycoses and bacterial infections known peregrine falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice , ceratophyllus garei ( a flea ) , and hippoboscidae flies ( icosta nigra , ornithoctona erythrocephala ) the peregrine falcon feeds almost exclusively on medium-sized birds such as columbidae , waterfowl , songbirds , and waders in north america , prey has varied in size from hummingbirds ( selasphorus and archilochus ssp in urban areas , the main component of the peregrine 's diet is the rock or feral pigeon , which comprise 80 % or more of the dietary intake for peregrines in some cities the peregrine falcon hunts most often at dawn and dusk , when prey are most active , but also nocturnally in cities , particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent prey is plucked before consumption a recent study showed the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species while at the same time causing a decline in its preferred prey as of 2018 , the fastest recorded falcon was at 242 & nbsp ; mph ( nearly 390 & nbsp ; km/h ) the male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air the male ( called the '' '' ) and the female ( simply called the '' falcon '' ) both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young the peregrine falcon became an endangered species over much of its range because of the use of organochlorine pesticides , especially ddt , during the 1950s , '60s , and '70s peregrine falcon recovery teams breed the species in captivity terminology used by peregrine breeders also used the old french term , '' of noble birth ; aristocratic '' , particularly with the peregrine list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )

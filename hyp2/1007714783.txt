the following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies , described by bonaparte in 1838 , is known as the american peregrine falcon , or '' duck hawk '' ; its scientific name means '' duck peregrine falcon '' it was formerly common throughout north america between the tundra and northern mexico , where current reintroduction efforts seek to restore the population most mature anatum , except those that breed in more northern areas , winter in their breeding range it has become extinct in eastern north america , and populations there are hybrids as a result of reintroductions of birds from elsewhere sclater in 1861 , is found in eastern iran along the hindu kush and tian shan to mongolian altai ranges a few birds winter in northern and northwestern india , mainly in dry semi-desert habitats it is paler than pelegrinoides , and somewhat similar to a small , pale lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) falco peregrinus brookei , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the mediterranean peregrine falcon or the maltese falcon they occur from the iberian peninsula around the mediterranean , except in arid regions , to the caucasus it is smaller than the nominate , and the underside usually has rusty hue males weigh around , while females weigh up to falco peregrinus cassini , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the austral peregrine falcon it includes kreyenborgi , the pallid falcon , a leucistic morph occurring in southernmost south america , which was long believed to be a distinct species its range includes south america from ecuador through bolivia , northern argentina , and chile to tierra del fuego and the falkland islands falco peregrinus ernesti , described by sharpe in 1894 , is found from the sunda islands to philippines and south to eastern new guinea and the nearby bismarck archipelago northern populations are migratory , while those of japan are resident falco peregrinus macropus , described by swainson in 1837 , is the australian peregrine falcon it is similar to brookei in appearance , but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black if the barbary falcon ( see below ) is considered a distinct species , it is sometimes placed therein it is found in the cape verde islands , and is non-migratory ; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving it apparently reaches north along the atlantic coast as far as morocco it was formerly sometimes known as falco atriceps or falco shaheen its range includes south asia from across the indian subcontinent to sri lanka and southeastern china in india , the shaheen is reported from all states except uttar pradesh , mainly from rocky and hilly regions the shaheen is also reported from the andaman and nicobar islands in the bay of bengal , the nominate ( first-named ) subspecies , described by tunstall in 1771 , breeds over much of temperate eurasia between the tundra in the north and the pyrenees , mediterranean region and alpide belt in the south it is mainly non-migratory in europe , but migratory in scandinavia and asia falco peregrinus radama , described by hartlaub in 1861 , is found in madagascar and the comoros falco peregrinus submelanogenys , described by mathews in 1912 , is the southwest australian peregrine falcon falco peregrinus tundrius , described by c.m it is also paler than anatum ; most have a conspicuous white forehead and white in ear region , but the crown and '' moustache '' are very dark , unlike in calidus juveniles are browner , and less grey , than in calidus , and paler , sometimes almost sandy , than in anatum despite its current recognition as a valid subspecies , a population genetic study of both pre-decline ( i.e barbary falcons have a red neck patch but otherwise differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to gloger 's rule , relating pigmentation to climate peregrine falcons have a flicker fusion threshold of 129 & nbsp ; hz ( cycles per second ) , very fast for a bird of its size , and much faster than mammals mortality in the first year is 59–70 % , declining to 25–32 % annually in adults apart from such anthropogenic threats as collision with human-made objects , the peregrine may be killed by larger hawks and owls known peregrine falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice , ceratophyllus garei ( a flea ) , and hippoboscidae flies ( icosta nigra , ornithoctona erythrocephala ) in the arctic peregrine falcons chasing away small rodent predators from their nesting territory and rough-legged hawks ( buteo lagopus ) could use these hot spots as a nesting territory this falcon tends to nest on tall buildings or bridges , and these urban dwelling birds subsist mostly on different pigeons worldwide , it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species ( up to roughly a fifth of the world 's bird species ) are predated somewhere by these falcons the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds smaller hawks and owls are regularly predated , mainly smaller falcons such as the american kestrel , merlin and sharp-shinned hawks other than bats taken at night , mikula , p the peregrine rarely hunts mammals , but will on occasion take small species such as rats , voles , hares , shrews , mice and squirrels nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as yellow-billed cuckoo , black-necked grebe , virginia rail , and common quail once prey is spotted , it begins its stoop , folding back the tail and wings , with feet tucked in addition , peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests , from birds such as kittiwakes these pesticides caused falcon prey to also have thinner eggshells ( one example of prey being the black petrels ) during the 1970s , peregrine falcons in finland experienced a population bottleneck as a result of large declines associated with bio-accumulation of organochloride pesticides list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )

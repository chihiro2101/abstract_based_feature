the following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies , described by bonaparte in 1838 , is known as the american peregrine falcon , or '' duck hawk '' ; its scientific name means '' duck peregrine falcon '' it was formerly common throughout north america between the tundra and northern mexico , where current reintroduction efforts seek to restore the population most mature anatum , except those that breed in more northern areas , winter in their breeding range most vagrants that reach western europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory tundrius , only considered distinct since 1968 it is similar to peregrinus but is slightly smaller ; adults are somewhat paler and less patterned below , but juveniles are darker and more patterned below falco peregrinus babylonicus , described by p.l it is paler than pelegrinoides , and somewhat similar to a small , pale lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) falco peregrinus brookei , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the mediterranean peregrine falcon or the maltese falcon males weigh around , while females weigh up to , described by john latham in 1790 , was formerly called leucogenys and includes caeruleiceps it is paler than peregrinus , especially on the crown falco peregrinus cassini , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the austral peregrine falcon its range includes south america from ecuador through bolivia , northern argentina , and chile to tierra del fuego and the falkland islands the variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above , has little barring below , and has a head pattern like the saker falcon , but the ear region is white falco peregrinus ernesti , described by sharpe in 1894 , is found from the sunda islands to philippines and south to eastern new guinea and the nearby bismarck archipelago it differs from the nominate in the very dark , dense barring on its underside and its black ear coverts it is found from northeast siberia to kamchatka ( though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there ) and japan it is similar to brookei in appearance , but is slightly smaller and the ear region is entirely black if the barbary falcon ( see below ) is considered a distinct species , it is sometimes placed therein it is found in the cape verde islands , and is non-migratory ; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving falco peregrinus nesiotes , described by mayr in 1941 , is found in fiji and probably also vanuatu and new caledonia falco peregrinus pealei , described by ridgway in 1873 , is also known as peale 's falcon , and includes rudolfi it is most similar to brookei , but is markedly paler above , with a rusty neck , and is a light buff with reduced barring below it is smaller than the nominate ; females weigh around falco peregrinus peregrinator , described by sundevall in 1837 , is known as the indian peregrine falcon , black shaheen , indian shaheen or shaheen falcon it was formerly sometimes known as falco atriceps or falco shaheen the shaheen is also reported from the andaman and nicobar islands in the bay of bengal it has a clutch size of 3 to 4 eggs , with the chicks fledging time of 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest in india , apart from nesting on cliffs , it has also been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and cellphone transmission towers in sri lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while the migrant calidus is more often seen along the coast , the nominate ( first-named ) subspecies , described by tunstall in 1771 , breeds over much of temperate eurasia between the tundra in the north and the pyrenees , mediterranean region and alpide belt in the south falco peregrinus radama , described by hartlaub in 1861 , is found in madagascar and the comoros falco peregrinus submelanogenys , described by mathews in 1912 , is the southwest australian peregrine falcon most vagrants that reach western europe belong to this subspecies , which was previously united with anatum , museum ) and recovered contemporary populations failed to distinguish genetically the anatum and tundrius subspecies these birds inhabit arid regions from the canary islands along the rim of the sahara through the middle east to central asia and mongolia barbary falcons breed at different times of year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies , but they are capable of interbreeding in mild-winter regions , it is usually a permanent resident , and some individuals , especially adult males , will remain on the breeding territory the peregrine falcon reaches faster speeds than any other animal on the planet when performing the stoop , which involves soaring to a great height and then diving steeply at speeds of over , hitting one wing of its prey so as not to harm itself on impact to protect their eyes , the falcons use their nictitating membranes ( third eyelids ) to spread tears and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision peregrine falcons have a flicker fusion threshold of 129 & nbsp ; hz ( cycles per second ) , very fast for a bird of its size , and much faster than mammals apart from such anthropogenic threats as collision with human-made objects , the peregrine may be killed by larger hawks and owls the peregrine falcon feeds almost exclusively on medium-sized birds such as columbidae , waterfowl , songbirds , and waders this falcon tends to nest on tall buildings or bridges , and these urban dwelling birds subsist mostly on different pigeons ) to a sandhill crane ( killed in alaska by a peregrine in a stoop ) , although most prey taken by peregrines weigh from ( small passerines ) to ( such as ducks and gulls ) the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds smaller hawks and owls are regularly predated , mainly smaller falcons such as the american kestrel , merlin and sharp-shinned hawks before the demise of most european peregrines , a large population of peregrines in central and western europe used the disused nests of other large birds they are incubated for 29 to 33 days , mainly by the female , with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day , but only the female incubating them at night these pesticides caused falcon prey to also have thinner eggshells ( one example of prey being the black petrels ) list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )

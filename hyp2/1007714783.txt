it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving males have a rufous wash on crown , nape , ears , and back ; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown females are tinged rich brown overall , especially on the crown and nape it is sparsely and patchily distributed throughout much of sub-saharan africa and widespread in southern africa it apparently reaches north along the atlantic coast as far as morocco this is the smallest subspecies of peregrine , with smaller males weighing as little as approximately falco peregrinus pealei , described by ridgway in 1873 , is also known as peale 's falcon , and includes rudolfi falco peregrinus peregrinator , described by sundevall in 1837 , is known as the indian peregrine falcon , black shaheen , indian shaheen or shaheen falcon its range includes south asia from across the indian subcontinent to sri lanka and southeastern china falco peregrinus submelanogenys , described by mathews in 1912 , is the southwest australian peregrine falcon it is found in the arctic tundra of north america to greenland , and migrates to wintering grounds in central and south america , museum ) and recovered contemporary populations failed to distinguish genetically the anatum and tundrius subspecies the barbary falcon 's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine , and its feet are smaller in mild-winter regions , it is usually a permanent resident , and some individuals , especially adult males , will remain on the breeding territory the peregrine falcon feeds almost exclusively on medium-sized birds such as columbidae , waterfowl , songbirds , and waders this falcon tends to nest on tall buildings or bridges , and these urban dwelling birds subsist mostly on different pigeons in north america , prey has varied in size from hummingbirds ( selasphorus and archilochus ssp the peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in north america , with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon , including nearly 100 shorebirds coastal populations of the large subspecies pealei feed almost exclusively on seabirds insects and reptiles make up a small proportion of the diet , which varies greatly depending on what prey is available once prey is spotted , it begins its stoop , folding back the tail and wings , with feet tucked if its prey is too heavy to carry , a peregrine will drop it to the ground and eat it there in addition , peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests , from birds such as kittiwakes as of 2018 , the fastest recorded falcon was at 242 & nbsp ; mph ( nearly 390 & nbsp ; km/h ) the most serious predators of peregrine nests in north america and europe are the great horned owl and the eurasian eagle owl the average number of young found in nests is 2.5 , and the average number that fledge is about 1.5 , due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings peregrine falcons were removed from the united states ' endangered species list in 1999 the peregrine , by j list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )

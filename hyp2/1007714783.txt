the following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies , described by bonaparte in 1838 , is known as the american peregrine falcon , or '' duck hawk '' ; its scientific name means '' duck peregrine falcon '' it was formerly common throughout north america between the tundra and northern mexico , where current reintroduction efforts seek to restore the population most mature anatum , except those that breed in more northern areas , winter in their breeding range most vagrants that reach western europe seem to belong to the more northern and strongly migratory tundrius , only considered distinct since 1968 it is similar to peregrinus but is slightly smaller ; adults are somewhat paler and less patterned below , but juveniles are darker and more patterned below sclater in 1861 , is found in eastern iran along the hindu kush and tian shan to mongolian altai ranges it is paler than pelegrinoides , and somewhat similar to a small , pale lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) falco peregrinus brookei , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the mediterranean peregrine falcon or the maltese falcon it is completely migratory , and travels south in winter as far as south asia and sub-saharan africa falco peregrinus cassini , described by sharpe in 1873 , is also known as the austral peregrine falcon the variation kreyenborgi is medium grey above , has little barring below , and has a head pattern like the saker falcon , but the ear region is white falco peregrinus ernesti , described by sharpe in 1894 , is found from the sunda islands to philippines and south to eastern new guinea and the nearby bismarck archipelago falco peregrinus furuitii , described by momiyama in 1927 , is found on the izu and ogasawara islands south of honshÅ« , japan it is found from northeast siberia to kamchatka ( though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there ) and japan northern populations are migratory , while those of japan are resident it is similar to peregrinus , but the young are even darker than those of anatum falco peregrinus macropus , described by swainson in 1837 , is the australian peregrine falcon it is found in australia in all regions except the southwest falco peregrinus madens , described by ripley and watson in 1963 , is unusual in having some sexual dichromatism if the barbary falcon ( see below ) is considered a distinct species , it is sometimes placed therein it is found in the cape verde islands , and is non-migratory ; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving males have a rufous wash on crown , nape , ears , and back ; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown it is the largest subspecies , and it looks like an oversized and darker tundrius or like a strongly barred and large anatum juveniles occasionally have pale crowns falco peregrinus pelegrinoides , first described by temminck in 1829 , is found in the canary islands through north africa and the near east to mesopotamia it is most similar to brookei , but is markedly paler above , with a rusty neck , and is a light buff with reduced barring below a population estimate of 40 breeding pairs in sri lanka was made in 1996 in sri lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while the migrant calidus is more often seen along the coast it is mainly non-migratory in europe , but migratory in scandinavia and asia falco peregrinus radama , described by hartlaub in 1861 , is found in madagascar and the comoros falco peregrinus submelanogenys , described by mathews in 1912 , is the southwest australian peregrine falcon it is the new world equivalent to calidus despite its current recognition as a valid subspecies , a population genetic study of both pre-decline ( i.e barbary falcons breed at different times of year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies , but they are capable of interbreeding only populations that breed in arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter to protect their eyes , the falcons use their nictitating membranes ( third eyelids ) to spread tears and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision the life span of peregrine falcons in the wild is up to 19 years 9 months it is a vector for avipoxvirus , newcastle disease virus , falconid herpesvirus 1 ( and possibly other herpesviridae ) , and some mycoses and bacterial infections endoparasites include plasmodium relictum ( usually not causing malaria in the peregrine falcon ) , strigeidae trematodes , serratospiculum amaculata ( nematode ) , and tapeworms known peregrine falcon ectoparasites are chewing lice , ceratophyllus garei ( a flea ) , and hippoboscidae flies ( icosta nigra , ornithoctona erythrocephala ) the peregrine falcon feeds almost exclusively on medium-sized birds such as columbidae , waterfowl , songbirds , and waders worldwide , it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species ( up to roughly a fifth of the world 's bird species ) are predated somewhere by these falcons ) to a sandhill crane ( killed in alaska by a peregrine in a stoop ) , although most prey taken by peregrines weigh from ( small passerines ) to ( such as ducks and gulls ) in urban areas , the main component of the peregrine 's diet is the rock or feral pigeon , which comprise 80 % or more of the dietary intake for peregrines in some cities the hunting territory of the parents can extend a radius of from the nest site the females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species , pheasant , and grouse peregrine falcons have been successfully bred in captivity , both for falconry and for release into the wild the widespread restriction of ddt use eventually allowed released birds to breed successfully due to its striking hunting technique , the peregrine has often been associated with aggression and martial prowess terminology used by peregrine breeders also used the old french term , '' of noble birth ; aristocratic '' , particularly with the peregrine list of birds by flight speed perilanner , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the lanner falcon ( falco biarmicus ) perlin , a hybrid of the peregrine falcon and the merlin ( falco columbarius )

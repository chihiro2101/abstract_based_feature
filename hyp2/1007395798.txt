on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds classical cepheids and type ii cepheids follow different period-luminosity relationships the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) rr lyrae stars , then known as cluster variables , were recognized fairly early as being a separate class of variable , due in part to their short periods the mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by arthur stanley eddington ( who wrote at length on the dynamics of cepheids ) , but it was not until 1953 that s cepheid variables are divided into two subclasses which exhibit markedly different masses , ages , and evolutionary histories : classical cepheids and type ii cepheids classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months a group of classical cepheids with small amplitudes and sinusoidal light curves are often separated out as small amplitude cepheids or s-cepheids , many of them pulsating in the first overtone type ii cepheids are divided into several subgroups by period type ii cepheids are used to establish the distance to the galactic center , globular clusters , and galaxies anomalous cepheid variables have masses higher than type ii cepheids , rr lyrae variables , and our sun

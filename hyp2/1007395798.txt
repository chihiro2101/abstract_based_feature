on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds in the 1940s , walter baade recognized two separate populations of cepheids ( classical and type ii ) classical cepheids are younger and more massive population i stars , whereas type ii cepheids are older fainter population ii stars the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) delta scuti variables and rr lyrae variables are not generally treated with cepheid variables although their pulsations originate with the same helium ionisation kappa mechanism classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months type ii cepheids ( also termed population ii cepheids ) are population ii variable stars which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days stars with periods between 1 and 4 days are of the bl her subclass , 10â€“20 days belong to the w virginis variable , and stars with periods greater than 20 days belong to the rv tauri variable anomalous cepheid variables have masses higher than type ii cepheids , rr lyrae variables , and our sun the accuracy of the distance measurements to cepheid variables and other bodies within 7,500 lightyears is vastly improved by combining images from hubble taken six months apart when the earth and hubble are on opposite sides of the sun type ii cepheids include : w virginis and bl herculis

on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later the number of similar variables grew to several dozen by the end of the 19th century , and they were referred to as a class as cepheids in 1924 , edwin hubble established the distance to classical cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy , until then known as the andromeda nebula , and showed that the variables were not members of the milky way classical cepheids are younger and more massive population i stars , whereas type ii cepheids are older fainter population ii stars classical cepheids and type ii cepheids follow different period-luminosity relationships the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) rr lyrae stars , then known as cluster variables , were recognized fairly early as being a separate class of variable , due in part to their short periods classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months classical cepheids are population i variable stars which are 4â€“20 times more massive than the sun , and up to 100,000 times more luminous classical cepheids are used to determine distances to galaxies within the local group and beyond , and are a means by which the hubble constant can be established anomalous cepheid variables have masses higher than type ii cepheids , rr lyrae variables , and our sun type ii cepheids include : w virginis and bl herculis

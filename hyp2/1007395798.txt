on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later most of the cepheids were known from the distinctive light curve shapes with the rapid increase in brightness and a hump , but some with more symmetrical light curves were known as geminids after the prototype Î¶ geminorum a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds in 1924 , edwin hubble established the distance to classical cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy , until then known as the andromeda nebula , and showed that the variables were not members of the milky way classical cepheids are younger and more massive population i stars , whereas type ii cepheids are older fainter population ii stars classical cepheids and type ii cepheids follow different period-luminosity relationships the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) cepheid variables are divided into two subclasses which exhibit markedly different masses , ages , and evolutionary histories : classical cepheids and type ii cepheids delta scuti variables and rr lyrae variables are not generally treated with cepheid variables although their pulsations originate with the same helium ionisation kappa mechanism type ii cepheids ( also termed population ii cepheids ) are population ii variable stars which pulsate with periods typically between 1 and 50 days anomalous cepheid variables have masses higher than type ii cepheids , rr lyrae variables , and our sun type ii cepheids include : w virginis and bl herculis

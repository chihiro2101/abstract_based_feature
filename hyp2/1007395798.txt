however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds in 1924 , edwin hubble established the distance to classical cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy , until then known as the andromeda nebula , and showed that the variables were not members of the milky way classical cepheids are younger and more massive population i stars , whereas type ii cepheids are older fainter population ii stars the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) baade 's seminal discovery led to a twofold increase in the distance to m31 , and the extragalactic distance scale the mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by arthur stanley eddington ( who wrote at length on the dynamics of cepheids ) , but it was not until 1953 that s zhevakin identified ionized helium as a likely valve for the engine cepheid variables are divided into two subclasses which exhibit markedly different masses , ages , and evolutionary histories : classical cepheids and type ii cepheids delta scuti variables and rr lyrae variables are not generally treated with cepheid variables although their pulsations originate with the same helium ionisation kappa mechanism classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months delta cephei is also of particular importance as a calibrator of the cepheid period-luminosity relation since its distance is among the most precisely established for a cepheid , partly because it is a member of a star cluster and the availability of precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes at the dimmest part of a cepheid 's cycle , the ionized gas in the outer layers of the star is opaque , and so is heated by the star 's radiation , and due to the increased temperature , begins to expand

on september 10 , 1784 , edward pigott detected the variability of eta aquilae , the first known representative of the class of classical cepheid variables however , the eponymous star for classical cepheids is delta cephei , discovered to be variable by john goodricke a few months later most of the cepheids were known from the distinctive light curve shapes with the rapid increase in brightness and a hump , but some with more symmetrical light curves were known as geminids after the prototype ζ geminorum a relationship between the period and luminosity for classical cepheids was discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt in an investigation of thousands of variable stars in the magellanic clouds in 1924 , edwin hubble established the distance to classical cepheid variables in the andromeda galaxy , until then known as the andromeda nebula , and showed that the variables were not members of the milky way classical cepheids are younger and more massive population i stars , whereas type ii cepheids are older fainter population ii stars classical cepheids and type ii cepheids follow different period-luminosity relationships the luminosity of type ii cepheids is , on average , less than classical cepheids by about 1.5 magnitudes ( but still brighter than rr lyrae stars ) the mechanics of the pulsation as a heat-engine was proposed in 1917 by arthur stanley eddington ( who wrote at length on the dynamics of cepheids ) , but it was not until 1953 that s classical cepheids ( also known as population i cepheids , type i cepheids , or delta cepheid variables ) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months classical cepheids are population i variable stars which are 4–20 times more massive than the sun , and up to 100,000 times more luminous delta cephei is also of particular importance as a calibrator of the cepheid period-luminosity relation since its distance is among the most precisely established for a cepheid , partly because it is a member of a star cluster and the availability of precise hubble space telescope/hipparcos parallaxes type ii cepheids include : w virginis and bl herculis

lúthien was a telerin ( sindarin ) princess , the only child of thingol , king of doriath , and his queen , melian the maia , making her half-royal , half-divine lúthien 's romance with the mortal man beren is considered the '' chief '' of the silmarillion tales by tolkien himself ; he called it '' the kernel of the mythology '' , 30 june 1955 elrond was lúthien 's great-grandson and aragorn was descended from her via elros and the royal family of númenor in contrast , lúthien 's descendant arwen was called evenstar , the evening star of the elves , meaning that her beauty reflects that of lúthien tinúviel lúthien was first cousin once removed of galadriel , whose mother , eärwen of alqualondë , was the daughter of thingol 's brother the story of lúthien and beren is mirrored in the tale of aragorn and arwen the name lúthien appears to mean '' daughter of flowers '' in a beleriandic dialect of sindarin , but it can also be translated '' blossom '' '' the languages of tolkien 's middle-earth '' , page 166 beren saw lúthien dancing under moonrise in her father 's forest , and fell in love with her , for she was the most beautiful of elves and men when lúthien gazed upon him for the first time she reciprocated his love thingol did not kill beren outright as he had promised lúthien that he would spare beren 's life she sought the counsel of her mother who told her that beren was captive in the dungeons of sauron , the dark lord 's evil lieutenant lúthien decided to save beren they came to sauron 's isle , and lúthien sang a call to beren huan flinched , but lúthien smothered sauron 's lunge in the folds of her enchanted cloak lúthien forced the defeated sauron to surrender the keys of his tower ; he fled in the shape of a vampire finding beren , she thought him dead and fell down beside him in grief , but with the rising sun he awoke and they were reunited together beren and luthien reached the throne of morgoth , but the dark lord saw through lúthien 's disguise beren told thingol that the quest was , indeed , fulfilled , and that he held a silmaril in his hand he summoned beren from the houses of the dead , and lúthien 's spirit met his for the last time by the shores of the sea however tolkien initially created the character of beren as a mortal man before this in an even earlier but erased version of the tale in a letter to his son christopher , dated 11 july 1972 , tolkien requested the inscription below for his wife edith 's grave '' for she was ( and knew she was ) my lúthien their gravestone shows the association of lúthien with edith , and tolkien with beren

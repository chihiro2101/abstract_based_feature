united states counterintelligence program to decrypt messages transmitted by the intelligence agency of the soviet union initiated when the soviet union was an ally of the us , the program continued during the cold war , when it was considered an enemy in 1995 , the us government made public many documents decoded by the venona project , showing julius rosenberg 's role as part of a productive ring of spies the cable also makes clear that the sister 's husband is involved enough in espionage to have his own code name ( '' liberal '' ) nevertheless , these decryptions formed the background of us government investigation and prosecutions of american communists during the cold war period deputy attorney general of the united states william p in a subsequent letter to the new york times ,

on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft however , in looser usage , an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing ( typically a casting ) is also called an axle thus , transverse pairs of wheels in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts a non-driving axle , such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans , will have no shaft , and serves only as a suspension and steering component conversely , many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle like a full floating axle system , the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight even when the suspension is not independent , split axles permit the use of a differential , allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns , improving traction and extending tire life in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks , the engine turns a driveshaft ( also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft ) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle at the rear of the vehicle the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential some simple vehicle designs , such as leisure go-karts , may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine , or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential ( kart racing ) a dead axle located immediately in front of a drive axle is called a pusher axle lifting an axle also alleviates lateral scrubbing of the additional axle in very tight turns , allowing the vehicle to turn more readily a full-floating axle carries the vehicle 's weight on the axle casing , not the halfshafts ; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels in contrast , a semi-floating design carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle shaft itself ; there is a single bearing at the end of the axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through to remove the semi-floating axle , one has to remove a wheel first ; if such axle breaks , the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle

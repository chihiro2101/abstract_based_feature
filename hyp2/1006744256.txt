on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft thus , transverse pairs of wheels in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts a non-driving axle , such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans , will have no shaft , and serves only as a suspension and steering component in other types of suspension systems , the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels ; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system the axle shafts ( usually constant-velocity type ) then transmit driving torque to the wheels like a full floating axle system , the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight a straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side the axis of rotation fixed by the axle is common to both wheels the drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential the rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a dead axle a dead axle located immediately in front of a drive axle is called a pusher axle a full-floating axle carries the vehicle 's weight on the axle casing , not the halfshafts ; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels the semi-floating axle features only one bearing , while the full-floating assembly has bearings in both the inside and outside of the wheel hub a benefit of a full-floating axle is that even if an axle shaft ( used to transmit torque or power ) breaks , the wheel will not come off , preventing serious accidents .

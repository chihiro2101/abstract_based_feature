on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft however , in looser usage , an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing ( typically a casting ) is also called an axle thus , transverse pairs of wheels in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts in a live-axle suspension system , the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel , as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body a non-driving axle , such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans , will have no shaft , and serves only as a suspension and steering component they may be attached to the vehicle frame or body , or integral in a transaxle the axle shafts ( usually constant-velocity type ) then transmit driving torque to the wheels like a full floating axle system , the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight a straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side the axis of rotation fixed by the axle is common to both wheels the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential a tag axle is a dead axle situated behind a drive axle in contrast , a semi-floating design carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle shaft itself ; there is a single bearing at the end of the axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through the semi-floating axle features only one bearing , while the full-floating assembly has bearings in both the inside and outside of the wheel hub to remove the semi-floating axle , one has to remove a wheel first ; if such axle breaks , the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle

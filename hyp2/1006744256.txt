on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft however , in looser usage , an entire assembly including the surrounding axle housing ( typically a casting ) is also called an axle thus , transverse pairs of wheels in an independent suspension may be called an axle in some contexts in a live-axle suspension system , the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel , as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body a non-driving axle , such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans , will have no shaft , and serves only as a suspension and steering component conversely , many front-wheel drive cars have a solid rear beam axle in other types of suspension systems , the axles serve only to transmit driving torque to the wheels ; the position and angle of the wheel hubs is an independent function of the suspension system like a full floating axle system , the drive shafts in a front-wheel drive independent suspension system do not support any vehicle weight a straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential some simple vehicle designs , such as leisure go-karts , may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine , or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential ( kart racing ) a tag axle is a dead axle situated behind a drive axle some dump trucks and trailers may be configured with a lift axle ( also known as an airlift axle or drop axle ) , which may be mechanically raised or lowered a full-floating axle carries the vehicle 's weight on the axle casing , not the halfshafts ; they serve only to transmit torque from the differential to the wheels to remove the semi-floating axle , one has to remove a wheel first ; if such axle breaks , the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle

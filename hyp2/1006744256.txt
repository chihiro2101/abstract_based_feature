on cars and trucks , several senses of the word axle occur in casual usage , referring to the shaft itself , its housing , or simply any transverse pair of wheels strictly speaking , a shaft which rotates with the wheel , being either bolted or splined in fixed relation to it , is called an axle or axle shaft in a live-axle suspension system , the axles serve to transmit driving torque to the wheel , as well as to maintain the position of the wheels relative to each other and to the vehicle body a non-driving axle , such as the front beam axle in heavy duty trucks and some two-wheel drive light trucks and vans , will have no shaft , and serves only as a suspension and steering component the axle shafts ( usually constant-velocity type ) then transmit driving torque to the wheels a straight axle is a single rigid shaft connecting a wheel on the left side of the vehicle to a wheel on the right side even when the suspension is not independent , split axles permit the use of a differential , allowing the left and right drive wheels to be driven at different speeds as the automobile turns , improving traction and extending tire life the drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles each half axle connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity ( cv ) joint which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically as well as to pivot when making turns in rear-wheel drive cars and trucks , the engine turns a driveshaft ( also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft ) which transmits rotational force to a drive axle at the rear of the vehicle the drive axle may be a live axle , but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential some simple vehicle designs , such as leisure go-karts , may have a single driven wheel where the drive axle is a split axle with only one of the two shafts driven by the engine , or else have both wheels connected to one shaft without a differential ( kart racing ) a tag axle is a dead axle situated behind a drive axle some dump trucks and trailers may be configured with a lift axle ( also known as an airlift axle or drop axle ) , which may be mechanically raised or lowered in contrast , a semi-floating design carries the weight of the vehicle on the axle shaft itself ; there is a single bearing at the end of the axle housing that carries the load from the axle and that the axle rotates through to remove the semi-floating axle , one has to remove a wheel first ; if such axle breaks , the wheel is most likely to come off the vehicle

the universal priesthood is a foundational concept of protestantism '' protestantism originated in the 16th-century reformation , and its basic doctrines , in addition to those of the ancient christian creeds , are justification by grace alone through faith , the priesthood of all believers , and the supremacy of holy scripture in matters of faith and order 2007 while martin luther did not use the exact phrase '' priesthood of all believers '' , he adduces a general priesthood in christendom in his 1520 to the christian nobility of the german nation in order to dismiss the medieval view that christians in the present life were to be divided into two classes : '' spiritual '' and '' secular '' once a year , the high priest would enter the holiest part of the temple and offer a sacrifice for the sins of all the people , including all the priests although many religions use priests , most protestant faiths reject the idea of a priesthood as a group that is spiritually distinct from lay people in many instances , protestants see professional clergy as servants acting on behalf of the local believers this is in contrast to the priest , whom some protestants see as having a distinct authority and spiritual role different from that of ordinary believers god can speak through any person present ; and any planned service is at risk of getting in god 's way ; hence the bulk of the observance is in silence protestants believe that through christ they have been given direct access to god , just like a priest ; thus the doctrine is called the priesthood of all believers this doctrine stands in opposition to the concept of a spiritual aristocracy or hierarchy within christianity ( see clericalism ) the belief in the priesthood of all believers does not preclude order , authority or discipline within congregations or denominational organizations for example , lutheranism maintains the biblical doctrine of '' the preaching office '' or the '' office of the holy ministry '' established by god in the christian church martin luther adduced it in his writings for the purpose of reforming the christian church , and it became a central tenet of protestantism the laestadian pietist movement has a specific interpretation of the doctrine as one of its solemn rites concerning forgiveness of sins roger williams believed , '' there is no regularly constituted church of christ on earth , nor any person qualified to administer any church ordinances ; nor can there be until new apostles are sent by the great head of the church for whose coming i am seeking '' another group , the seekers , believed that the roman catholic church had lost its authority through corruption and waited for christ to restore his true church and authority luther 's doctrine of the universal priesthood of all believers gave laypersons and the clergy equal rights and responsibilities it had strong , far-reaching consequences both within the protestant churches and outside of them with respect to the development of distinct political and societal structures luther had the intention to organize the church in such a way as to give the members of a congregation the right to elect a pastor by majority-decision and , if necessary , to dismiss him again jeremy waldron ( 2002 ) , god , locke , and equality : christian foundations in locke 's political thought , cambridge university press , cambridge ( uk ) , pp geschichte und gegenwart , second , revised edition , munich ( germany ) , pp the church members elected lay elders from their midst who together with pastors , teachers , and deacons , who were also elected by the parishioners , formed the representative church leadership martin ohst [ 2005 ) , toleranz/intoleranz , in : die religion in geschichte und gegenwart , fourth edition , t√ºbingen ( germany ) , vol while these groups appoint leaders , it is held that all members are responsible for the functioning of the church and church meetings catholicism often expresses the idea of the priesthood of all baptized christians in english as the '' common '' or '' universal '' priesthood ; catechism of the catholic church 1546 in parallel , it refers to catholic clergy as the '' ministerial '' priesthood is ministerial priesthood scriptural ? the priesthood is both ministerial and universal the catholic church holds that the consecration of the eucharist and absolution from sin may only be validly performed by ministerial priests with true apostolic succession

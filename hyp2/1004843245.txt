in classical latin , the combination ae denotes the diphthong , which had a value similar to the long i in fine as pronounced in most dialects of modern english 3 both classical and present practice is to write the letters separately , but the ligature was used in medieval and early modern writings , in part because æ was reduced to the simple vowel during the roman empire however , the ligature is still relatively common in liturgical books and musical scores in the modern french alphabet , æ ( called '' a e-dans-l ’ a '' ) is used to spell latin and greek borrowings like curriculum vitæ , et cætera , ex æquo , tænia and the first name lætitia in modern typography , if technological limitations make the use of æ difficult ( such as in use of typewriters , telegraphs , or ascii ) , the digraph ae is often used instead in old english , æ represented a sound between a and e , very much like the short a of cat in many dialects of modern english in danish and norwegian , æ is a separate letter of the alphabet that represents a monophthong in western and southern jutish dialects of danish , is also the proclitic definite article : ( the house ) , as opposed to standard danish and all other nordic varieties which have enclitic definite articles ( danish , swedish , norwegian : , icelandic , faroese : ( the house ) ) the symbol is also used in the international phonetic alphabet to denote a near-open front unrounded vowel like in the word cat in many dialects of modern english , which is the sound that was most likely represented by the old english letter in all versions of the mac os ( systems 1 through 7 , mac os 8 and 9 , and the current os x ) , the following key combinations are used : æ : option + ' ( apostrophe key ) , æ : option + shift + '

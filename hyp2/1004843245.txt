in classical latin , the combination ae denotes the diphthong , which had a value similar to the long i in fine as pronounced in most dialects of modern english 3 both classical and present practice is to write the letters separately , but the ligature was used in medieval and early modern writings , in part because æ was reduced to the simple vowel during the roman empire in the modern french alphabet , æ ( called '' a e-dans-l ’ a '' ) is used to spell latin and greek borrowings like curriculum vitæ , et cætera , ex æquo , tænia and the first name lætitia in modern typography , if technological limitations make the use of æ difficult ( such as in use of typewriters , telegraphs , or ascii ) , the digraph ae is often used instead usage , however , may vary ; for example , medieval is now more common than mediaeval ( and the now old-fashioned mediæval ) even in the united kingdom , the spelling medieval is given priority in both oxford and cambridge advanced learner 's dictionary given their long history , ligatures are sometimes used to show archaism or in literal quotations of historic sources ; for instance , in those contexts , words such as dæmon and æther are often so spelled in old english , æ represented a sound between a and e , very much like the short a of cat in many dialects of modern english in danish and norwegian , æ is a separate letter of the alphabet that represents a monophthong the symbol is also used in the international phonetic alphabet to denote a near-open front unrounded vowel like in the word cat in many dialects of modern english , which is the sound that was most likely represented by the old english letter the norwegian keyboard layout also has a separate key for æ , rightmost of the letters , to the right of ø and below å

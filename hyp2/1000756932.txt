in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' two different irish language titles were used : and , based on two alternative irish translations of the word '' republic '' on the easter proclamation : and other declarations ( 1997 ) was a compound word , based on the irish words ( '' free '' ) and ( '' state '' ) was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire since then , the word has fallen out of use as a translation of '' republic '' after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as in 1916 , nationalist rebels participating in the easter rising issued the proclamation of the republic by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament the easter rising was short-lived , largely limited to dublin and , at the time it occurred , enjoyed little support from the irish general public in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party in the 1918 general election , candidates of the radical sinn féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement : '' sinn féin aims at securing the establishment of that republic '' sinn féin candidates won a large majority of the seats : 73 out of 105 , 25 of them uncontested on 21 january 1919 , 27 of them gathered in the mansion house in dublin to establish dáil éireann thirty-seven others were recorded as not being present , these were mainly from the northern six counties that would later form northern ireland '' history ireland , may 2007 , p.56 two further general elections called by the lord lieutenant of ireland , under the government of ireland act 1920 , the lord lieutenant of ireland was to be the chief executive of both northern ireland and southern ireland later , when southern ireland was replaced by the irish free state , the lord lieutenancy was abolished and replaced by a governor of northern ireland the head of the british dublin castle administration , were treated by nationalists as elections to the dáil the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty at its first meeting the dáil adopted a brief , provisional constitution known as the dáil constitution , as well as a series of basic laws , notably the democratic programme the dáil constitution vested executive authority in a cabinet called the ministry of dáil éireann ( or in irish ) initially , partly because of the division between republicans and monarchists , the irish republic had no head of state the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic arrangements were made in august 1920 for the volunteers to swear an oath of allegiance to the dáil british law allowed for the arbitration of disputes , provided the parties agreed to it , and as the dáil courts were initially described as arbitration panels it was impossible to outlaw them the enforcement of law and the decrees of the dáil courts was vested in the irish republican police the irish republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state ; a ministry ( with a head of state in the latter stages ) , a parliament , a courts system , a police force and a constitution in june 1920 , a '' draft treaty between the new russian soviet federative socialist republic and the republic of ireland '' was circulated in dublin 24 june–9 july 1921 '' this marked the end of the irish war of independence in january 1922 , a provisional government came into being , but the irish republic was not dismantled ; its institutions continued to operate in parallel with those of the provisional authority they failed in this goal , but the irish republic paved the way for the creation of the irish free state , a commonwealth dominion with self-government by 1937 , under a new constitution , the free state became a republic of ireland with the self-designation 'ireland ' nonetheless , a hard-line minority continued to reject the legitimacy of the free state and its successor , the republic of ireland

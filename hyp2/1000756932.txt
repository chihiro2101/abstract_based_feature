in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' two different irish language titles were used : and , based on two alternative irish translations of the word '' republic '' on the easter proclamation : and other declarations ( 1997 ) was a compound word , based on the irish words ( '' free '' ) and ( '' state '' ) was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament the easter rising was short-lived , largely limited to dublin and , at the time it occurred , enjoyed little support from the irish general public in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party a compromise was reached at the 1917 ard fheis ( party conference ) , where it was agreed that the party would pursue the establishment of an independent republic in the short term , until the irish people could be given the opportunity to decide on the form of government they preferred it also said it would boycott the british parliament and instead unilaterally establish a new irish assembly in dublin on 21 january 1919 , 27 of them gathered in the mansion house in dublin to establish dáil éireann thirty-seven others were recorded as not being present , these were mainly from the northern six counties that would later form northern ireland because of the easter proclamation of 1916 , the dáil retrospectively established the irish republic from easter 1916 on the same day as the declaration of independence was issued , two members of the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) escorting a cartload of gelignite were killed in the tipperary soloheadbeg ambush , carried out by members of the 3rd tipperary brigade of the irish volunteers , led by dan breen and seán treacy this ambush had not been ordered by the dáil , but the course of events soon drove the dáil to recognise the volunteers as the army of the irish republic , and so the soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared anglo-irish war between the volunteers and great britain '' history ireland , may 2007 , p.56 the central institution of the republic was dáil éireann , a unicameral assembly formed by the majority of irish members of parliament elected in the 1918 general election later , when southern ireland was replaced by the irish free state , the lord lieutenancy was abolished and replaced by a governor of northern ireland the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations this was to assert the claim that the negotiations were between two sovereign states ( ireland 's view ) , and not that it was between the british government and local politicians ( britain 's view ) after de valera 's resignation in january 1922 , his successors griffith and cosgrave called themselves '' president of dáil éireann '' the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic the more brutal the 'tans ' the more they alienated the local populace from the dublin castle administration and assize courts and the greater success the republican alternatives had the issue of recognition raises the question of how much the new dáil , particularly de valera , fully appreciated the developing relationship between the victorious powers following the war this allowed for two home rule irelands , partitioning ireland into northern ireland and southern ireland while rejecting the right of the british parliament to legislate for ireland , sinn féin took the opportunity of the two general elections in may 1921 , one in the north and one in the south , to seek a renewed mandate for the republic as a head of state he then accredited envoys plenipotentiary , an accreditation approved by the dáil both parliaments , the second dáil and the house of commons , were replaced by a joint parliament known variously as the third dáil or the provisional parliament , elected on 16 june 1922 on 6 december 1922 , the constitution of the irish free state came into effect and the institutions of both the irish republic and the provisional government ceased to exist by 1937 , under a new constitution , the free state became a republic of ireland with the self-designation 'ireland ' in particular the anti-treaty faction objected to the continued role in the irish constitution that would be granted to the british monarch under the irish free state volunteers of ireland ) , the official irish title for the irish defence forces

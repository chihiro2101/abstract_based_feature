in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' two different irish language titles were used : and , based on two alternative irish translations of the word '' republic '' on the easter proclamation : and other declarations ( 1997 ) was a compound word , based on the irish words ( '' free '' ) and ( '' state '' ) was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as winston churchill gives an account of the first meeting of éamon de valera with david lloyd george on 14 july 1921 , at which he was present by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament the easter rising was short-lived , largely limited to dublin and , at the time it occurred , enjoyed little support from the irish general public arthur griffith 's sinn féin organisation , which had favoured the establishment of a form of dual monarchy between ireland and britain , had not taken part in the rising in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party this agreement was subject to the condition that if the people chose monarchy , no member of the british royal family would be invited to serve as monarch in the 1918 general election , candidates of the radical sinn féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement : '' sinn féin aims at securing the establishment of that republic '' thirty-five other members were recorded as being ( imprisoned by the foreign enemy ) and another four as ( deported by the foreign enemy ) thirty-seven others were recorded as not being present , these were mainly from the northern six counties that would later form northern ireland because of the easter proclamation of 1916 , the dáil retrospectively established the irish republic from easter 1916 this ambush had not been ordered by the dáil , but the course of events soon drove the dáil to recognise the volunteers as the army of the irish republic , and so the soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared anglo-irish war between the volunteers and great britain the decision to establish a republic in 1919 , rather than any other form of government , was significant because it amounted to a complete repudiation of all constitutional ties with great britain , and set the party against any compromise that might involve initial self-government under the home rule act 1914 or continued membership of the british empire the central institution of the republic was dáil éireann , a unicameral assembly formed by the majority of irish members of parliament elected in the 1918 general election later , when southern ireland was replaced by the irish free state , the lord lieutenancy was abolished and replaced by a governor of northern ireland in august 1921 , it was changed again with the title president of the republic used , suggesting a position of head of state on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations this was to assert the claim that the negotiations were between two sovereign states ( ireland 's view ) , and not that it was between the british government and local politicians ( britain 's view ) after de valera 's resignation in january 1922 , his successors griffith and cosgrave called themselves '' president of dáil éireann '' despite being theoretically under the command of the dáil 's ministry , in practice individual ira columns enjoyed a high level of autonomy , subject to h.q the irish republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state ; a ministry ( with a head of state in the latter stages ) , a parliament , a courts system , a police force and a constitution but even after the truce of july 1921 , when the tans had stopped their activities , the continuing effectiveness of the dáil courts and police was seen to be patchy efforts by president de valera in the united states and by the republic 's '' ambassador '' at the versailles peace conference , seán t in declaring independence unilaterally for the whole island , the new republic had denied '' equal weight '' to the wishes of britain or the irish loyalists he had been invited as : '' the chosen leader of the great majority in southern ireland '' , but tried to extend this to a british recognition of the republic right by approving the anglo-irish treaty on 7 january 1922 and the constitution of the irish free state in october 1922 the dáil agreed to the replacement of the republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the irish free state on 6 december 1922 , the constitution of the irish free state came into effect and the institutions of both the irish republic and the provisional government ceased to exist the irish republican army ultimately ceased military operations against ireland in 1948 , but continued to consider itself the legitimate government of ireland the provisional irish republican army ( pira ) split with the original ira in december 1969 and afterward claimed that it was the sole legitimate representative of the irish republic

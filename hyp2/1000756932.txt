in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' two different irish language titles were used : and , based on two alternative irish translations of the word '' republic '' on the easter proclamation : and other declarations ( 1997 ) was a compound word , based on the irish words ( '' free '' ) and ( '' state '' ) was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as winston churchill gives an account of the first meeting of éamon de valera with david lloyd george on 14 july 1921 , at which he was present lloyd george was a native speaker of welsh and a noted welsh linguist , and as such was interested in the literal meaning of 'saorstát ' by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament arthur griffith 's sinn féin organisation , which had favoured the establishment of a form of dual monarchy between ireland and britain , had not taken part in the rising in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party on 21 january 1919 , 27 of them gathered in the mansion house in dublin to establish dáil éireann thirty-seven others were recorded as not being present , these were mainly from the northern six counties that would later form northern ireland this ambush had not been ordered by the dáil , but the course of events soon drove the dáil to recognise the volunteers as the army of the irish republic , and so the soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared anglo-irish war between the volunteers and great britain one obstacle to this decision—that the unionists of the north-east had long indicated that they would never participate in any form of a republic—was left unresolved , the six north-eastern counties remaining part of the united kingdom under the government of ireland act 1920 , and later the anglo-irish treaty two further general elections called by the lord lieutenant of ireland , under the government of ireland act 1920 , the lord lieutenant of ireland was to be the chief executive of both northern ireland and southern ireland the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty the dáil constitution vested executive authority in a cabinet called the ministry of dáil éireann ( or in irish ) according to the original version of the constitution enacted in january 1919 , there were to be four ministers : : minister of finance : minister of home affairs : minister of foreign affairs : minister of national defence in april 1919 , the ministry was increased in size to not more than nine ministers the republic 's leader was known initially as the , literally '' prime minister '' but referred to in the english version of the constitution as '' president of the ministry '' later the english title '' president of dáil éireann '' also came to be used for the same post , especially during president de valera 's tour of the united states on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations this was to assert the claim that the negotiations were between two sovereign states ( ireland 's view ) , and not that it was between the british government and local politicians ( britain 's view ) despite being theoretically under the command of the dáil 's ministry , in practice individual ira columns enjoyed a high level of autonomy , subject to h.q but even after the truce of july 1921 , when the tans had stopped their activities , the continuing effectiveness of the dáil courts and police was seen to be patchy this was in part due to standing down the royal irish constabulary ( ric ) in early 1922 before a new police force was ready to operate ; in the interim the irish republican army ( ira ) , dividing within itself over the treaty , was the only police force because its original contents were not seen as workable , the government under david lloyd george abandoned plans to amend the third home rule act enacted in 1914 , having called the irish convention in 1917–18 this accreditation gave them the legal ability to sign a treaty without waiting for approval from the republic 's cabinet , some of whose members were among the envoys right by approving the anglo-irish treaty on 7 january 1922 and the constitution of the irish free state in october 1922 the dáil agreed to the replacement of the republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the irish free state in january 1922 , a provisional government came into being , but the irish republic was not dismantled ; its institutions continued to operate in parallel with those of the provisional authority the principle of an all-island republic remains a central aspiration of at least three of the politics in the republic of ireland ( fianna fáil , fine gael and sinn féin ) and of two of the politics of northern ireland ( sinn féin and the sdlp ) the civil war began in june 1922 when both sinn féin and the ira split between those pragmatists , who supported the treaty , and the hardline republicans who opposed the compromises it contained in march 1926 , de valera , along with most anti-treaty politicians , founded a new party called fianna fáil and ended their boycott of the institutions of the free state the irish republican army ultimately ceased military operations against ireland in 1948 , but continued to consider itself the legitimate government of ireland

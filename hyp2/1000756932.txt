in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' two different irish language titles were used : and , based on two alternative irish translations of the word '' republic '' on the easter proclamation : and other declarations ( 1997 ) was a compound word , based on the irish words ( '' free '' ) and ( '' state '' ) was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as in 1916 , nationalist rebels participating in the easter rising issued the proclamation of the republic by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament the easter rising was short-lived , largely limited to dublin and , at the time it occurred , enjoyed little support from the irish general public the leaders of the easter rising had proclaimed a republic in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party a compromise was reached at the 1917 ard fheis ( party conference ) , where it was agreed that the party would pursue the establishment of an independent republic in the short term , until the irish people could be given the opportunity to decide on the form of government they preferred in the 1918 general election , candidates of the radical sinn féin party—including many who had participated in the 1916 rebellion—issued a manifesto which included the statement : '' sinn féin aims at securing the establishment of that republic '' at this meeting the dáil adopted the irish declaration of independence because of the easter proclamation of 1916 , the dáil retrospectively established the irish republic from easter 1916 '' history ireland , may 2007 , p.56 the central institution of the republic was dáil éireann , a unicameral assembly formed by the majority of irish members of parliament elected in the 1918 general election two further general elections called by the lord lieutenant of ireland , under the government of ireland act 1920 , the lord lieutenant of ireland was to be the chief executive of both northern ireland and southern ireland later , when southern ireland was replaced by the irish free state , the lord lieutenancy was abolished and replaced by a governor of northern ireland at its first meeting the dáil adopted a brief , provisional constitution known as the dáil constitution , as well as a series of basic laws , notably the democratic programme on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations this was to assert the claim that the negotiations were between two sovereign states ( ireland 's view ) , and not that it was between the british government and local politicians ( britain 's view ) the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic arrangements were made in august 1920 for the volunteers to swear an oath of allegiance to the dáil they proved unable to deal with violent crimes but acquired a good reputation with farmers , particularly in dealing harshly with cases of cattle rustling the enforcement of law and the decrees of the dáil courts was vested in the irish republican police the irish republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state ; a ministry ( with a head of state in the latter stages ) , a parliament , a courts system , a police force and a constitution the extent to which these functioned fluctuated in different parts of the island , with the success or otherwise of republican institutions depending both on the degree of control of the ira in the region and on the brutality of the black and tans and auxiliaries , active from june 1920 to july 1921 the british cabinet started in september 1919 to work from walter long 's 1918 proposals , and in december 1920 they enacted the government of ireland act 1920 this allowed for two home rule irelands , partitioning ireland into northern ireland and southern ireland right by approving the anglo-irish treaty on 7 january 1922 and the constitution of the irish free state in october 1922 the dáil agreed to the replacement of the republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the irish free state in january 1922 , a provisional government came into being , but the irish republic was not dismantled ; its institutions continued to operate in parallel with those of the provisional authority '' opponents of the treaty refused to recognise either the provisional government or , when it was established , the irish free state , insisting that the irish republic continued to exist as a entity volunteers of ireland ) , the official irish title for the irish defence forces

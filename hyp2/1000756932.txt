in english , the revolutionary state was to be known as the '' irish republic '' two different irish language titles were used : and , based on two alternative irish translations of the word '' republic '' on the easter proclamation : and other declarations ( 1997 ) was a compound word , based on the irish words ( '' free '' ) and ( '' state '' ) was adopted as the official irish title of the irish free state when it was established at the end of the irish war of independence , although this free state was not a republic but a form of constitutional monarchy within the british empire after the irish state had changed its name to '' ireland '' , in 1949 the description of the state was declared '' republic of ireland '' , while in irish it was translated as winston churchill gives an account of the first meeting of éamon de valera with david lloyd george on 14 july 1921 , at which he was present lloyd george was a native speaker of welsh and a noted welsh linguist , and as such was interested in the literal meaning of 'saorstát ' de valera replied that it meant 'free state ' by this declaration they claimed to establish an independent state called the '' irish republic '' and proclaimed that the leaders of the rebellion would serve as the '' provisional government of the irish republic '' until it became possible to elect a national parliament the easter rising was short-lived , largely limited to dublin and , at the time it occurred , enjoyed little support from the irish general public arthur griffith 's sinn féin organisation , which had favoured the establishment of a form of dual monarchy between ireland and britain , had not taken part in the rising in 1917 , griffith 's sinn féin and republicans under éamon de valera came together to form the new sinn féin party it also said it would boycott the british parliament and instead unilaterally establish a new irish assembly in dublin on 21 january 1919 , 27 of them gathered in the mansion house in dublin to establish dáil éireann at this meeting the dáil adopted the irish declaration of independence this ambush had not been ordered by the dáil , but the course of events soon drove the dáil to recognise the volunteers as the army of the irish republic , and so the soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared anglo-irish war between the volunteers and great britain breen later recalled : '' treacy had stated to me that the only way of starting a war was to kill someone , so we intended to kill some of the police the central institution of the republic was dáil éireann , a unicameral assembly formed by the majority of irish members of parliament elected in the 1918 general election two further general elections called by the lord lieutenant of ireland , under the government of ireland act 1920 , the lord lieutenant of ireland was to be the chief executive of both northern ireland and southern ireland later , when southern ireland was replaced by the irish free state , the lord lieutenancy was abolished and replaced by a governor of northern ireland the second dáil comprised members returned in the 1921 elections for the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland ; the third dáil was elected at the 1922 general election as the '' provisional parliament '' of '' southern ireland '' , as provided for by the anglo-irish treaty the dáil constitution vested executive authority in a cabinet called the ministry of dáil éireann ( or in irish ) the ministry was answerable to the dáil which elected its head , known initially as the president of dáil éireann in august 1921 , it was changed again with the title president of the republic used , suggesting a position of head of state on 26 august 1921 , de valera had the dáil appoint him to the new post of '' president of the republic '' , so that he would be regarded as the head of state in the forthcoming treaty negotiations the military branch of the irish republic were the irish volunteers who , in the course of the war of independence , who were formally renamed the '' irish republican army '' to reflect their status as the national army of the declared republic in other cases the dáil courts proved more popular because of the speed and efficiency of their functioning , compared to the local assize courts the enforcement of law and the decrees of the dáil courts was vested in the irish republican police the irish republic had some of the attributes of a functioning state ; a ministry ( with a head of state in the latter stages ) , a parliament , a courts system , a police force and a constitution this allowed for two home rule irelands , partitioning ireland into northern ireland and southern ireland right by approving the anglo-irish treaty on 7 january 1922 and the constitution of the irish free state in october 1922 the dáil agreed to the replacement of the republic with the system of constitutional monarchy of the irish free state the goal of those who established the irish republic was to create an independent republic comprising the whole island of ireland in particular the anti-treaty faction objected to the continued role in the irish constitution that would be granted to the british monarch under the irish free state

the entry in the general stud book simply states : '' byerly turk , was captain byerly 's charger in ireland , in king william 's wars ( 1689 , & c 389 as for his earlier history , the most popular theory is that the horse was captured at the battle of buda ( 1686 ) along with the lister turk , who was brought to england by the duke of berwick he was definitely the war horse of captain robert byerley , who was dispatched to ireland in 1689 during king william 's war and saw further military service in the battle of the boyne according to early records , captain byerley was nearly captured while reconnoitering the enemy , '' owing his safety to the superior speed of his horse '' however , the original edition of the general stud book was compiled nearly a century after the fact ( in 1791 ) and contains several errors that have been subsequently corrected most sources consider the correct spelling of the horse 's name to follow the correct spelling of the owner 's name , byerley the byerley turk was a dark brown or black horse of unknown breeding , but described in historic accounts as an arabian after byerley retired ( as colonel byerley ) , the byerley turk retired to stud , first at middridge grange , then , from 1697 , at goldsborough hall 1701 , a bay colt of middling ability who became the sire of partner , a four-time leading sire partner sired tartar , who was the sire of herod ( 1738 ) the byerley turk also sired several highly influential daughters , most of whose names do not survive byerley turk sire line unfortunately , cirrus des aigles was gelded so the my babu sire line is on the brink of extinction another son of ahonoora , inchinor , sired notnowcato in 2002 thus the continuation of the byerley turk thoroughbred sire line via herod now largely depends on the descendants of ahonoora , several of whom are at stud in europe therefore , the byerley turk overall sire line lives on today more prominently through the american saddlebred and morgan horse than the thoroughbred

transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the earth 's surface the new class of faults , called transform faults , produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates ; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers this hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest transform faults are closely related to transcurrent faults and are commonly confused both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault finally , transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary , while transcurrent faults do not transform faults specifically accommodate lateral strain by transferring displacement between mid-ocean ridges or subduction zones transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge wilson described six types of transform faults : growing length : in situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked , the transform fault itself will grow in length the san andreas fault links the east pacific rise off the west coast of mexico ( gulf of california ) to the mendocino triple junction ( part of the juan de fuca plate ) off the coast of the northwestern united states , making it a ridge-to-transform-style fault other examples include : middle east 's dead sea transform fault pakistan 's chaman fault turkey 's north anatolian fault north america 's queen charlotte fault myanmar 's sagaing fault

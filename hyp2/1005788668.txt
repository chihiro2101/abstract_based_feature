slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates ; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers . difference between transform and transcurrent faults both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault finally , transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary , while transcurrent faults do not transform faults specifically accommodate lateral strain by transferring displacement between mid-ocean ridges or subduction zones transform faults and divergent boundaries transform faults are commonly found linking segments of divergent boundaries ( mid-oceanic ridges or spreading centres ) transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge as this takes place , the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a strike-slip fault with lateral stress in time as the plates are subducted , the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely , leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions in new zealand , the south island 's alpine fault is a transform fault for much of its length other examples include : middle east 's dead sea transform fault pakistan 's chaman fault turkey 's north anatolian fault north america 's queen charlotte fault myanmar 's sagaing fault

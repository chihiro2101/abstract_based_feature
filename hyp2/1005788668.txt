transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the earth 's surface the new class of faults , called transform faults , produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature this hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault finally , transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary , while transcurrent faults do not transform faults specifically accommodate lateral strain by transferring displacement between mid-ocean ridges or subduction zones transform faults are commonly found linking segments of divergent boundaries ( mid-oceanic ridges or spreading centres ) transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge instead of the ridges moving away from each other , as they do in other strike-slip faults , transform-fault ridges remain in the same , fixed locations , and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge these length changes are dependent on which type of fault or tectonic structure connect with the transform fault these occur when two descending subduction plates are linked by a transform fault in new zealand , the south island 's alpine fault is a transform fault for much of its length

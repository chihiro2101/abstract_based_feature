transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the earth 's surface the new class of faults , called transform faults , produce slip in the opposite direction from what one would surmise from the standard interpretation of an offset geological feature slip along transform faults does not increase the distance between the ridges it separates ; the distance remains constant in earthquakes because the ridges are spreading centers this hypothesis was confirmed in a study of the fault plane solutions that showed the slip on transform faults points in the opposite direction than classical interpretation would suggest mechanism of earthquakes and nature of faulting on the mid-oceanic ridges , journal of geophysical research , 72 , 5â€“27 both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge instead of the ridges moving away from each other , as they do in other strike-slip faults , transform-fault ridges remain in the same , fixed locations , and the new ocean seafloor created at the ridges is pushed away from the ridge a paper written by geophysicist taras gerya theorizes that the creation of the transform faults between the ridges of the mid-oceanic ridge is attributed to rotated and stretched sections of the mid-oceanic ridge wilson described six types of transform faults : growing length : in situations where a transform fault links a spreading center and the upper block of a subduction zone or where two upper blocks of subduction zones are linked , the transform fault itself will grow in length in time as the plates are subducted , the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely , leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions other examples include : middle east 's dead sea transform fault pakistan 's chaman fault turkey 's north anatolian fault north america 's queen charlotte fault myanmar 's sagaing fault

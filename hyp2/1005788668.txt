transform boundaries are also known as conservative plate boundaries because they involve no addition or loss of lithosphere at the earth 's surface in the california earthquake of april 18 , 1906 , report of the state earthquake investigation commission , carnegie institution of washington , washington d.c both types of fault are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement ; nevertheless , transform faults always end at a junction with another plate boundary , while transcurrent faults may die out without a junction with another fault finally , transform faults form a tectonic plate boundary , while transcurrent faults do not faults in general are focused areas of deformation or strain , which are the response of built-up stresses in the form of compression , tension , or shear stress in rock at the surface or deep in the earth 's subsurface transform faults are commonly found linking segments of divergent boundaries ( mid-oceanic ridges or spreading centres ) this lateral movement of seafloors past each other is where transform faults are currently active transform faults move differently from a strike-slip fault at the mid-oceanic ridge as this takes place , the fault changes from a normal fault with extensional stress to a strike-slip fault with lateral stress these length changes are dependent on which type of fault or tectonic structure connect with the transform fault in time as the plates are subducted , the transform fault will decrease in length until the transform fault disappears completely , leaving only two subduction zones facing in opposite directions other examples include : middle east 's dead sea transform fault pakistan 's chaman fault turkey 's north anatolian fault north america 's queen charlotte fault myanmar 's sagaing fault

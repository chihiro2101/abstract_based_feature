it was soon after incorporated into the middle east wild internet server ( mewis ) and other smaller servers before being implemented at chess live and internet chess club in 2000 , free internet chess server in 2003 and lichess in 2015 rules of atomic chess are the same as standard chess with a few important differences concerning capturing , check , and winning conditions in standard chess , the captured piece is removed from the board and the capturing piece takes its place in atomic chess , a capture causes an '' explosion '' through which both pieces are removed from the board as well as all non-pawn pieces in the eight squares immediately surrounding the capture captures that result in the explosion of a player 's own king are illegal , and therefore a king can never capture any other piece as the king can not take another piece , it is possible to move the kings next to each other without a check occurring or to escape check at other times , a player can counter by forcing a win with a position such that a piece or pawn can be exploded next to their opponent 's king without blowing up their own king , or by forcing the opposing king away using their king and the remaining pieces on the board , which typically will result in a loss for the retreating king the variant of atomic chess played at the internet chess club is one that does not enforce check at all , making legal any move , even one leaving the king to be captured directly in the next move in these variations without check , the king may be forced into check and thus capture through zugzwang the internet chess club variation of atomic chess ignores check completely , and thus leads to different outcomes in certain situations

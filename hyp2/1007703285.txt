virtual economies are observed in muds and mmorpg ( mmorpgs ) virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world virtual property is a label that can refer to any resource that is controlled by the powers-that-be , including virtual objects , avatars , or user accounts the following characteristics may be found in virtual resources in mimicry of tangible property rivalry : possession of a resource is limited to one person or a small number of persons within the virtual world 's game mechanics value added by users : users may enhance the value of virtual resources by customizing and improving upon the resource therefore , economic theory can often be used to study these virtual worlds real money commerce in a virtual market has grown to become a multibillion-dollar industry in 2001 , everquest players brock pierce and alan debonneville founded internet gaming entertainment ltd ( ige ) , a company that offered not only the virtual commodities in exchange for real money but also provided professional customer service this lucrative market has opened a whole new type of economy where the border between the real and the virtual is obscure hundreds of companies are enormously successful in this new found market , with some virtual items being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars some of these companies sell multiple virtual goods for multiple games , and others sell services for single games virtual real estate is earning real world money , with people like 43-year-old wonder bread deliveryman , john dugger , purchasing a virtual real estate for 750 , setting him back more than a weeks wages such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere although virtual markets may represent a growth area , it is unclear to what extent they can scale to supporting large numbers of businesses , due to the inherent substitutability of goods on these markets plus the lack of factors such as location to dispense demand in spite of numerous famed examples of the economic growth of second life an amateur analyst in 2008 estimated the income inequity in second life 's economy as worse than has ever been recorded in any real economy : a gini coefficient of 90.2 , a hoover index of 77.8 , and a theil index of 91 % however , the application of these economic measures to a virtual world may be inappropriate where poverty is merely virtual and there is a direct relationship between in-game wealth and time spent playing the global secondary market - defined as real money trading between players - turnover was estimated at 880 million dollars in 2005 by the president of the , at the time , market leading company ige a speculative extrapolation based on these quotes and other industry figures produced a global turnover figure of 2 billion dollars as of 2007 also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland china targeting the global secondary market for example , south korea is estimated to have the biggest share of the global real money trading market and it has there become an officially acknowledged and taxable part of the economy types of virtual currencies many online games , particularly those that use the freemium model , offer at least one additional form of currency beyond its standard one , called premium currency this practice tends to encourage the player to buy additional bundles as to minimize their leftover premium currency , a favorable practice for the publisher team fortress 2 , a team-based online fps released by valve in 2007 , is a hero shooter , where players selected from one of several created characters to control hats could be earned by players by accumulating in-game material drops and then used to synthesis the hat , or later could be purchased directly using real-world currency through the game 's storefront this created a virtual economy around the game , as certain customization items carried status and recognition , giving them a perceived social value status this created a virtual economy around items in the game , as some rare items , known as '' unusuals '' by the game community due to various special effects applied , and are seen as having high social value , had traded for as high as , and because of the active trading that incorporated real-world money , valve hired economist yanis varoufakis to help manage this as with team fortress 2 skins , these counter-strike skins gained value as status symbols among players coupled with the rarity of certain skins , and became highly valued , and was considered to help boost the popularity of the game while some of these websites were taken off line for various reasons , valve was pressured to prevent abuse of the skin trading systems on steam this economy may also mix with real-world currency , with players trading in-game items through external websites to the game eve online is a prime example of online game with a vast player-driven economy that , in 2014 , was estimated to have a total virtual value of based on the trading of the in-game currency player-driven economies have led to immaterial labor activities , such as gold farming in world of warcraft , where some players are paid in real-world funds to spend the time to acquire in-game wealth for other players being able to exchange real money for virtual currency provides the player purchasing power for virtual commodities however , there are significant legal and practical challenges to the taxation of income from the sale of virtual property however , for policy reasons , many commentators support some form of a '' cash out '' rule that would prevent in-game transactions from generating tax liabilities while many game developers , such as blizzard ( creator of world of warcraft ) , prohibit the practice , it is common that goods and services within virtual economies will be sold on online auction sites and traded for real currencies further and more involved issues revolve around the issue of how ( or if ) real-money trading subjects the virtual economy to laws relating to the real economy

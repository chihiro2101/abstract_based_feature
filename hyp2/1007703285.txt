virtual economies are observed in muds and mmorpg ( mmorpgs ) the largest virtual economies are found in mmorpgs virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world this can be seen , for example , in second life 's recognition of intellectual property rights for assets created '' in-world '' by subscribers , and its laissez-faire policy on the buying and selling of linden dollars ( the world 's official currency ) for real money on third party websites virtual economies can also exist in browser-based internet games where '' real '' money can be spent and user-created shops opened , or as a kind of emergent gameplay virtual property is a label that can refer to any resource that is controlled by the powers-that-be , including virtual objects , avatars , or user accounts rivalry : possession of a resource is limited to one person or a small number of persons within the virtual world 's game mechanics secondary markets : virtual resources may be created , traded , bought , and sold the existence of these conditions create an economic system with properties similar to those seen in contemporary economy within the virtual worlds they inhabit , synthetic economies allow in-game items to be priced according to supply and demand rather than by the developer 's estimate of the item 's utility the release of blizzard entertainment 's world of warcraft in 2004 and its subsequent huge success across the globe has forced both mmorpgs and their secondary markets into mainstream consciousness , and many new market places have opened up during this time real money commerce in a virtual market has grown to become a multibillion-dollar industry hundreds of companies are enormously successful in this new found market , with some virtual items being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars dugger represents a group of gamers that are not in the market for a real house but instead to own a small piece of the vast computer database that was ultima online , the mythical world in which the venerable mmo ultima online unfolds such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere although virtual markets may represent a growth area , it is unclear to what extent they can scale to supporting large numbers of businesses , due to the inherent substitutability of goods on these markets plus the lack of factors such as location to dispense demand however , the application of these economic measures to a virtual world may be inappropriate where poverty is merely virtual and there is a direct relationship between in-game wealth and time spent playing the global secondary market - defined as real money trading between players - turnover was estimated at 880 million dollars in 2005 by the president of the , at the time , market leading company ige however , the secondary market is unlikely to have followed the growth of the primary market since 2007 seeing as game companies have become better at monetizing on their games with microtransactions and many popular games such as world of warcraft are sporting increased measures against player to player real money trading also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland china targeting the global secondary market however , being a largely unregulated market and tax free market , any turnover figure or economic model remain speculative premium currency can not typically be earned in-game like common currency but instead by purchasing the premium currency using real-world funds premium currency typically is limited to purchase time-limited virtual goods , access to new characters or levels , temporary boosts to the player-character 's experience growth , or other goods that can not be acquired with the common in-game currency once premium currency is purchased , it is rare for players to be able to revert the premium currency , or the goods purchased with it , back into real-world funds , making it a '' one-way currency '' most commonly , premium currency must be purchased through microtransactions in bundles of fixed sizes with discounts for larger purchases , and do not allow players to purchase exactly the amount of premium currency they need for a virtual good this created a virtual economy around the game , as certain customization items carried status and recognition , giving them a perceived social value status this economy may also mix with real-world currency , with players trading in-game items through external websites to the game eve online is a prime example of online game with a vast player-driven economy that , in 2014 , was estimated to have a total virtual value of based on the trading of the in-game currency player-driven economies have led to immaterial labor activities , such as gold farming in world of warcraft , where some players are paid in real-world funds to spend the time to acquire in-game wealth for other players information brokerages and other tools that aid in the valuation of virtual items on secondary markets have increased in number being able to exchange real money for virtual currency provides the player purchasing power for virtual commodities most scholars agree that the sale of virtual property for real currency or assets is taxable as with the above skin gambling concerns , conversion between in-game and real-world currency has led to direct comparisons with other online games of chance as 'virtual winnings ' diablo iii has its virtual economy as well which is represented by online game auction a game 's synthetic economy often results in interaction with a '' real '' economy ; characters , currency , and items may be sold and bought on online auction websites or purchased from standalone webshops according to standard conceptions of economic value ( see the economic subjectivism ) , the goods and services of virtual economies do have a demonstrable value other virtual world developers officially sell virtual items and currency for real-world money further and more involved issues revolve around the issue of how ( or if ) real-money trading subjects the virtual economy to laws relating to the real economy

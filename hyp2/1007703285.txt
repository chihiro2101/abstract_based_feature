virtual economies are observed in muds and mmorpg ( mmorpgs ) virtual economies also exist in life simulation games which may have taken the most radical steps toward linking a virtual economy with the real world this can be seen , for example , in second life 's recognition of intellectual property rights for assets created '' in-world '' by subscribers , and its laissez-faire policy on the buying and selling of linden dollars ( the world 's official currency ) for real money on third party websites virtual economies can also exist in browser-based internet games where '' real '' money can be spent and user-created shops opened , or as a kind of emergent gameplay virtual property is a label that can refer to any resource that is controlled by the powers-that-be , including virtual objects , avatars , or user accounts note however that it is possible for virtual resources to lack one or more of these characteristics , and they should be interpreted with reasonable flexibility rivalry : possession of a resource is limited to one person or a small number of persons within the virtual world 's game mechanics secondary markets : virtual resources may be created , traded , bought , and sold within the virtual worlds they inhabit , synthetic economies allow in-game items to be priced according to supply and demand rather than by the developer 's estimate of the item 's utility these currencies are often sold for real world profit ige had a trained staff that would handle financial issues , customer inquiries and technical support to ensure that gamers are satisfied with each real money purchase this lucrative market has opened a whole new type of economy where the border between the real and the virtual is obscure dugger represents a group of gamers that are not in the market for a real house but instead to own a small piece of the vast computer database that was ultima online , the mythical world in which the venerable mmo ultima online unfolds such trading of real money for virtual goods simply represents the development of virtual economies where people come together where the real and the synthetic worlds are meeting within an economic sphere although virtual markets may represent a growth area , it is unclear to what extent they can scale to supporting large numbers of businesses , due to the inherent substitutability of goods on these markets plus the lack of factors such as location to dispense demand however , the application of these economic measures to a virtual world may be inappropriate where poverty is merely virtual and there is a direct relationship between in-game wealth and time spent playing also hampering the turnover growth are the extreme price drops that has followed the increased competition from businesses in mainland china targeting the global secondary market furthermore , the global decline in consumption that followed the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 would have affected the secondary market negatively as well in western countries the secondary market remains a black market with little to no social acceptance or official acknowledgement as for an actual economic model , secondary market turnover in popular player vs player oriented mmorpgs without trade restrictions such as runescape , eve online and ultima online has been estimated at around 1.1 dollar per concurrent player and day many games , both online and off , use a common or standard type of currency that can only be earned in-game and used to spend on in-game items that can not be traded with other players or converted to real-world funds ; for example , by completing quests in world of warcraft , players earn gold pieces that are used to purchase new gear many online games , particularly those that use the freemium model , offer at least one additional form of currency beyond its standard one , called premium currency premium currency typically is limited to purchase time-limited virtual goods , access to new characters or levels , temporary boosts to the player-character 's experience growth , or other goods that can not be acquired with the common in-game currency most commonly , premium currency must be purchased through microtransactions in bundles of fixed sizes with discounts for larger purchases , and do not allow players to purchase exactly the amount of premium currency they need for a virtual good this practice tends to encourage the player to buy additional bundles as to minimize their leftover premium currency , a favorable practice for the publisher in 2009 , valve introduced hats , virtual goods that could be used to customize the character models hats could be earned by players by accumulating in-game material drops and then used to synthesis the hat , or later could be purchased directly using real-world currency through the game 's storefront this created a virtual economy around the game , as certain customization items carried status and recognition , giving them a perceived social value status some games may have currency systems that are partially or fully controlled by players of the game this economy may also mix with real-world currency , with players trading in-game items through external websites to the game eve online is a prime example of online game with a vast player-driven economy that , in 2014 , was estimated to have a total virtual value of based on the trading of the in-game currency player-driven economies have led to immaterial labor activities , such as gold farming in world of warcraft , where some players are paid in real-world funds to spend the time to acquire in-game wealth for other players most scholars agree that the sale of virtual property for real currency or assets is taxable however , there are significant legal and practical challenges to the taxation of income from the sale of virtual property a game 's synthetic economy often results in interaction with a '' real '' economy ; characters , currency , and items may be sold and bought on online auction websites or purchased from standalone webshops since january 2007 users are no longer allowed to sell virtual goods of online games on ebay due to the ambiguous legal status of real world trading the '' real money auction house '' ( rmah ) , as it is called by the diablo iii fanbase , will exist in the presence of a parallel auction house wherein items are exchanged for gold , the in-game currency other virtual world developers officially sell virtual items and currency for real-world money

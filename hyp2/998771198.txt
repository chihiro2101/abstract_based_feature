they are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis the leaves are then close together in rosettes , and cover the lower areas of the leaves , forming a funnel for collecting water geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) these leaf rosettes , a common physical characteristic in tillandsia species , collect nutrients and water an air plant 's foliage may also change color when it blooms , also attracting pollinators but there are also species that live lithophytic , so on rocks ( but also roofs and even telephone wires ) since tillandsia are not self-fertile , the pollen must come from another plant of the same species tillandsia , depending on the species , may take months or years to flower elvira groß : tillandsia for room and conservatory ulmer , stuttgart 2001 , generally , the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought ( ) air plants are growing rapidly in popularity as a low maintenance household plant wolfgang kawollek : tillandsien – species and culture any root system found on tillandsia has grown to act as a fragile stabilizing scaffold to grip the surface they grow on geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) anoplophytum ( beer ) baker tillandsia subg file : tillandsia regnellii.jpg alt tillandsia regnellii brazil tillandsia regnellii brazil file : tillandsia kautskyi var2.jpg tillandsia kautskyi

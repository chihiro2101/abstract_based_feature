they are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis the leaves are then close together in rosettes , and cover the lower areas of the leaves , forming a funnel for collecting water geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) these leaf rosettes , a common physical characteristic in tillandsia species , collect nutrients and water an air plant 's foliage may also change color when it blooms , also attracting pollinators the seeds have a '' parachute '' similar to the dandelion but there are also species that live lithophytic , so on rocks ( but also roofs and even telephone wires ) ( ) in contrast , almost all gray species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity they prefer the full sun and can therefore be found in the upper floors of the woods , on rocks or ( rarely ) on the ground many of the gray species are epiphytes most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain , dew , dust , decaying leaves and insect matter , aided by structures called trichomes they do not have a functional root system and instead absorb water in small amounts through their leaves via small structures called trichomes the genus contains around 650 species , where 635 are considered epiphytic mendoza , c geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) tillandsia four species are protected under cites ii : tillandsia harrisii tillandsia kammii tillandsia mauryana tillandsia xerographica file : tillandsia schiedeana mhnt.bot.2007.40.37.jpg seeds of tillandsia schiedeana â€“ mhnt file : t_ionantha_bloom.jpg tillandsia ionantha in bloom

they are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis the leaves are then close together in rosettes , and cover the lower areas of the leaves , forming a funnel for collecting water geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) these leaf rosettes , a common physical characteristic in tillandsia species , collect nutrients and water the flower 's color varies greatly ; red , yellow , purple and pink flowers exist in this genus , and multicolored flowers are known an air plant 's foliage may also change color when it blooms , also attracting pollinators the green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests ( ) in contrast , almost all gray species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity many of the gray species are epiphytes since tillandsia are not self-fertile , the pollen must come from another plant of the same species after flowering , the plant forms offsets and dies ulmer , stuttgart 2001 , generally , the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought species of tillandsia also absorb their nutrients from debris and dust in the air geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) tillandsia four species are protected under cites ii : tillandsia harrisii tillandsia kammii tillandsia mauryana tillandsia xerographica file : 空氣鳳梨 20190409105748.jpg tillandsia

they are perennial herbaceous plants which exhibit a multitude of physiological and morphological differences making this a diverse genus having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis the leaves are then close together in rosettes , and cover the lower areas of the leaves , forming a funnel for collecting water geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) these leaf rosettes , a common physical characteristic in tillandsia species , collect nutrients and water an air plant 's foliage may also change color when it blooms , also attracting pollinators the green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests rauh werner ( 1970 vol.1 , 1973 , vol.2 ) ; bromelien , verlag eugen ulmer , stuttgart ( ) in contrast , almost all gray species live in precipitation-poor areas with high humidity they prefer the full sun and can therefore be found in the upper floors of the woods , on rocks or ( rarely ) on the ground tillandsia , depending on the species , may take months or years to flower after flowering , the plant forms offsets and dies most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain , dew , dust , decaying leaves and insect matter , aided by structures called trichomes diaphoranthema ( beer ) baker tillandsia subg file : tillandsia schiedeana mhnt.bot.2007.40.37.jpg seeds of tillandsia schiedeana – mhnt file : t_ionantha_bloom.jpg tillandsia ionantha in bloom file : 空氣鳳梨 20190409105943.jpg tillandsia file : tillandsia regnellii.jpg alt tillandsia regnellii brazil tillandsia regnellii brazil file : tillandsia kautskyi var2.jpg tillandsia kautskyi

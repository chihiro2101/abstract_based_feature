having native habitats that vary from being epiphytic and saxicolous , species have certain adaptations , such as root systems designed to anchor to other plants or substrates , and modified trichomes for water and nutrient intake some of the species , like the majority of bromeliaceae , grow as funnel bromeliads , with a compressed stem axis the leaves are then close together in rosettes , and cover the lower areas of the leaves , forming a funnel for collecting water geographic structure in two highly diverse lineages of tillandsia ( bromeliaceae ) these leaf rosettes , a common physical characteristic in tillandsia species , collect nutrients and water the flowers typically involve bright , vibrant colors , with blooms or inflorescence produced on a stalk or several stalks steens andrew ( 2003 ) ; bromeliads for the contemporary garden , timber press , portland , usa an air plant 's foliage may also change color when it blooms , also attracting pollinators common pollinators of this genera include moths , hummingbirds and , more recently recognized , bats but there are also species that live lithophytic , so on rocks ( but also roofs and even telephone wires ) the green species with their claim to a cool-humid climate live mostly more in the shade terrestrial or in the lower levels of the forests tillandsia , depending on the species , may take months or years to flower most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain , dew , dust , decaying leaves and insect matter , aided by structures called trichomes ( ) air plants are growing rapidly in popularity as a low maintenance household plant tillandsia four species are protected under cites ii : tillandsia harrisii tillandsia kammii tillandsia mauryana tillandsia xerographica file : tillandsia schiedeana mhnt.bot.2007.40.37.jpg seeds of tillandsia schiedeana – mhnt file : t_ionantha_bloom.jpg tillandsia ionantha in bloom file : 空氣鳳梨 20190409105920.jpg tillandsia file : 空氣鳳梨 20190409105943.jpg tillandsia

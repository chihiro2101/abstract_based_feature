first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits the view of expressive aphasia as an expressive disorder is supported by its frequent co-occurrence with facial motor difficulties , and its anatomical localization although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions , it is most commonly associated with the inferior frontal gyrus , a region that overlaps with motor cortex controlling the mouth and tongue , extending into the periventricular white matter lesions exclusively to broca 's area ( the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus ) do not produce broca 's aphasia , but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia , sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria receptive aphasia was originally described by the german neurologist karl wernicke , a contemporary of broca a fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language , who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to expressive and receptive aphasias in hearing populations these studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of broca 's area and the semantic functions of wernicke 's area are indeed deep , abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression with considerable speech therapy rehabilitation , global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia anomic aphasia , also known as anomia , is a non-fluent aphasia , which means the person speaks hesitantly because of a difficulty naming words and/or producing correct syntax in it , wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia

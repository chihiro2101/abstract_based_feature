first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits the view of expressive aphasia as an expressive disorder is supported by its frequent co-occurrence with facial motor difficulties , and its anatomical localization these deficits generally involve sentences that are grammatical , but atypical in their word order lesions exclusively to broca 's area ( the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus ) do not produce broca 's aphasia , but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia , sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus in the distribution of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery , known as '' wernicke 's area '' , an area adjacent to the cortex responsible for auditory processing these studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of broca 's area and the semantic functions of wernicke 's area are indeed deep , abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression another less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia , which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs , including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both broca 's area and wernicke 's area with considerable speech therapy rehabilitation , global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia anomic aphasia , also known as anomia , is a non-fluent aphasia , which means the person speaks hesitantly because of a difficulty naming words and/or producing correct syntax the discovery of what is now known as broca 's area was followed years later by carl wernicke 's famous work , 'the symptom-complex of aphasia : a psychological study on an anatomical basis ' in 1874

first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits nonetheless , because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved , and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across , the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions , it is most commonly associated with the inferior frontal gyrus , a region that overlaps with motor cortex controlling the mouth and tongue , extending into the periventricular white matter not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce broca 's aphasia , but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-rolandic motor strip ( the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control ) is also necessary receptive aphasia was originally described by the german neurologist karl wernicke , a contemporary of broca receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus in the distribution of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery , known as '' wernicke 's area '' , an area adjacent to the cortex responsible for auditory processing a fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language , who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to expressive and receptive aphasias in hearing populations conduction aphasia is a rare form of aphasia in which fibres in the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus are damaged however , supporting evidence for the theory that language had its own anatomical representation was not found until the case study of mr in it , wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia

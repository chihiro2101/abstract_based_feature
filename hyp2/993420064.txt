first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits nonetheless , because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved , and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across , the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences this evidence suggests that grammatical competence may be a specific function of broca 's area lesions exclusively to broca 's area ( the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus ) do not produce broca 's aphasia , but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia , sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce broca 's aphasia , but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-rolandic motor strip ( the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control ) is also necessary receptive aphasics produce speech that seems fluent and grammatical , but is largely devoid of sensible content therefore , the localization of the two best-known aphasias mirrors the grossest dichotomy in brain organization : anterior areas are specialized for motor output , and posterior areas for sensory processing a fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language , who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to expressive and receptive aphasias in hearing populations another less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia , which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs , including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both broca 's area and wernicke 's area other forms of aphasia often transition into a syndrome of primarily anomic aphasia in the process of recovery

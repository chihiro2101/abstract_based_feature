first described by the france neurologist paul broca in the nineteenth century , expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits nonetheless , because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved , and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across , the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions , it is most commonly associated with the inferior frontal gyrus , a region that overlaps with motor cortex controlling the mouth and tongue , extending into the periventricular white matter lesions exclusively to broca 's area ( the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus ) do not produce broca 's aphasia , but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia , sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce broca 's aphasia , but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-rolandic motor strip ( the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control ) is also necessary therefore , the localization of the two best-known aphasias mirrors the grossest dichotomy in brain organization : anterior areas are specialized for motor output , and posterior areas for sensory processing another less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia , which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs , including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both broca 's area and wernicke 's area with considerable speech therapy rehabilitation , global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia the discovery of what is now known as broca 's area was followed years later by carl wernicke 's famous work , 'the symptom-complex of aphasia : a psychological study on an anatomical basis ' in 1874 in it , wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia

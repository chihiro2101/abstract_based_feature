ghiorso 's ability to develop and produce these instruments , as well as a variety of electronic tasks , brought him into contact with the nuclear scientists at the university of california radiation laboratory at berkeley , in particular glenn seaborg ghiorso was raised in a devout christian family , but later left the religion and became an atheist in 1953 , in a collaboration with argonne lab , ghiorso and collaborators sought and found elements 99 ( einsteinium ) and 100 ( fermium ) , identified by their characteristic radiation in dust collected by airplanes from the first thermonuclear explosion ( the ivy mike ) in 1955 , the group used the cyclotron to produce 17 atoms of element 101 ( mendelevium ) , the first new element to be discovered atom-by-atom the recoil technique invented by ghiorso was crucial to obtaining an identifiable signal from individual atoms of the new element that machine was used in the discovery of elements 102-106 ( 102 , nobelium ; 103 , lawrencium ; 104 , rutherfordium ; 105 , dubnium and 106 , seaborgium ) , each produced and identified on the basis of only a few atoms with increasing atomic number , the experimental difficulties of producing and identifying a new element increase significantly in the 1970s and 1980s , resources for new element research at berkeley were diminishing , but the gsi laboratory at darmstadt , germany , under the leadership of peter armbruster and with considerable resources , was able to produce and identify elements 107-109 ( 107 , bohrium ; 108 , hassium and 109 , meitnerium ) in the early 1990s , the berkeley and darmstadt groups made a collaborative attempt to create element 110 his original name for element 105 ( hahnium ) was changed by the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) to dubnium , to recognize the contributions of the laboratory at dubna , russia , in the search for trans-fermium elements in 1999 , evidence for two superheavy elements ( livermorium and oganesson ) was published by a group in berkeley

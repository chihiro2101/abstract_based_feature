the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a client–server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server by design , there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as aim , wlm , whatsapp or telegram some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public xmpp server being run at jabber.org , to which many users subscribe however , anyone may run their own xmpp server on their own domain every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) the jid is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name ( or ip address rfc 6122 ) for the server where that user resides , separated by an at sign ( ) - for example , “ alice example.com “ : here alice is the username and example.com the server with which the user is registered jids without a username part are also valid , and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server the original and '' native '' transport protocol for xmpp is transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , using open-ended xml streams over long-lived tcp connections as an alternative to the tcp transport , the xmpp community has also developed an http transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls thus , in scenarios where the tcp port used by xmpp is blocked , a server can listen on the normal http port and the traffic should pass without problems the xmpp standards foundation or xsf ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions , so called xep building on its capability to support discovery across local network domains , xmpp is well-suited for cloud computing where virtual machines , networks , and firewalls would otherwise present obstacles to alternative service discovery and presence-based solutions along with authentication and in-transit data protection , xmpp can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or message-oriented middleware ( mom ) protocol at the moment , xmpp does not support quality of service ( qos ) ; assured delivery of messages has to be built on-top of the xmpp layer using the extension called jingle , xmpp can provide an open means to support machine to machine or peer-to-peer communications across a diverse set of networks one of the original design goals of the early jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems ( especially non-xmpp systems ) through a single client application this was done through entities called transports or gateways to other instant messaging protocols like icq , aim or yahoo messenger , but also to protocols such as sms , irc or email as a result , any client that fully supports xmpp can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client , and without the need for the client to have direct access to the internet one example is google , which in august 2005 introduced google talk , a combination voip and im system that uses xmpp for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called jingle xmpp is the de facto standard for private chat in gaming related platforms such as origin , and playstation , as well as the now discontinued xfire and raptr the early jabber protocol , as developed in 1999 and 2000 , formed the basis for xmpp as published in rfc 3920 and rfc 3921 in october 2004 ( the primary changes during formalization by the ietf 's xmpp working group were the addition of tls for channel encryption and sasl for authentication ) rfc 6121 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : instant messaging and presence describes instant messaging ( im ) , the most common application of xmpp rfc 7622 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : address format describes the rules for xmpp addresses , also called jabberids or jids

the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a clientâ€“server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server by design , there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as aim , wlm , whatsapp or telegram some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public xmpp server being run at jabber.org , to which many users subscribe however , anyone may run their own xmpp server on their own domain every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) for example , the full jid of a user 's mobile account could be username example.com/mobile as an alternative to the tcp transport , the xmpp community has also developed an http transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls in the original specification , xmpp could use http in two ways : polling and binding thus , in scenarios where the tcp port used by xmpp is blocked , a server can listen on the normal http port and the traffic should pass without problems the xmpp standards foundation or xsf ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions , so called xep this issue was being addressed by the experimental xep-0322 : efficient xml interchange ( exi ) format , where xml is serialized in a very efficient binary manner , especially in schema-informed mode using the extension called jingle , xmpp can provide an open means to support machine to machine or peer-to-peer communications across a diverse set of networks xmpp supports conferences with multiple users , using the specification multi-user chat ( muc ) ( xep-0045 ) while several service discovery protocols exist today ( such as zeroconf or the service location protocol ) , xmpp provides a solid base for the discovery of services residing locally or across a network , and the availability of these services ( via presence information ) , as specified by xep-0030 disco one of the original design goals of the early jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems ( especially non-xmpp systems ) through a single client application unlike instant messaging , xmpp provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an xmpp server any user can '' register '' with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network , and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were xmpp users several large public im services natively use or used xmpp , including livejournal 's '' lj talk '' , nimbuzz , and hipchat some of the largest messaging providers use , or have been using , various forms of xmpp based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users one example is google , which in august 2005 introduced google talk , a combination voip and im system that uses xmpp for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called jingle from 1999 until february 2006 , the service used jabberd as its server software , at which time it migrated to ejabberd ( both of which are free software application servers ) rfc 6121 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : instant messaging and presence describes instant messaging ( im ) , the most common application of xmpp xmpp has often been regarded as a competitor to simple , based on session initiation protocol ( sip ) , as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification

the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a client–server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server by design , there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as aim , wlm , whatsapp or telegram some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public xmpp server being run at jabber.org , to which many users subscribe however , anyone may run their own xmpp server on their own domain every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) the jid is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name ( or ip address rfc 6122 ) for the server where that user resides , separated by an at sign ( ) - for example , “ alice example.com “ : here alice is the username and example.com the server with which the user is registered messages simply sent to username example.com will go to the client with highest priority , but those sent to username example.com/mobile will go only to the mobile client the original and '' native '' transport protocol for xmpp is transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , using open-ended xml streams over long-lived tcp connections as an alternative to the tcp transport , the xmpp community has also developed an http transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls thus , in scenarios where the tcp port used by xmpp is blocked , a server can listen on the normal http port and the traffic should pass without problems furthermore , there are open public servers that listen on standard http ( port 80 ) and https ( port 443 ) ports , and hence allow connections from behind most firewalls the xmpp standards foundation or xsf ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions , so called xep xmpp applications beyond im include : chat rooms , network management , content syndication , collaboration tools , file sharing , gaming , remote systems control and monitoring , geolocation , middleware and cloud computing , voip , and identity services along with authentication and in-transit data protection , xmpp can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or message-oriented middleware ( mom ) protocol at the moment , xmpp does not support quality of service ( qos ) ; assured delivery of messages has to be built on-top of the xmpp layer the best example of this is the jingle xmpp extension protocol , xep-0166 numerous xmpp server software exist , some well known ones include ejabberd and prosody there are thousands of xmpp servers worldwide , many public ones as well as private individuals or organizations running their own servers without commercial intent various hosting services , such as dreamhost , enable hosting customers to choose xmpp services alongside more traditional web and email services some of the largest messaging providers use , or have been using , various forms of xmpp based protocols in their backend systems without necessarily exposing this fact to their end users from 1999 until february 2006 , the service used jabberd as its server software , at which time it migrated to ejabberd ( both of which are free software application servers ) rfc 6121 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : instant messaging and presence describes instant messaging ( im ) , the most common application of xmpp xmpp has often been regarded as a competitor to simple , based on session initiation protocol ( sip ) , as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification

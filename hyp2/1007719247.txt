the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a clientâ€“server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public xmpp server being run at jabber.org , to which many users subscribe every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) messages simply sent to username example.com will go to the client with highest priority , but those sent to username example.com/mobile will go only to the mobile client jids without a username part are also valid , and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server the original and '' native '' transport protocol for xmpp is transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , using open-ended xml streams over long-lived tcp connections as an alternative to the tcp transport , the xmpp community has also developed an http transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls because the client uses http , most firewalls allow clients to fetch and post messages without any hindrances thus , in scenarios where the tcp port used by xmpp is blocked , a server can listen on the normal http port and the traffic should pass without problems the xmpp standards foundation or xsf ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions , so called xep building on its capability to support discovery across local network domains , xmpp is well-suited for cloud computing where virtual machines , networks , and firewalls would otherwise present obstacles to alternative service discovery and presence-based solutions along with authentication and in-transit data protection , xmpp can be applied at a variety of levels and may prove ideal as an extensible middleware or message-oriented middleware ( mom ) protocol at the moment , xmpp does not support quality of service ( qos ) ; assured delivery of messages has to be built on-top of the xmpp layer xmpp supports conferences with multiple users , using the specification multi-user chat ( muc ) ( xep-0045 ) , on a company intranet ) , and secure authentication ( sasl ) and point-to-point encryption ( tls ) have been built into the core xmpp specifications , as well as off-the-record messaging ( otr ) is an extension of xmpp enabling encryption of messages and data unlike instant messaging , xmpp provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an xmpp server one example is google , which in august 2005 introduced google talk , a combination voip and im system that uses xmpp for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called jingle in january 2008 , aol introduced experimental xmpp support for its aim ( software ) ( aim ) service , allowing aim users to communicate using xmpp the xmpp working group also produced specifications rfc 3922 and rfc 3923 in addition to these core protocols standardized at the ietf , the xmpp standards foundation ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions xmpp features such as federation across domains , publish/subscribe , authentication and its security even for mobile endpoints are being used to implement the internet of things rfc 6121 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : instant messaging and presence describes instant messaging ( im ) , the most common application of xmpp rfc 7622 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : address format describes the rules for xmpp addresses , also called jabberids or jids

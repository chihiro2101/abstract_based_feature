the xmpp network architecture is reminiscent of the simple mail transfer protocol ( smtp ) , a client–server model ; clients do not talk directly to one another as it is decentralized - anyone can run a server by design , there is no central authoritative server as there is with messaging services such as aim , wlm , whatsapp or telegram some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public xmpp server being run at jabber.org , to which many users subscribe however , anyone may run their own xmpp server on their own domain every user on the network has a unique xmpp address , called jid ( for historical reasons , xmpp addresses are often called jabber ids ) the jid is structured like an email address with a username and a domain name ( or ip address rfc 6122 ) for the server where that user resides , separated by an at sign ( ) - for example , “ alice example.com “ : here alice is the username and example.com the server with which the user is registered jids without a username part are also valid , and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server the means to route messages based on a logical endpoint identifier - the jid , instead of by an explicit ip address present opportunities to use xmpp as an overlay network implementation on top of different underlay networks the original and '' native '' transport protocol for xmpp is transmission control protocol ( tcp ) , using open-ended xml streams over long-lived tcp connections as an alternative to the tcp transport , the xmpp community has also developed an http transport for web clients as well as users behind restricted firewalls the binding method , implemented using bidirectional-streams over synchronous http ( bosh ) , allows servers to push messages to clients as soon as they are sent the xmpp standards foundation or xsf ( formerly the jabber software foundation ) is active in developing open xmpp extensions , so called xep cloud computing and storage systems rely on various forms of communication over multiple levels , including not only messaging between systems to relay state but also the migration or distribution of larger objects , such as storage or virtual machines at the moment , xmpp does not support quality of service ( qos ) ; assured delivery of messages has to be built on-top of the xmpp layer , on a company intranet ) , and secure authentication ( sasl ) and point-to-point encryption ( tls ) have been built into the core xmpp specifications , as well as off-the-record messaging ( otr ) is an extension of xmpp enabling encryption of messages and data this gives a higher level of security , by encrypting all data from the source client and decrypting again at the target client ; the server operator can not decrypt the data they are forwarding one of the original design goals of the early jabber open-source community was enabling users to connect to multiple instant messaging systems ( especially non-xmpp systems ) through a single client application unlike instant messaging , xmpp provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running alongside an xmpp server a large number of xmpp client software exist on various modern and legacy platforms , including both graphical and command line based clients several large public im services natively use or used xmpp , including livejournal 's '' lj talk '' , nimbuzz , and hipchat one example is google , which in august 2005 introduced google talk , a combination voip and im system that uses xmpp for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol called jingle rfc 6121 , extensible messaging and presence protocol ( xmpp ) : instant messaging and presence describes instant messaging ( im ) , the most common application of xmpp the xmpp extensions for publish-subscribe provide many of the same features as the advanced message queuing protocol ( amqp ) .

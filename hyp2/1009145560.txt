the equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between barry commoner , paul r commoner argued that environmental impacts in the united states were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following world war ii and focused on present-day deteriorating environmental conditions in the united states ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time —— the equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment , but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by paul ehrlich , george wald , denis hayes , lester brown , rené dubos , and sidney ripley that did not come to pass the variable '' i '' in the '' i pat '' equation represents environmental impact the environment may be viewed as a self-regenerating system that can endure a certain level of impact as long as '' i '' is less than the carrying capacity the associated population , affluence , and technology that make up '' i '' can be perpetually endured if '' i '' exceeds the carrying capacity , then the system is said to be in overshoot , which may only be a temporary state population is expressed in human numbers ; therefore affluence is measured in units of gha per capita since the rise of industrial societies , human population has been increasing exponentially while gdp per capita measures production , it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases gdp per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the i pat equation for example , for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured , an appropriate unit for t might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp , the efficiency in carbon use ) since 1980 , world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth this means the equation does not account for varying degrees of power , influence , and responsibility of individuals over environmental impact i pat does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations , unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low-impact practices

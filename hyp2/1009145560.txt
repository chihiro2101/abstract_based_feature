commoner argued that environmental impacts in the united states were caused primarily by changes in its production technology following world war ii and focused on present-day deteriorating environmental conditions in the united states ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time —— the equation can aid in understanding some of the factors affecting human impacts on the environment , but it has also been cited as a basis for many of the dire environmental predictions of the 1970s by paul ehrlich , george wald , denis hayes , lester brown , rené dubos , and sidney ripley that did not come to pass r bailey ( 2000 ) earth day then and now , reason 32 ( 1 ) , 18-28 neal koblitz classified equations of this type as '' mathematical propaganda '' and criticized ehrlich 's use of them in the media ( e.g the variable '' i '' in the '' i pat '' equation represents environmental impact overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to endure impact , therefore reducing the carrying capacity impact may be measured using ecological footprint analysis in units of global hectares ( gha ) impact is modeled as the product of three terms , giving gha as a result in the i pat equation , the variable p represents the population of an area , such as the world this has caused thomas malthus , paul ehrlich and many others to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine ( see malthusian growth model ) the united nations project that world population will increase from 7.7 billion today ( 2019 ) to 9.8 billion in 2050 and about 11.2 billion in 2100 gdp per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the i pat equation the t variable in the i pat equation represents how resource intensive the production of affluence is ; how much environmental impact is involved in creating , transporting and disposing of the goods , services and amenities used since technology can affect environmental impact in many different ways , the unit for t is often tailored for the situation to which i pat is being applied i pat does not account for sustainable resource use among some poor and indigenous populations , unfairly characterizing these populations whose cultures support low-impact practices as a result of the interdependencies between p , a , and t and potential rebound effects , policies aimed at decreasing environmental impacts through reductions in p , a , and t may not only be very difficult to implement ( e.g

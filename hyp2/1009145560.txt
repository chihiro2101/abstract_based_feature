the equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between barry commoner , paul r ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time on the tonight show ) to sway the general public the variable '' i '' in the '' i pat '' equation represents environmental impact as long as '' i '' is less than the carrying capacity the associated population , affluence , and technology that make up '' i '' can be perpetually endured impact may be measured using ecological footprint analysis in units of global hectares ( gha ) impact is modeled as the product of three terms , giving gha as a result population is expressed in human numbers ; therefore affluence is measured in units of gha per capita in the i pat equation , the variable p represents the population of an area , such as the world environmental impacts of population gdp per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the i pat equation increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact for example , the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts : 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires ; 682 & nbsp ; lbs for example , for a situation where the human impact on climate change is being measured , an appropriate unit for t might be greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gdp in reality , at least seven interdependencies between p , a , and t could exist , indicating that it is more correct to rewrite the equation as i f ( p , a , t ) environmental impact is a function of human numbers , affluence ( i.e

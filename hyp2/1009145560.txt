the equation was developed in 1970 during the course of a debate between barry commoner , paul r ehrlich and holdren argued that all three factors were important but emphasized the role of human population growth , focusing on a broader scale , being less specific in space and time the variable '' i '' in the '' i pat '' equation represents environmental impact as long as '' i '' is less than the carrying capacity the associated population , affluence , and technology that make up '' i '' can be perpetually endured overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to endure impact , therefore reducing the carrying capacity population is expressed in human numbers ; therefore affluence is measured in units of gha per capita this has caused thomas malthus , paul ehrlich and many others to postulate that this growth would continue until checked by widespread hunger and famine ( see malthusian growth model ) these projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children environmental impacts of population as the consumption of each person increases , the total environmental impact increases as well while gdp per capita measures production , it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases gdp per capita has been rising steadily over the last few centuries and is driving up human impact in the i pat equation increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact , the efficiency in carbon use ) since 1980 , world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth there have also been comments that this model depicts people as being purely detrimental to the environment , ignoring any conservation or restoration efforts that societies have made environmental impact is a function of human numbers , affluence ( i.e

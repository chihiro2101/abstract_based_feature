r bailey ( 2000 ) earth day then and now , reason 32 ( 1 ) , 18-28 neal koblitz classified equations of this type as '' mathematical propaganda '' and criticized ehrlich 's use of them in the media ( e.g the variable '' i '' in the '' i pat '' equation represents environmental impact overshoot may degrade the ability of the environment to endure impact , therefore reducing the carrying capacity impact may be measured using ecological footprint analysis in units of global hectares ( gha ) ecological footprint per capita is a measure of the quantity of earth 's biologically productive surface that is needed to regenerate the resources consumed per capita impact is modeled as the product of three terms , giving gha as a result population is expressed in human numbers ; therefore affluence is measured in units of gha per capita these projections take into consideration that population growth has slowed in recent years as women are having fewer children although the un projects that human population may stabilize at around 11.2 billion in 2100 , the i pat equation will continue to be relevant for the increasing human impact on the environment in the short to mid-term future while gdp per capita measures production , it is often assumed that consumption increases when production increases increased consumption significantly increases human environmental impact for example , the construction of a car has the following environmental impacts : 605,664 gallons of water for parts and tires ; 682 & nbsp ; lbs ecological impacts of each product are far-reaching ; increases in consumption quickly result in large impacts on the environment through direct and indirect sources , the efficiency in carbon use ) since 1980 , world fossil energy consumption has increased in line with economic and population growth however , it has been argued that the latter criticism not only assumes low impacts for indigenous populations , but also misunderstands the i pat equation itself it is assumed that small-scale societies have low environmental impacts due to their practices and orientations alone but there is little evidence to support this

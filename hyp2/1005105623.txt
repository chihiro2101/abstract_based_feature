the first well-documented crossing of the north atlantic , though not the earliest , was that of john cabot 's ship matthew in the summer of 1497 over the next three centuries countless vessels ( merchant ships and warships , fast and slow , in peace and war ) crossed back and forth over the north atlantic , all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 the idea of building a line of transatlantic steamships was mooted in 1832 by junius smith , american lawyer turned london merchant the idea came to him during an atlantic crossing which took 57 days , a not unusual occurrence , smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service the next year , the great western steamship company was established , even though the rail line was still years from completion when great western scheduled its initial sailing , laird suggested that british and american charter the irish sea steamer from the st with her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots ( 14.87 km/h ) , sirius is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations great western herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at as late as 1843 the cunard line started its liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of great western with about the same speed in its first year , 1850 , the set the record at on a 10-day run from liverpool to new york the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at during the crimean war , cunard supplied eleven of its ships for war service and suspended all routes except the liverpool-halifax-boston service while the collins ' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war , collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers the following year , white star 's adriatic finally surpassed scotia with a voyage at while she only won the eastbound record , two years later , guion took delivery of the even faster alaska that set the record at the new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers , the twin screw and the starting in 1889 , the later ship set the record on four occasions , including a voyage at in 1892 in 1902 , white star joined the well capitalised american combine , the international mercantile marine co starting in 1907 , both ships won the blue riband and mauretania â€™ s 1909 record of stood for 20 years however , these ships paid a price for speed and lacked many of the amenities found in the new white star and hamburg american luxury liners there is a persistent rumor that was attempting to win the blue riband and that such effort resulted in excessive speed and collision with the iceberg such a rumor is undoubtedly false , as the titanic was built for luxury not speed using these funds , ndl ordered two ships designed to cross the atlantic in five days , the and bremen recorded on her 1929 blue riband voyage and europa increased the blue riband to in 1933 oceanic 's ahead-of-their-time engines would have been powerful enough to enable her to possibly win the blue riband queen mary was commissioned the next year , and after a few break-in voyages , took the blue riband to she also made a record-breaking return journey , winning the columbus atlantic trophy , posted by the yacht club in response to the virgin atlantic challenge for the fastest two-way voyage i.e the ocean rowing society inspired by the blue riband concept created blue riband trophy of ocean rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the atlantic ocean in an unsupported row boat because there was no sanctioning body for the blue riband , researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of blue riband winners for example , gibbs credits inman 's city of paris with an 1866 blue riband voyage , and cunard 's russia with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious scotia 's blue riband claim of , supposedly based on a very long track

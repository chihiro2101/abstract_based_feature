the first well-documented crossing of the north atlantic , though not the earliest , was that of john cabot 's ship matthew in the summer of 1497 over the next three centuries countless vessels ( merchant ships and warships , fast and slow , in peace and war ) crossed back and forth over the north atlantic , all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service the next year , the great western steamship company was established , even though the rail line was still years from completion by spring 1838 , brunel 's was ready for sea , but smith 's first ship was still without engines great western herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at as late as 1843 the cunard line started its liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of great western with about the same speed by 1846 , cunard was the only original steamship line that survived , largely because of its subsidy from the british admiralty to carry the mails and its emphasis on safety the american government supplied collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to cunard 's best in its first year , 1850 , the set the record at on a 10-day run from liverpool to new york while the collins ' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war , collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the scotia , the last paddle steamer to set a record with a queenstown-new york voyage at in 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the white star line commissioned oceanic and her five sisters the new white star record breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines , but their high ratio of length to beam ( 10:1 compared to the previous norm of 8:1 ) increased vibration inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard , but cunard lagged behind both of its rivals when cunard rejected his proposal , pearce offered his idea to the guion line , a firm primarily engaged in the steerage trade the first ship pearce built for guion , the arizona was described as a '' souped up transatlantic hot rod '' by one nautical historian while she only won the eastbound record , two years later , guion took delivery of the even faster alaska that set the record at later that year , cunard commissioned the first steel-hulled record-breakers , umbria and etruria inman directors agreed to voluntary liquidation so that the largest creditor , the philadelphia-based international navigation company could purchase inman 's assets the new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers , the twin screw and the white star , which had not built an express liner since the of 1875 , commissioned the record-breaker , of 1889 and of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the admiralty to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities inman became the american line and ordered two additional express liners from american yards , but no attempt was made to best the new cunarders no sooner had cunard reestablished its supremacy than new rivals emerged its rival , norddeutscher lloyd ( ndl ) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record rather than match the new german speedsters , white star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed the next year , cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly southampton-new york service the two liners were operated as a pair and traded the blue riband again , with the cunard white star liner ultimately posting in 1938 the rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the blue riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction the ocean rowing society inspired by the blue riband concept created blue riband trophy of ocean rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the atlantic ocean in an unsupported row boat gibbs also includes the claimed blue riband voyage at of the national line 's america of 1884 that was not confirmed by later researchers

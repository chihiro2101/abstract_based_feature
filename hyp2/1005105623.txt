the first well-documented crossing of the north atlantic , though not the earliest , was that of john cabot 's ship matthew in the summer of 1497 over the next three centuries countless vessels ( merchant ships and warships , fast and slow , in peace and war ) crossed back and forth over the north atlantic , all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service the next year , the great western steamship company was established , even though the rail line was still years from completion when great western scheduled its initial sailing , laird suggested that british and american charter the irish sea steamer from the st george steam packet company for two voyages to beat great western with her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots ( 14.87 km/h ) , sirius is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations the cunard line started its liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of great western with about the same speed by 1846 , cunard was the only original steamship line that survived , largely because of its subsidy from the british admiralty to carry the mails and its emphasis on safety until 1850 , the record passed between various cunarders , finally reaching for an 8-day liverpool-halifax crossing by asia record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale cunard 's first serious competition for the record came from the american-owned collins line the american government supplied collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to cunard 's best the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at during the crimean war , cunard supplied eleven of its ships for war service and suspended all routes except the liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1845 , brunel 's became the first iron-hulled screw liner on the atlantic in 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the white star line commissioned oceanic and her five sisters inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard , but cunard lagged behind both of its rivals the first ship pearce built for guion , the arizona was described as a '' souped up transatlantic hot rod '' by one nautical historian while she only won the eastbound record , two years later , guion took delivery of the even faster alaska that set the record at inman became the american line and ordered two additional express liners from american yards , but no attempt was made to best the new cunarders its rival , norddeutscher lloyd ( ndl ) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record bremen recorded on her 1929 blue riband voyage and europa increased the blue riband to in 1933 consequently , cgt altered its plans to make its new liner even bigger the two liners were operated as a pair and traded the blue riband again , with the cunard white star liner ultimately posting in 1938 however , the united states government was impressed by the large numbers of troops carried by the queens during the war , and ordered a superliner that was as much a troop carrier as an express liner despite having to stop to refuel on several occasions , branson shaved two hours off the record , increasing the average speed to 36.4 knots this was achieved in 1990 by hoverspeed great britain , with a non-stop crossing of 79 hours 54 minutes , averaging 36.6 knots and incat were awarded the trophy by the hales trophy committee with the end of the express liners era , the blue riband has become an item of largely historical interest , with some authors regarding the united states as the last holder of the accolade therefore , most lists feature sirius , in her race with great western in 1838 , as the first record-holder , although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period gibbs also includes the claimed blue riband voyage at of the national line 's america of 1884 that was not confirmed by later researchers

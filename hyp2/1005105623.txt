the first well-documented crossing of the north atlantic , though not the earliest , was that of john cabot 's ship matthew in the summer of 1497 it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 the idea came to him during an atlantic crossing which took 57 days , a not unusual occurrence , after receiving no support for several years , his plan gained credibility when scottish shipbuilder , macgregor laird became an investor smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service the next year , the great western steamship company was established , even though the rail line was still years from completion while the sirius left cork , ireland four days before great western departed avonmouth , great western still came within a day of overtaking sirius to new york to complete the voyage , sirius was forced to burn spars when coal ran low with her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots ( 14.87 km/h ) , sirius is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations great western herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at as late as 1843 the cunard line started its liverpool-halifax-boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of great western with about the same speed record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale cunard 's first serious competition for the record came from the american-owned collins line the american government supplied collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to cunard 's best the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at while the collins ' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war , collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the scotia , the last paddle steamer to set a record with a queenstown-new york voyage at scotia was the final significant paddler ordered for the atlantic because under the terms of cunard 's mail contract with the admiralty , it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service in 1845 , brunel 's became the first iron-hulled screw liner on the atlantic starting in 1850 , the inman line built numerous reduced versions for the steerage trade in 1866 , inman started to commission single screw express liners that were the equal of scotia the admiralty allowed cunard to order its first screw express liner , the russia the following year , white star 's adriatic finally surpassed scotia with a voyage at the new white star record breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines , but their high ratio of length to beam ( 10:1 compared to the previous norm of 8:1 ) increased vibration inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard , but cunard lagged behind both of its rivals he proposed a ship that crammed the most powerful machinery possible into the hull , sacrificing everything to speed when cunard rejected his proposal , pearce offered his idea to the guion line , a firm primarily engaged in the steerage trade in 1889 , the hamburg america line commissioned four double screw steamers capable of bremen recorded on her 1929 blue riband voyage and europa increased the blue riband to in 1933 the two liners were operated as a pair and traded the blue riband again , with the cunard white star liner ultimately posting in 1938 at sea united states record stood until 1986 , when it was challenged by british entrepreneur richard branson , and his high-speed motor vessel , virgin atlantic challenger gibbs also includes the claimed blue riband voyage at of the national line 's america of 1884 that was not confirmed by later researchers

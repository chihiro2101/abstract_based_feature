the first well-documented crossing of the north atlantic , though not the earliest , was that of john cabot 's ship matthew in the summer of 1497 it was the advent of the steam ship , with its independence from wind power , which offered the possibility of regular , scheduled atlantic crossings , in periods of two to three weeks , that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 . cunard refused officially to recognise the title because racing vessels was not in line with the company 's safety policy after receiving no support for several years , his plan gained credibility when scottish shipbuilder , macgregor laird became an investor smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service when great western scheduled its initial sailing , laird suggested that british and american charter the irish sea steamer from the st george steam packet company for two voyages to beat great western with her westbound crossing at 8.03 knots ( 14.87 km/h ) , sirius is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations by 1846 , cunard was the only original steamship line that survived , largely because of its subsidy from the british admiralty to carry the mails and its emphasis on safety cunard 's first serious competition for the record came from the american-owned collins line in its first year , 1850 , the set the record at on a 10-day run from liverpool to new york the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at while the collins ' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war , collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers in 1866 , inman started to commission single screw express liners that were the equal of scotia the first ship pearce built for guion , the arizona was described as a '' souped up transatlantic hot rod '' by one nautical historian etruria , the faster of the pair , raised the record to on a 6-day , 2-hour run from queenstown to sandy hook in 1888 the new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers , the twin screw and the cunard countered with two even faster ships , the campania and the lucania of 1893 beginning in the late 1860s , several german firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the british mail steamers working from liverpool in 1898 , the raised the record to , while the other liner , kaiser friedrich failed to achieve her contract speed and was returned to her builders rather than match the new german speedsters , white star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed white star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra day at sea in 1902 , white star joined the well capitalised american combine , the international mercantile marine co starting in 1907 , both ships won the blue riband and mauretania â€™ s 1909 record of stood for 20 years bremen recorded on her 1929 blue riband voyage and europa increased the blue riband to in 1933 consequently , cgt altered its plans to make its new liner even bigger queen mary was commissioned the next year , and after a few break-in voyages , took the blue riband to the rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the blue riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction with the success of united states in 1952 and cunard 's decision not to challenge the new record the blue riband contest again subsided the ocean rowing society inspired by the blue riband concept created blue riband trophy of ocean rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the atlantic ocean in an unsupported row boat with the end of the express liners era , the blue riband has become an item of largely historical interest , with some authors regarding the united states as the last holder of the accolade because there was no sanctioning body for the blue riband , researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of blue riband winners

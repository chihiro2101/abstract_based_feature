the first well-documented crossing of the north atlantic , though not the earliest , was that of john cabot 's ship matthew in the summer of 1497 the term '' blue riband of the atlantic '' did not come into use until the 1890s , and the history of the trans-atlantic competition , which was compiled retrospectively , was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships sirius and great western in 1838 smith , who is often considered the father of the atlantic liner , formed the british and american steam navigation company to operate a london-new york service while the sirius left cork , ireland four days before great western departed avonmouth , great western still came within a day of overtaking sirius to new york great western herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at as late as 1843 by 1846 , cunard was the only original steamship line that survived , largely because of its subsidy from the british admiralty to carry the mails and its emphasis on safety until 1850 , the record passed between various cunarders , finally reaching for an 8-day liverpool-halifax crossing by asia record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale cunard 's first serious competition for the record came from the american-owned collins line the american government supplied collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to cunard 's best in its first year , 1850 , the set the record at on a 10-day run from liverpool to new york the next year , cunard put further pressure on collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler , the persia , which set a new record with a 9-day , 16-hour liverpool-new york voyage at while the collins ' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war , collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the scotia , the last paddle steamer to set a record with a queenstown-new york voyage at scotia was the final significant paddler ordered for the atlantic because under the terms of cunard 's mail contract with the admiralty , it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service starting in 1850 , the inman line built numerous reduced versions for the steerage trade the admiralty allowed cunard to order its first screw express liner , the russia to counter this , white star placed the dining saloon midships and made their ships more luxurious he proposed a ship that crammed the most powerful machinery possible into the hull , sacrificing everything to speed the first ship pearce built for guion , the arizona was described as a '' souped up transatlantic hot rod '' by one nautical historian while she only won the eastbound record , two years later , guion took delivery of the even faster alaska that set the record at after being out of the contest for a decade , cunard finally started to rebuild later that year , cunard commissioned the first steel-hulled record-breakers , umbria and etruria the inman line fell on hard times after their intended record-breaker , city of rome failed to meet expectations and was returned to her builders in 1882 starting in 1889 , the later ship set the record on four occasions , including a voyage at in 1892 inman became the american line and ordered two additional express liners from american yards , but no attempt was made to best the new cunarders in 1889 , the hamburg america line commissioned four double screw steamers capable of its rival , norddeutscher lloyd ( ndl ) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record using these funds , ndl ordered two ships designed to cross the atlantic in five days , the and however , the american government netted the award against debts owed by the german government and berlin was forced to directly subsidise ndl to continue the project the rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the blue riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction the ocean rowing society inspired by the blue riband concept created blue riband trophy of ocean rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the atlantic ocean in an unsupported row boat gibbs also includes the claimed blue riband voyage at of the national line 's america of 1884 that was not confirmed by later researchers

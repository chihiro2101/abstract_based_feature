aldus manutius was born close to rome in bassiano between 1449 and 1452 giovanni pico and alberto pio 's families funded the starting costs of manutius 's printing press and gave him lands in carpi in venice , manutius began gathering publishing contracts , at which point he met andrea torresani , who was also engaged in print publishing torresani and manutius became lifelong business partners , and for their first contract together manutius hired torresani to print the first edition of his latin grammar book the institutiones grammaticae , published on 9 march 1493 the press 's first great achievement was a five-volume folio edition of aristotle manutius started the first volume of his aristotle edition in 1495 the aldine press produced nine comedies of aristophanes in 1498 , and pietro bembo edited petrarch poems that manutius published in july 1501 in addition to editing greek manuscripts , manutius corrected and improved texts originally published in florence , rome , and milan during that time , desiderius erasmus asked manutius to publish his translations of hecuba and iphigenia in aulis through the aldine press erasmus 's original letter to manutius inquires about the printer 's proposed plans : a greek plato and a polyglot bible in december 1507 , the aldine press published iphigenia in aulis in an 80-page octavo with erasmus 's translation from greek into latin after the publication of adagiorum chiliades , erasmus helped manutius proofread a greek edition of plutarch 's moralia along with many other aldine press publications he published an edition of minor greek orators ( 1508 ) and the lesser works of plutarch ( 1509 ) manutius put up a sign that read , '' whoever you are , aldus asks you again and again what it is you want from him this was carried out under continual difficulties , including problems arising from strikes among his workmen , unauthorized use of manutius 's materials by rivals , and frequent interruptions by war only four italian towns were authorized to produce greek publications : milan , venice , vicenza , and florence , and they only published works by theocritus , isocrates , and homer to preserve ancient greek literature , the aldine press commissioned a typeface based on classical greek manuscripts so that readers could experience the original greek text more authentically while publishing greek manuscripts , manutius founded the new academy , a group of hellenist scholars , in 1502 to promote greek studies '' members of the new academy included desiderius erasmus , pietro bembo , and scipio fortiguerra manutius spoke greek in his household , and employed thirty greek speakers at the aldine press greek speakers from crete prepared and proofed manuscripts and their calligraphy was a model for the casts used for greek type instructions for typesetters and binders were written in greek , and the prefaces to manutius 's editions were also in greek manutius printed editions of hero and leander by musaeus grammaticus , the galeomyomachia , and the greek psalter he called these '' precursors of the greek library '' because they served as guides to the greek language manutius launched pietro bembo 's career as a writer by publishing de aetna in 1496 , which was the aldine press 's first latin publication by a contemporary author the bembo family hired the aldine press to produce accurate texts of dante and petrarch using bernardo bembo 's personal manuscript collection bembo later made a diagram of sins to illustrate the 1515 aldine edition of dante manutius did not hold the same power of innovation over latin classics as with greek classics because publication of these works started 30 years before his time manutius was on the lookout for rare manuscripts , but often found instead missing parts of previously published works '' francesco negri let manutius publish the missing text of julius firmicus , which negri found in romania , and '' a manuscript from britain made an improved edition of prudentius possible '' the press printed first editions of poliziano collected works , pietro bembo asolani , francesco colonna 's hypnerotomachia poliphili , and dante 's divine comedy manutius 's editions of the classics were so highly respected that the dolphin-and-anchor device was almost immediately pirated by french and italian publishers many modern organizations use the image of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor the aldine press removed these inconveniences ; manutius 's books were '' published without commentary and in smaller sizes , usually octavos of five by eight or four by six inches other scholars believe the first greek typeface was derived from the handwriting of immanuel rhusotas , another scribe during the time of manutius the aldine press commissioned the first greek script designed '' with accents and letters cast separately and combined by the compositor a partial list of works translated and published by the aldine press under manutius 's supervision partial list of latin editions published during his lifetime : astronomica , julius firmicus , october 1499

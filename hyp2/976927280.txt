until 1987 , new zealand had a centrally run system of providers of generation , transmission , distribution , and retailing currently the market is split into the following areas : regulation , administration , generation , market clearing , transmission , distribution , metering and retail the wholesale market for electricity operates under the electricity industry participation code ( eipc ) , and is overseen by the market regulator , the electricity authority generators can make offers to supply electricity at grid injection points , while retailers and some major industrial users make bids to withdraw '' offtake '' electricity at grid exit points the market uses a locational marginal pricing auction which takes generators ' offers and retailers ' bids , and computes final prices and quantities at each node these markets are linked to wholesale market prices at select locations , allowing market participants to manage their basis risk the electricity authority contracts out the services required to run the electricity market transpower is also the system operator , responsible for ensuring real time electricity supply security and quality transpower is the market scheduler , predicting demand to help generators make offers , as well as the dispatcher , in charge of matching demand and supply in real time distribution of electricity from the grid exit points to the end consumers ' premises is the responsibility of about 30 distributors , also known as lines companies , who have monopoly control of the lines services on their networks there are five major generators : contact energy , genesis energy , mercury energy , meridian energy and trustpower meridian energy , genesis energy and mercury energy are 51 % majority owned by the new zealand government , contact and trustpower are 100 % publicly traded companies an important feature of the new zealand market is that all the major generators also own retailing arms the physical operation of the market is managed by transpower in its role as system operator electricity spot prices can vary significantly across trading periods , reflecting factors such as changing demand ( e.g generators make offers to supply electricity at 59 grid injection points ( gips ) at power stations , while retailers and major users make bids to buy electricity at 226 grid exit points ( gxps ) on the national grid final prices at each node , taking account of grid losses and constraints , are processed and confirmed the following day all electricity generated is required to be traded through the central pool , with the exception of small generating stations of less than 10mw trading develops by bids ( purchaser/demand ) and offers ( generator/supply ) for 48 half-hour periods for each pricing nodes on the national grid during each half-hour period transpower publishes a new real-time price every five minutes , and a time-weighted 30-minute average price rex ahdar , university of otago , later opined that competition law in new zealand is inherently ill-suited to tackling a network industry such as electricity in terms of residential electricity prices , a 2015 report found these were twice as high as would be expected under competition in its submission , the electricity authority stated that '' the high interim prices on 26 march 2011 , if they are allowed to become final prices threaten to damage the integrity and reputation of the wholesale market for electricity '' the government has increased the extent of intervention through the electricity industry reform act 1998 , which forced power companies to divest either their energy or their lines business the final set of electricity governance regulations and rules ( excluding rules for transmission ) became effective on 1 march 2004 a ministerial review of electricity market performance was initiated on 1 april 2009 and led by an independent electricity technical advisory group , appointed by the minister for energy and resources , with assistance from officials from the ministry of economic development prior to 1987 , the new zealand electricity department ( nzed ) , a government department , controlled and operated almost all electricity generation and operated the electric power transmission generation is dominated by five companies : contact energy , genesis energy , mercury energy , meridian energy , and trustpower there are a number of smaller companies in the electricity generation industry including wel networks , nz windfarms , nz energy , mainpower , pioneer and top energy the generation and retail companies use this vertical integration as a natural hedge to manage risks associated with volatility of the spot market energy section of the ministry of business , innovation & employment site has a wealth of detail and statistics on the electricity industry , and other new zealand energy matters

the christian identity movement emerged in the united states in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of british israelism however , adolf hitler did not subscribe to the belief that the israelites of the bible were aryans ; in a speech which he delivered in munich in 1920 and titled '' why we are anti-semites , '' he referred to and disparaged abraham as being racially jewish while early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo-semites , christian identity emerged in sharp contrast to british israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology the anti-defamation league ( adl ) describes the emergence of christian identity from british israelism as an 'ugly turn ' : another source describes the emergence of christian identity from british israelism as a '' remarkable transition , '' because traditional british israelites were advocates of philo-semitism which paradoxically changed to antisemitism and racism under christian identity in fact , british israelism had several jewish adherents , and it also received support from rabbis throughout the 19th century however , christian identity , which emerged in the 1920s , began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the jews are the descendants of satan or edomite-khazars ( see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry ) rather than the descendants of the tribe of judah ( as british israelites maintain ) rather , its adherents believed that modern-day jews were only descended from the tribes of judah and benjamin , while the british and other related northern european peoples were descended from the other ten tribes an early book which advanced the ideas of british israelism was lost israel found in the anglo-saxon race by e.p around 1924 , rand began to claim that the jews are descended from esau or the canaanites rather than the tribe of judah he never went so far as to advocate the '' serpent seed '' doctrine that modern-day jews are descendants of satan ; he only claimed that they are not the lineal descendants of judah rand is considered a 'transitional ' figure from british israelism to christian identity , rather than its actual founder rand is known as the first person to coin the term 'christian identity ' in 1933 rand set up the anglo-saxon federation of america which promoted his view that the jews are not descended from judah , marking the first key transition from british israelism to christian identity william dudley pelley , the founder of the clerical fascism silver shirts movement , was influenced by british israelism in the early 1930s links between christian identity and the ku klux klan were also forged in the late 1930s , although the kkk was by then past the peak of its early twentieth-century revival christian identity began to emerge out of british israelism in the 1940s , primarily over issues of racism and anti-semitism rather than theology swift was born in new jersey , and eventually moved to los angeles in order to attend bible college gale became a leading figure in the anti-tax and paramilitary movements of the 1970s and 1980s , beginning with the california rangers and the posse comitatus , and he also helped found the american militia movement future aryan nations founder richard girnt butler , who was an admirer of both adolf hitler and wisconsin senator joseph mccarthy , was introduced to wesley swift by william potter gale in 1962 butler eventually gained control and moved the organization from california to hayden lake , idaho in 1973 tax evasion and militia movement organizer gordon kahl , whose death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities helped inspire the order , also had connections to the christian identity movement due to the promotion of christian identity doctrines through radio and later through the internet , an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold christian identity beliefs christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered europeans to be the chosen people and jews to be the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' ( or serpent seed ) ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) wesley swift formulated the doctrine that non-caucasian peoples have no souls and therefore can never earn god 's favor or be saved no single document expresses the christian identity belief system ; there is much disagreement over the doctrines which are taught by those who ascribe to ci beliefs , since there is no central organization or headquarters for the ci sect christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe or caucasians in general are god 's servant people , according to the promises that were given to abraham , isaac , and jacob while they seek to introduce a state of racial purity in the us , christian identitarians do not trust the congress or the government , allegedly controlled by jews , to support their agenda like british israelites , christian identity ( ci ) adherents believe in two house theology , which makes a distinction between the tribe of judah and the ten lost tribes identity teaches that '' israel '' was the name given to jacob after he wrestled with the angel at penuel as described in genesis 32:26â€“32 identity adherents reject the label '' antisemitic '' by stating that they can not be antisemitic because the true semites '' today are the great white christian nations of the western world , '' with modern jews being considered the descendants of the canaanites the first documents which advocated christian identity 's views on racial politics and economics were written by howard rand and william j '' while rand never formally admitted to what groups he was specifically referring , his hatred for jews , racial integration , and the country 's economic state at that time made the direction of his comments obvious god and race : british-israelism and christian identity , p christian identity : the aryan american bloodline religion race over grace : the racialist religion of the christian identity movement , omaha , nebraska : iuniverse press

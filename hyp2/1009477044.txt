the christian identity movement emerged in the united states in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of british israelism however , adolf hitler did not subscribe to the belief that the israelites of the bible were aryans ; in a speech which he delivered in munich in 1920 and titled '' why we are anti-semites , '' he referred to and disparaged abraham as being racially jewish while early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo-semites , christian identity emerged in sharp contrast to british israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology the anti-defamation league ( adl ) describes the emergence of christian identity from british israelism as an 'ugly turn ' : another source describes the emergence of christian identity from british israelism as a '' remarkable transition , '' because traditional british israelites were advocates of philo-semitism which paradoxically changed to antisemitism and racism under christian identity however , christian identity , which emerged in the 1920s , began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the jews are the descendants of satan or edomite-khazars ( see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry ) rather than the descendants of the tribe of judah ( as british israelites maintain ) rather , its adherents believed that modern-day jews were only descended from the tribes of judah and benjamin , while the british and other related northern european peoples were descended from the other ten tribes an early book which advanced the ideas of british israelism was lost israel found in the anglo-saxon race by e.p he never went so far as to advocate the '' serpent seed '' doctrine that modern-day jews are descendants of satan ; he only claimed that they are not the lineal descendants of judah rand is considered a 'transitional ' figure from british israelism to christian identity , rather than its actual founder in 1933 rand set up the anglo-saxon federation of america which promoted his view that the jews are not descended from judah , marking the first key transition from british israelism to christian identity william dudley pelley , the founder of the clerical fascism silver shirts movement , was influenced by british israelism in the early 1930s links between christian identity and the ku klux klan were also forged in the late 1930s , although the kkk was by then past the peak of its early twentieth-century revival christian identity began to emerge out of british israelism in the 1940s , primarily over issues of racism and anti-semitism rather than theology due to swift 's efforts , the message of his church spread , leading to the creation of similar churches throughout the country gale became a leading figure in the anti-tax and paramilitary movements of the 1970s and 1980s , beginning with the california rangers and the posse comitatus , and he also helped found the american militia movement swift quickly converted butler to christian identity tax evasion and militia movement organizer gordon kahl , whose death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities helped inspire the order , also had connections to the christian identity movement the movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993 , in the wake of the deadly ruby ridge confrontation , when newspapers discovered that former green beret and right-wing separatist randy weaver had at least a loose association with christian identity believers rather than being an organized religion , christian identity ( '' ci '' ) is adhered to by individuals , local church and some prison gangs some christian identity churches preach more violent rhetoric than others , but all of them believe that aryans are god 's chosen race christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered europeans to be the chosen people and jews to be the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' ( or serpent seed ) ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) ci adherents cite passages from the old testament , including , , and , which they claim contain yahweh 's injunctions against interracial marriages christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe or caucasians in general are god 's servant people , according to the promises that were given to abraham , isaac , and jacob it further asserts that the early european tribes were really the ten lost tribes of israel and therefore the rightful heirs to god 's promises , and god 's chosen people '' according to michael mcfarland and glenn gottfried , they drew their racist beliefs on christianity because of its status as a traditional religion of the united states , which allowed for a common identification , and because of the variety of possible interpretations of the bible in the field of hermeneutics like british israelites , christian identity ( ci ) adherents believe in two house theology , which makes a distinction between the tribe of judah and the ten lost tribes in short , christian identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day jews , the true descendants of the houses of israel and judah are the modern-day anglo-saxon , celtic , germanic , nordic , and kindred peoples after they were subsequently conquered by assyria at approximately 721 bc , the ten tribes disappeared from the biblical record and became known as the lost tribes of israel thus anglo-saxons are the true israelites , god 's chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the second coming of christ identity adherents reject the label '' antisemitic '' by stating that they can not be antisemitic because the true semites '' today are the great white christian nations of the western world , '' with modern jews being considered the descendants of the canaanites the kabbalists call the serpent the nahash ( which means the serpent in hebrew ) scientific racism , sometimes termed biological racism or racialism , the pseudoscience that empirical evidence exists to support or justify racism , is the core tenet of christian identity , and most ci adherents are white nationalists who advocate racial segregation it is also commonplace for some christian identity adherents to adhere to the teachings of the king james only and sacred name movements and as a result , they insist on using the original hebrew names whenever they refer to god ( yahweh ) and jesus christ ( yeshua ) unlike many protestant fundamentalists , christian identity adherents reject the notion of a rapture , based on their belief that it is a judaized doctrine which the bible does not teach god and race : british-israelism and christian identity , p

the christian identity movement emerged in the united states in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of british israelism however , adolf hitler did not subscribe to the belief that the israelites of the bible were aryans ; in a speech which he delivered in munich in 1920 and titled '' why we are anti-semites , '' he referred to and disparaged abraham as being racially jewish while early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo-semites , christian identity emerged in sharp contrast to british israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology however , christian identity , which emerged in the 1920s , began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the jews are the descendants of satan or edomite-khazars ( see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry ) rather than the descendants of the tribe of judah ( as british israelites maintain ) the typical form of the british israelite belief held no antisemitic views he never went so far as to advocate the '' serpent seed '' doctrine that modern-day jews are descendants of satan ; he only claimed that they are not the lineal descendants of judah rand is considered a 'transitional ' figure from british israelism to christian identity , rather than its actual founder in 1933 rand set up the anglo-saxon federation of america which promoted his view that the jews are not descended from judah , marking the first key transition from british israelism to christian identity these meetings provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of christian identity links between christian identity and the ku klux klan were also forged in the late 1930s , although the kkk was by then past the peak of its early twentieth-century revival wesley swift ( 1913–1970 ) is considered to be the father of the movement ; so much so that every anti-defamation league publication addressing christian identity mentions him '' in 1946 , he founded his own church in lancaster , california and named it the anglo-saxon christian congregation , reflecting the influence of howard rand eventually , the name of his church was changed to the church of jesus christ–christian , which is used today by aryan nations gale became a leading figure in the anti-tax and paramilitary movements of the 1970s and 1980s , beginning with the california rangers and the posse comitatus , and he also helped found the american militia movement due to the promotion of christian identity doctrines through radio and later through the internet , an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold christian identity beliefs it is a white supremacist theology that promotes a racial interpretation of christianity christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered europeans to be the chosen people and jews to be the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' ( or serpent seed ) ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) wesley swift formulated the doctrine that non-caucasian peoples have no souls and therefore can never earn god 's favor or be saved no single document expresses the christian identity belief system ; there is much disagreement over the doctrines which are taught by those who ascribe to ci beliefs , since there is no central organization or headquarters for the ci sect however , all ci adherents believe that adam and his offspring were exclusively white and the other pre-adamite races are separate species , which can not be either equated with or derived from the adamites ci adherents cite passages from the old testament , including , , and , which they claim contain yahweh 's injunctions against interracial marriages christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe or caucasians in general are god 's servant people , according to the promises that were given to abraham , isaac , and jacob it further asserts that the early european tribes were really the ten lost tribes of israel and therefore the rightful heirs to god 's promises , and god 's chosen people colin kidd wrote that in the united states , christian identity exploited '' the puzzle of the ten lost tribes to justify an openly anti-semitic and virulently racist agenda '' according to michael mcfarland and glenn gottfried , they drew their racist beliefs on christianity because of its status as a traditional religion of the united states , which allowed for a common identification , and because of the variety of possible interpretations of the bible in the field of hermeneutics the christian identity movement thus seeks an alternative to violence and government change with the creation of a '' white aryan bastion '' or ethno-state , such as the northwest territorial imperative the primary distinction between british israelism and ci is that unlike christian identitarians , british israelites believe that the jews are descended from the tribe of judah in short , christian identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day jews , the true descendants of the houses of israel and judah are the modern-day anglo-saxon , celtic , germanic , nordic , and kindred peoples identity teaches that '' israel '' was the name given to jacob after he wrestled with the angel at penuel as described in genesis 32:26–32 after they were subsequently conquered by assyria at approximately 721 bc , the ten tribes disappeared from the biblical record and became known as the lost tribes of israel in cain : son of the serpent ( 1985 ) , david max eichhorn traces the idea back to early jewish midrash and he identifies many rabbis who taught the belief that cain was the son of a union between the serpent and eve , people of different races ) is seen as defiling all of them , and it is also considered a violation of god 's law before he was caught for the murders , kahl wrote a note in which he said '' our nation has fallen into the hands of alien people religion and the racist right : the origins of the christian identity movement race over grace : the racialist religion of the christian identity movement , omaha , nebraska : iuniverse press

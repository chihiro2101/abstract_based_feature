in a speech which he delivered in munich in 1920 and titled '' why we are anti-semites , '' he referred to and disparaged abraham as being racially jewish while early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo-semites , christian identity emerged in sharp contrast to british israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology in fact , british israelism had several jewish adherents , and it also received support from rabbis throughout the 19th century however , christian identity , which emerged in the 1920s , began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the jews are the descendants of satan or edomite-khazars ( see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry ) rather than the descendants of the tribe of judah ( as british israelites maintain ) around 1924 , rand began to claim that the jews are descended from esau or the canaanites rather than the tribe of judah he never went so far as to advocate the '' serpent seed '' doctrine that modern-day jews are descendants of satan ; he only claimed that they are not the lineal descendants of judah rand is considered a 'transitional ' figure from british israelism to christian identity , rather than its actual founder rand is known as the first person to coin the term 'christian identity ' in 1933 rand set up the anglo-saxon federation of america which promoted his view that the jews are not descended from judah , marking the first key transition from british israelism to christian identity beginning in may 1937 , there were key meetings of british israelites in the united states who were attracted to rand 's theory that the jews are not descended from judah these meetings provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of christian identity links between christian identity and the ku klux klan were also forged in the late 1930s , although the kkk was by then past the peak of its early twentieth-century revival christian identity began to emerge out of british israelism in the 1940s , primarily over issues of racism and anti-semitism rather than theology gale became a leading figure in the anti-tax and paramilitary movements of the 1970s and 1980s , beginning with the california rangers and the posse comitatus , and he also helped found the american militia movement swift quickly converted butler to christian identity tax evasion and militia movement organizer gordon kahl , whose death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities helped inspire the order , also had connections to the christian identity movement these groups are estimated to have two thousand members in the united states and an unknown number in canada and the rest of the british commonwealth due to the promotion of christian identity doctrines through radio and later through the internet , an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold christian identity beliefs it is a white supremacist theology that promotes a racial interpretation of christianity some christian identity churches preach more violent rhetoric than others , but all of them believe that aryans are god 's chosen race christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered europeans to be the chosen people and jews to be the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' ( or serpent seed ) ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) wesley swift formulated the doctrine that non-caucasian peoples have no souls and therefore can never earn god 's favor or be saved ci adherents cite passages from the old testament , including , , and , which they claim contain yahweh 's injunctions against interracial marriages christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe or caucasians in general are god 's servant people , according to the promises that were given to abraham , isaac , and jacob it further asserts that the early european tribes were really the ten lost tribes of israel and therefore the rightful heirs to god 's promises , and god 's chosen people colin kidd wrote that in the united states , christian identity exploited '' the puzzle of the ten lost tribes to justify an openly anti-semitic and virulently racist agenda '' according to michael mcfarland and glenn gottfried , they drew their racist beliefs on christianity because of its status as a traditional religion of the united states , which allowed for a common identification , and because of the variety of possible interpretations of the bible in the field of hermeneutics while they seek to introduce a state of racial purity in the us , christian identitarians do not trust the congress or the government , allegedly controlled by jews , to support their agenda identity teaches that '' israel '' was the name given to jacob after he wrestled with the angel at penuel as described in genesis 32:26â€“32 , people of different races ) is seen as defiling all of them , and it is also considered a violation of god 's law the first documents which advocated christian identity 's views on racial politics and economics were written by howard rand and william j gordon kahl was the first ci believer who took the founding principles from rand and cameron , and applied them in order to take action against the government unlike many protestant fundamentalists , christian identity adherents reject the notion of a rapture , based on their belief that it is a judaized doctrine which the bible does not teach christian identity : the aryan american bloodline religion

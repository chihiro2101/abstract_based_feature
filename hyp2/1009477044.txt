the christian identity movement emerged in the united states in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of british israelism however , adolf hitler did not subscribe to the belief that the israelites of the bible were aryans ; in a speech which he delivered in munich in 1920 and titled '' why we are anti-semites , '' he referred to and disparaged abraham as being racially jewish while early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo-semites , christian identity emerged in sharp contrast to british israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology within british politics it supported benjamin disraeli , who was descended from sephardi jews however , christian identity , which emerged in the 1920s , began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the jews are the descendants of satan or edomite-khazars ( see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry ) rather than the descendants of the tribe of judah ( as british israelites maintain ) rather , its adherents believed that modern-day jews were only descended from the tribes of judah and benjamin , while the british and other related northern european peoples were descended from the other ten tribes an early book which advanced the ideas of british israelism was lost israel found in the anglo-saxon race by e.p rand is known as the first person to coin the term 'christian identity ' in 1933 rand set up the anglo-saxon federation of america which promoted his view that the jews are not descended from judah , marking the first key transition from british israelism to christian identity beginning in may 1937 , there were key meetings of british israelites in the united states who were attracted to rand 's theory that the jews are not descended from judah by the late 1930s , the group 's members considered jews to be the offspring of satan and demonized them , and they also demonized non-caucasian races william dudley pelley , the founder of the clerical fascism silver shirts movement , was influenced by british israelism in the early 1930s links between christian identity and the ku klux klan were also forged in the late 1930s , although the kkk was by then past the peak of its early twentieth-century revival christian identity began to emerge out of british israelism in the 1940s , primarily over issues of racism and anti-semitism rather than theology wesley swift ( 1913–1970 ) is considered to be the father of the movement ; so much so that every anti-defamation league publication addressing christian identity mentions him '' in 1946 , he founded his own church in lancaster , california and named it the anglo-saxon christian congregation , reflecting the influence of howard rand eventually , the name of his church was changed to the church of jesus christ–christian , which is used today by aryan nations due to the promotion of christian identity doctrines through radio and later through the internet , an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold christian identity beliefs christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered europeans to be the chosen people and jews to be the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' ( or serpent seed ) ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) wesley swift formulated the doctrine that non-caucasian peoples have no souls and therefore can never earn god 's favor or be saved however , all ci adherents believe that adam and his offspring were exclusively white and the other pre-adamite races are separate species , which can not be either equated with or derived from the adamites christian identity adherents assert that the white people of europe or caucasians in general are god 's servant people , according to the promises that were given to abraham , isaac , and jacob colin kidd wrote that in the united states , christian identity exploited '' the puzzle of the ten lost tribes to justify an openly anti-semitic and virulently racist agenda '' according to michael mcfarland and glenn gottfried , they drew their racist beliefs on christianity because of its status as a traditional religion of the united states , which allowed for a common identification , and because of the variety of possible interpretations of the bible in the field of hermeneutics the christian identity movement thus seeks an alternative to violence and government change with the creation of a '' white aryan bastion '' or ethno-state , such as the northwest territorial imperative like british israelites , christian identity ( ci ) adherents believe in two house theology , which makes a distinction between the tribe of judah and the ten lost tribes in short , christian identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day jews , the true descendants of the houses of israel and judah are the modern-day anglo-saxon , celtic , germanic , nordic , and kindred peoples in 975 bc the ten northern tribes revolted , seceded from the south , and became the kingdom of israel after they were subsequently conquered by assyria at approximately 721 bc , the ten tribes disappeared from the biblical record and became known as the lost tribes of israel thus anglo-saxons are the true israelites , god 's chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the second coming of christ a major tenet of christian identity is the pre-adamite hypothesis while christian identity adherents generally subscribe to traditional christian views on the role of women and abortion , they distinguish themselves from mainstream protestant fundamentalism in various areas of christian theology some christian identity writers criticize modern bible translations as well as the jews for their removal of the original hebrew name of god from the bible unlike many protestant fundamentalists , christian identity adherents reject the notion of a rapture , based on their belief that it is a judaized doctrine which the bible does not teach god and race : british-israelism and christian identity , p

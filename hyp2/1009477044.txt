the christian identity movement emerged in the united states in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot of british israelism the idea that '' lower races '' are mentioned in the bible ( in contrast to aryans ) was posited in the 1905 book theozoology ; or the science of the sodomite apelings and the divine electron by jörg lanz von liebenfels , an ariosophy and a volkisch writer who is seen by historians as having influenced nazism however , adolf hitler did not subscribe to the belief that the israelites of the bible were aryans ; in a speech which he delivered in munich in 1920 and titled '' why we are anti-semites , '' he referred to and disparaged abraham as being racially jewish while early british israelites such as edward hine and john wilson were philo-semites , christian identity emerged in sharp contrast to british israelism as a strongly antisemitic theology the anti-defamation league ( adl ) describes the emergence of christian identity from british israelism as an 'ugly turn ' : another source describes the emergence of christian identity from british israelism as a '' remarkable transition , '' because traditional british israelites were advocates of philo-semitism which paradoxically changed to antisemitism and racism under christian identity in fact , british israelism had several jewish adherents , and it also received support from rabbis throughout the 19th century however , christian identity , which emerged in the 1920s , began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the jews are the descendants of satan or edomite-khazars ( see khazar hypothesis of ashkenazi ancestry ) rather than the descendants of the tribe of judah ( as british israelites maintain ) rather , its adherents believed that modern-day jews were only descended from the tribes of judah and benjamin , while the british and other related northern european peoples were descended from the other ten tribes he never went so far as to advocate the '' serpent seed '' doctrine that modern-day jews are descendants of satan ; he only claimed that they are not the lineal descendants of judah rand is considered a 'transitional ' figure from british israelism to christian identity , rather than its actual founder rand is known as the first person to coin the term 'christian identity ' in 1933 rand set up the anglo-saxon federation of america which promoted his view that the jews are not descended from judah , marking the first key transition from british israelism to christian identity these meetings provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of christian identity christian identity began to emerge out of british israelism in the 1940s , primarily over issues of racism and anti-semitism rather than theology wesley swift ( 1913–1970 ) is considered to be the father of the movement ; so much so that every anti-defamation league publication addressing christian identity mentions him future aryan nations founder richard girnt butler , who was an admirer of both adolf hitler and wisconsin senator joseph mccarthy , was introduced to wesley swift by william potter gale in 1962 when swift died in 1971 , butler fought gale , james warner , and swift 's own widow for control of the church lesser figures participated as christian identity theology took shape in the 1940s and 1950s , such as san jacinto capt , a baptist minister and california klansman ( who claimed that he had introduced wesley swift to christian identity ) ; and bertrand comparet ( 1901–1983 ) , a one-time san diego deputy city attorney ( and a lawyer for gerald l the movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993 , in the wake of the deadly ruby ridge confrontation , when newspapers discovered that former green beret and right-wing separatist randy weaver had at least a loose association with christian identity believers rather than being an organized religion , christian identity ( '' ci '' ) is adhered to by individuals , local church and some prison gangs some christian identity churches preach more violent rhetoric than others , but all of them believe that aryans are god 's chosen race christian identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered europeans to be the chosen people and jews to be the cursed offspring of cain , the '' serpent hybrid '' ( or serpent seed ) ( a belief which is known as the two-seedline doctrine ) no single document expresses the christian identity belief system ; there is much disagreement over the doctrines which are taught by those who ascribe to ci beliefs , since there is no central organization or headquarters for the ci sect it further asserts that the early european tribes were really the ten lost tribes of israel and therefore the rightful heirs to god 's promises , and god 's chosen people while they seek to introduce a state of racial purity in the us , christian identitarians do not trust the congress or the government , allegedly controlled by jews , to support their agenda the christian identity movement thus seeks an alternative to violence and government change with the creation of a '' white aryan bastion '' or ethno-state , such as the northwest territorial imperative like british israelites , christian identity ( ci ) adherents believe in two house theology , which makes a distinction between the tribe of judah and the ten lost tribes the primary distinction between british israelism and ci is that unlike christian identitarians , british israelites believe that the jews are descended from the tribe of judah in short , christian identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day jews , the true descendants of the houses of israel and judah are the modern-day anglo-saxon , celtic , germanic , nordic , and kindred peoples identity teaches that '' israel '' was the name given to jacob after he wrestled with the angel at penuel as described in genesis 32:26–32 christian identity adherents believe that adam and eve were only the ancestors of white people , because according to christian identity , adam and eve were preceded by lesser , non-caucasian races which are often ( although not always ) identified as '' beasts of the field '' in the serpent seed idea , which ascribes the ancestry of legendary monsters such as grendel to cain , was somewhat widespread in the middle ages some ci adherents believe that jews are genetically compelled to carry on a white genocide conspiracy theory by their satanic or edomite ancestry and they also believe that the jews of today have achieved almost complete control of the earth through their claim to hold the white race 's status as god 's chosen people in accordance with this doctrine , tax refunds should be applied to family vacation trips or they should be applied to national festivals which are observed by adherents of christian identity unlike many protestant fundamentalists , christian identity adherents reject the notion of a rapture , based on their belief that it is a judaized doctrine which the bible does not teach

little orphan annie displays literary kinship with the picaresque novel in its seemingly endless string of episodic and unrelated adventures in the life of a character who wanders like an innocent vagabond through a corrupt world in annie 's first year , the picaresque pattern that characterizes her story is set , with the major players – annie , sandy and '' daddy '' warbucks – introduced within the strip 's first several weeks warbucks takes annie into her home '' on trial '' her husband oliver , who returned from a business trip , instantly develops a paternal affection for annie and instructs her to address him as '' daddy '' originally , the warbucks had a dog named one-lung , who liked annie warbucks sends annie back to '' the home '' numerous times , and the staff hates her for that a very status-conscious woman , she feels that oliver and annie are ruining her socially however , oliver usually is able to put her in her place , especially when she criticizes annie the strip developed a series of formulas that ran over its course to facilitate a wide range of stories the earlier strips relied on a formula by which daddy warbucks is called away on business and through a variety of contrivances , annie is cast out of the warbucks mansion , usually by her enemy , the nasty mrs annie then wanders the countryside and has adventures meeting and helping new people in their daily struggles early stories dealt with political corruption , criminal gangs and corrupt institutions , which annie would confront in the series , each strip represented a single day in the life of the characters annie remained an orphan , and for several years had adventures that involved more internationally based enemies the contemporary events taking place in europe were reflected in the strips during the 1940s and world war ii by this time , the series enlarged its world with the addition of characters such as asp and punjab , bodyguards and servants to annie and daddy warbucks her distinguishing physical characteristics are a mop of red , curly hair , a red dress and vacant circles for eyes sandy enters the story in a january 1925 strip as a puppy of no particular breed which annie rescues from a gang of abusive boys she finally gives him to paddy lynch , a gentle man who owns a '' steak joint '' and can give sandy a good home oliver '' daddy ''

medill patterson into an important national journal gray 's strips were consistently rejected by patterson , but little orphan annie was finally accepted and debuted in a test run on august 5 , 1924 , in the new york daily news , a tribune-owned tabloid '' i talked to this little kid and liked her right away '' , gray said i chose annie for mine , and made her an orphan , so she 'd have no family , no tangling alliances , but freedom to go where she pleased '' by changing the gender of his lead character , gray differentiated himself in the field of comics ( and likely increased his readership by appealing to female readers ) predictably , gray was reviled by some for preaching in the strip to the poor about hard work , initiative , and motivation while living well on his income a new three-panel gag strip about an elderly lady , maw green , began on january 1 , 1933 , and ran along the bottom of the sunday page until 1973 in 1935 punjab , a gigantic , sword-wielding , beturbaned indian , was introduced to the strip and became one of its iconic characters many , including gray , saw this and other programs as government interference in private enterprise but following fdr 's death , gray brought back warbucks , who said to annie , '' somehow i feel that the climate here has changed since i went away '' ) annie 's life was complicated not only by thugs and gangsters but also by new deal do-gooders and bureaucrats organized labor was feared by businessmen and gray took their side the new republic described annie as '' hooverism in the funnies '' , arguing that gray 's strip was defending utility company bosses then being investigated by the government a subsequent new republic editorial praised the paper 's move , and the nation likewise voiced its support warbucks persuades the politician to use his influence with the judge and make sure that the trial goes their way and that mack and his men get their just deserts in another sunday strip , published during world war ii , a war-profiteer expresses the hope that the conflict would last another 20 years an outraged member of the public physically assaults the man for his opinion , claiming revenge for his two sons who have already been killed in the fighting as war clouds gathered , both the chicago tribune and the new york daily news advocated neutrality ; '' daddy '' warbucks , however , was gleefully manufacturing tanks , planes , and munitions '' when the us entered world war ii , annie not only played her part by blowing up a german submarine but organized and led groups of children called the junior commandos in the collection of newspapers , scrap metal , and other recyclable materials for the war effort annie herself wore an armband emblazoned with '' jc '' and called herself '' colonel annie '' editor & publisher wrote , harold gray , little orphan annie creator , has done one of the biggest jobs to date for the scrap drive his 'junior commando ' project , which he inaugurated some months ago , has caught on all around the country , and tons of scrap have been collected and contributed to the campaign gray was criticized by a southern newspaper for including a black youngster among the white children in the junior commandos following roosevelt 's death in april 1945 , gray resurrected warbucks ( who was only playing dead to thwart his enemies ) and once again the billionaire began expounding the joys of capitalism '' his belief brought upon him the wrath of the labor movement , which staunchly supported the child labor laws a london newspaper columnist thought some of gray 's sequences a threat to world peace , but a detroit newspaper supported gray on his '' shoot first , ask questions later '' foreign policy gray responded to the criticism by giving annie a year-long bout with amnesia that allowed her to trip through several adventures without daddy the syndicate ordered gray to drop the sequence and develop another adventure

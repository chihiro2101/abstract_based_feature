the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly urea alone is very stable due to the resonance forms it can adopt the active site of ureases is located in the α ( alpha ) subunits some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site , which gate for the substrate cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes , which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis , although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases this leaves a carbamate ion coordinated to the 5-coordinate ni , which is then displaced by a water molecule , regenerating the enzyme the carbamate produced then spontaneously degrades to produce another ammonia and carbonic acid the mechanism proposed by ciurli and mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site one of which binds and activates urea , the other nickel ion binds and activates the nucleophilic water molecule it approaches the six-coordinated nickel ( ni2 ) with one of its amino groups and subsequently bridges the two nickel centers helicobacter pylori are microbial ureases found in the stomach urease in peptic ulcers helicobacter pylori is also the cause of peptic ulcers with its manifestation in 55–68 % reported cases heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication , despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases , and thus usually does not persist , an opportunistic fungus helicobacter pylori certain enteric bacteria including proteus spp jack bean , watermelon , and pea have all proven useful sources of urease .

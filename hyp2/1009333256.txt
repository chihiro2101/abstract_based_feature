the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly the active site of ureases is located in the α ( alpha ) subunits some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site , which gate for the substrate cysteine residues are common in the flap region of the enzymes , which have been determined not to be essential in catalysis , although involved in positioning other key residues in the active site appropriately when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases the binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed one mechanism for the catalysis of this reaction by urease was proposed by blakely and zerner a pair of electrons from the nitrogen-carbon double bond returns to the nitrogen and neutralizes the charge on it , while the now 4-coordinate carbon assumes an intermediate tetrahedral orientation while the majority of the his 320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms ( protonated and deprotonated , respectively , ) it was calculated that approximately 0.3 % of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time the mechanism proposed by ciurli and mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site with regards to this proposal , urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‘ flap ’ ( which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site ) is open it approaches the six-coordinated nickel ( ni2 ) with one of its amino groups and subsequently bridges the two nickel centers the ala α170 and ala α366 are now oriented in a way that their carbonyl groups act as hydrogen-bond acceptors towards nh 2 group of urea , thus aiding its binding to ni2 helicobacter pylori are microbial ureases found in the stomach as ureases they hydrolyze urea to produce ammonia and carbonic acid in the absence of plants , urease activity in soil is generally attributed to heterotrophic microorganisms , although it has been demonstrated that some chemoautotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria are capable of growth on urea as a sole source of carbon , nitrogen , and energy

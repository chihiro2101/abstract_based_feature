the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly the active site of ureases is located in the α ( alpha ) subunits some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site , which gate for the substrate in sporosarcina pasteurii urease , the flap was found in the open conformation , while its closed conformation is apparently needed for the reaction when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases the binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed one mechanism for the catalysis of this reaction by urease was proposed by blakely and zerner it begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate ni ( ni-1 ) blakeley and zerner proposed this nearby group to be a carboxylate , although deprotonated carboxylates are negatively charged while the majority of the his 320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms ( protonated and deprotonated , respectively , ) it was calculated that approximately 0.3 % of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time urea binds to the five-coordinated nickel ( ni1 ) with the carbonyl oxygen atom the binding of the urea carbonyl oxygen atom to ni1 is stabilized through the protonation state of his α222 nԑ the ala α170 and ala α366 are now oriented in a way that their carbonyl groups act as hydrogen-bond acceptors towards nh 2 group of urea , thus aiding its binding to ni2 as ureases they hydrolyze urea to produce ammonia and carbonic acid heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication , despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases , and thus usually does not persist many gastrointestinal or urinary tract pathogens produce urease , enabling the detection of urease to be used as a diagnostic to detect presence of pathogens

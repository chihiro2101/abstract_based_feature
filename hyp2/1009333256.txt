the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly the active site of ureases is located in the α ( alpha ) subunits some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site , which gate for the substrate when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases the binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed one mechanism for the catalysis of this reaction by urease was proposed by blakely and zerner it begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate ni ( ni-1 ) the mechanism follows the same path , with the general base omitted ( as there is no more need for it ) and his 320 donating its proton to form the ammonia molecule , which is then released from the enzyme while the majority of the his 320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms ( protonated and deprotonated , respectively , ) it was calculated that approximately 0.3 % of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time the mechanism proposed by ciurli and mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site with regards to this proposal , urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‘ flap ’ ( which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site ) is open stability of the binding of urea to the active site is achieved via a hydrogen-bonding network , orienting the substrate into the catalytic cavity urea binds to the five-coordinated nickel ( ni1 ) with the carbonyl oxygen atom helicobacter pylori are microbial ureases found in the stomach as ureases they hydrolyze urea to produce ammonia and carbonic acid heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication , despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases , and thus usually does not persist

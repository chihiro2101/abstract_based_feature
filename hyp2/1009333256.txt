the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly urea substrate is proposed to displace aquo ligands water molecules located towards the opening of the active site form a tetrahedral cluster that fills the cavity site through hydrogen bonds some amino acid residues are proposed to form mobile flap of the site , which gate for the substrate in sporosarcina pasteurii urease , the flap was found in the open conformation , while its closed conformation is apparently needed for the reaction the binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed it begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate ni ( ni-1 ) aerogenes urease , it was argued that the general base used in the blakely mechanism , his 320 , was too far away from the ni2-bound water to deprotonate in order to form the attacking hydroxide moiety while the majority of the his 320 ligands and bound water will not be in their active forms ( protonated and deprotonated , respectively , ) it was calculated that approximately 0.3 % of total urease enzyme would be active at any one time the mechanism proposed by ciurli and mangani is one of the more recent and currently accepted views of the mechanism of urease and is based primarily on the different roles of the two nickel ions in the active site with regards to this proposal , urea enters the active site cavity when the mobile ‘ flap ’ ( which allows for the entrance of urea into the active site ) is open stability of the binding of urea to the active site is achieved via a hydrogen-bonding network , orienting the substrate into the catalytic cavity additionally , the conformational change from the open to closed state of the mobile flap generates a rearrangement of ala α222 carbonyl group in such a way that its oxygen atom points to ni2 the ala α170 and ala α366 are now oriented in a way that their carbonyl groups act as hydrogen-bond acceptors towards nh 2 group of urea , thus aiding its binding to ni2 urea is a very poor chelating ligand due to low lewis base character of its nh 2 groups however the carbonyl oxygens of ala α170 and ala α366 enhance the basicity of the nh 2 groups and allow for binding to ni2

the k cat /k m of urease in the processing of urea is 10 14 times greater than the rate of the uncatalyzed elimination reaction of urea the proximity of urea to active groups in the active site along with the correct orientation of urea allow hydrolysis to occur rapidly the active site of ureases is located in the α ( alpha ) subunits when compared , the α subunits of helicobacter pylori urease and other bacterial ureases align with the jack bean ureases the binding of urea to the active site of urease has not been observed one mechanism for the catalysis of this reaction by urease was proposed by blakely and zerner it begins with a nucleophilic attack by the carbonyl oxygen of the urea molecule onto the 5-coordinate ni ( ni-1 ) the breakdown of this intermediate is then helped by a sulfhydryl group of a cysteine located near the active site a hydrogen bonds to one of the nitrogen atoms , breaking its bond with carbon , and releasing an nh3 molecule placing the his 320 ligand as an essential component in the mechanism also takes into account the mobile flap region of the enzyme stability of the binding of urea to the active site is achieved via a hydrogen-bonding network , orienting the substrate into the catalytic cavity urea binds to the five-coordinated nickel ( ni1 ) with the carbonyl oxygen atom it approaches the six-coordinated nickel ( ni2 ) with one of its amino groups and subsequently bridges the two nickel centers as ureases they hydrolyze urea to produce ammonia and carbonic acid heavy use of urea is thought to promote eutrophication , despite the observation that urea is rapidly transformed by microbial ureases , and thus usually does not persist environmental urease activity is often measured as an indicator of the health of microbial communities jack bean , watermelon , and pea have all proven useful sources of urease .

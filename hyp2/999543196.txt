tradition , as retailed by grindal 's biographer john strype , had long held that grindal was born in hensingham , now a suburb of whitehaven john strype ( 1710 ) , life and acts of edmund grindal , archbishop of canterbury however modern scholarship has shown that his birthplace was in fact cross hill house , st bees , cumberland patrick collinson , ‘ grindal , edmund ( 1516x20–1583 ) ’ , oxford dictionary of national biography , oxford university press , 2004 ; online edn , jan 2008 , accessed 26 june 2013 '' archbishop grindal 's birthplace : cross hill , st patrick collinson – '' archbishop grindal 1519–1583 the struggle for a reformed church '' 1979 that both grindal and edwin sandys shared a childhood , quite probably in st bees edwin sandys kept one step behind grindal in their subsequent careers , succeeding him as bishop of london , and then as archbishop of york whatever the place of early education , it is known that the marian martyr john bland was the schoolmaster of sandys , so it is likely he would also have taught grindal grindal was educated at magdalene and christ 's colleges and then at pembroke hall , cambridge , where he graduated ba and was elected a fellow in 1538 when ridley became bishop of london , he made grindal one of his chaplains and gave him the precentorship of st paul 's cathedral according to john knox , grindal distinguished himself from most of the court preachers in 1553 by denouncing the worldliness of courtiers and foretelling the evils that would follow the king 's death grindal benefited greatly from the patronage of ridley and sir william cecil during this period , to the extent that on 11 june 1553 he was nominated to be bishop of london although grindal was not politically compromised by the events surrounding the accession of mary i in october 1553 , he had resigned his westminster prebend by 10 may 1554 , and made his way to strasbourg as one of the marian exiles 269 and in october 1562 he wrote to william cecil , begging to know '' if that second julian , the king of navarre , is killed ; as he intended to preach at st paul 's cross , and might take occasion to mention god 's judgements on him '' grindal lacked that firm faith in the supreme importance of uniformity and autocracy which enabled john whitgift to persecute nonconformists whose theology was identical to his own london , which was always a difficult see , involved bishop sandys in similar troubles when grindal had gone to york grindal was appointed archbishop of canterbury on 26 july 1575 , though there is no actual proof that the new archbishop ever visited the seat of his see , canterbury , not even for his enthronement henry sacheverell , in his famous sermon of 5 november 1709 , '' the perils of false brethren , both in church and state '' , attacked him as '' that false son of the church , bishop grindall john strype ( 1710 ) , life and acts of edmund grindal , archbishop of canterbury patrick collinson , '' archbishop grindal 1519–1583 : the struggle for a reformed church '' , 1979 , dictionary of national biography p collinson ( 1971 ) ' e london : archibald constable stanford lehmberg archbishop grindal and the prophesyings , historical magazine of the protestant episcopal church peter iver kaufman ; journal of american church history , vol

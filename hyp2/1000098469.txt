astronomer william keel explains : the cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'viewed on a sufficiently large scale , the properties of the universe are the same for all observers the cosmological principle depends on a definition of '' observer , '' and contains an implicit qualification and two testable consequences '' observers '' means any observer at any location in the universe , not simply any human observer at any location on earth : as andrew liddle puts it , '' the cosmological principle means that the universe looks the same whoever and wherever you are the two testable structural consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe ( '' the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample '' ) at extreme cosmological distances , the property of mechanical equilibrium in surfaces lateral to the line of sight can be empirically tested ; however , under the assumption of the cosmological principle , it can not be detected parallel to the line of sight ( see timeline of the universe ) eddington : thus , a non-static universe is also implied , independent of observations of distant galaxies , as the result of applying the cosmological principle to general relativity while the isotropy of the universe around earth is confirmed at high significance by studies of the cosmic microwave background temperature maps , its homogeneity over cosmological scales is still a matter of debate the perfect cosmological principle is an extension of the cosmological principle , and states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space and time

the life of muhammad or sira generated both the qur'an ( revelation ) and hadith ( his daily utterances and discourses ) , during which philosophy was defined by muslims as consisting in acceptance or rejection of his message key figures are imam ahmad ibn hanbal , imam bukhari , imam muslim , al-tirmidhi , ibn majah , abu dawud and al-nasa ' i ilm al-kalām , literally the study of '' speech '' or '' words '' ) is the islamic philosophy discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic kalām in islamic practice relates to the discipline of seeking theological knowledge through debate and argument with kalam , questions about the sira and hadith , as well as science ( islamic science ) and law ( fiqh and sharia ) , began to be investigated beyond the scope of muhammad 's beliefs this period is characterized by emergence of ijtihad and the first fiqh as the sunnah became published and accepted , philosophy separate from muslim theology was discouraged due to a lack of participants during this period , traditions similar to socratic method began to evolve , but philosophy remained subordinate to religion independent minds exploiting the methods of ijtihad sought to investigate the doctrines of the qur'an , which until then had been accepted in faith on the authority of divine revelation all knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason ; humans could acquire knowledge before , as well as after , revelation , by the sole light of reason the first mutakallamin had to debate both the orthodox and the non-muslims , and they may be described as occupying the middle ground between those two parties jewish and muslim peripatetics , generally , stopped short in their respective aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion from spain arabic philosophic literature was translated into hebrew and latin , contributing to the development of modern european philosophy the philosophers maimonides ( a jew born in al andalus ) and ibn khaldun ( born in modern-day tunisia ) , the father of sociology and historiography , were also important philosophers , though the latter did not identify himself as a falsafa , but rather a kalam author one other part of aristotle 's theory shocked the faith of the mutakallamin & mdash ; the aristotelian theory of the soul according to aristotelianism , the human soul is simply man 's substantial form , the set of properties that make matter into a living human body '' this intellect is separate , unaffected , and unmixed in separation , it is just what it is , and this alone is immortal and eternal '' ( de anima 430a18 , 23-24 ) but this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter this supreme exaltation of philosophy may be attributed , in great measure , to al-ghazali ( 1005–1111 ) among the persians , and to judah ha-levi ( 1140 ) among the jews the influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the islamic peripatetic school ever produced , namely , ibn bajjah ( avempace ) and ibn rushd ( averroes ) , both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy he passes severe censure upon the mutakallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy then he reduced the chief propositions of the mutakallamin , to prove the unity of god , to ten in number , describing them at length , and concluding in these terms : '' does the kalam give us more information concerning god and his attributes than the prophet did ? '' ( ib ) aristotelianism finds no favor in judah ha-levi 's eyes , for it is no less given to details and criticism ; neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat , owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament averroes ( averroës ) , the contemporary of maimonides , closed the first great philosophical era of the muslims the theories of ibn rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of ibn bajjah and ibn tufail , who only follow the teachings of ibn sina ( avicenna ) and al-farabi his ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion , further developed by the averroism school of philosophy , were later influential in the development of modern secularism thus he says , '' not only is matter eternal , but form is potentially inherent in matter ; otherwise , it were a creation ex nihilo '' ( munk , '' mélanges '' , p according to this theory , therefore , the existence of this world is not only a possibility , as ibn sina declared & mdash ; in order to make concessions to the orthodox & mdash ; but also a necessity the works of ibn rushd especially became the subject of their study , due in great measure to maimonides , who , in a letter addressed to his pupil joseph ben judah , spoke in the highest terms of ibn rushd 's commentary their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on islamic philosophy , especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as ibn sina and of western thinkers such as ibn rushd henry corbin , history of islamic philosophy in this work saadia treats the questions that interested the mutakallamin , such as the creation of matter , the unity of god , the divine attributes , the soul , etc only the attributes of essence ( sifat al-dhatia ) can be ascribed to god , but not the attributes of action ( sifat-al-fi'aliya ) 74 ) , and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position : '' only a substance can be the substratum of an accident '' ( that is , of a non-essential property of things ) al-farabi ( alfarabi ) was a founder of his own school of islamic philosophy but which was later overshadowed by avicennism in his attempt to think through the nature of a first cause , alfarabi discovers the limits of human knowledge '' due to avicenna 's ( ibn sina 's ) successful reconciliation between aristotelianism and neoplatonism along with kalam , avicennism eventually became the leading school of islamic philosophy by the 12th century avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then , and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time : nahyan a avicennism was also influential in medieval europe , particularly his doctrines on the nature of the soul and his existence-essence distinction , along with the debates and censure that they raised in scholasticism several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the qur'an , such as the following : s ibn al-nafis described his book theologus autodidactus as a defense of '' the system of islam and the muslims ' doctrines on the missions of prophets , the religious laws , the resurrection of the body , and the transitoriness of the world conrad ( 1996 ) , the world of ibn tufayl : interdisciplinary perspectives on ḥayy ibn yaqẓān , pp islamic philosophy modern islamic philosophy islamic science islamic golden age peripatetic school sufi philosophy

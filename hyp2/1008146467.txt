the life of muhammad or sira generated both the qur'an ( revelation ) and hadith ( his daily utterances and discourses ) , during which philosophy was defined by muslims as consisting in acceptance or rejection of his message together the sira and hadith constitute the sunnah and are validated by isnad ( '' backing '' ) to determine the likely truth of the report of any given saying of muhammad key figures are imam ahmad ibn hanbal , imam bukhari , imam muslim , al-tirmidhi , ibn majah , abu dawud and al-nasa ' i this work , which was not completed until the 10th century , began shortly after the farewell sermon in 631 ilm al-kalām , literally the study of '' speech '' or '' words '' ) is the islamic philosophy discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic kalām in islamic practice relates to the discipline of seeking theological knowledge through debate and argument with kalam , questions about the sira and hadith , as well as science ( islamic science ) and law ( fiqh and sharia ) , began to be investigated beyond the scope of muhammad 's beliefs as the sunnah became published and accepted , philosophy separate from muslim theology was discouraged due to a lack of participants during this period , traditions similar to socratic method began to evolve , but philosophy remained subordinate to religion at the 2nd century of the hijra , a new movement arose in the theological school of basra , iraq all knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason ; humans could acquire knowledge before , as well as after , revelation , by the sole light of reason this fact makes knowledge obligatory upon all men , at all times , and in all places this appellation became the common name for all seeking philosophical demonstration in confirmation of religious principles from the 9th century onward , owing to caliph al-ma'mun and his successor , greek philosophy was introduced among the arabs , and the peripatetic school began to find able representatives among them ; such were al-kindi , al-farabi , avicenna , and averroes , all of whose fundamental principles were considered as criticized by the mutakallamin three speculative thinkers , al-farabi , avicenna and al-kindi , combined aristotelianism and neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through islam they were considered by many as highly unorthodox and a few even described them as non-islamic philosophers the philosophers maimonides ( a jew born in al andalus ) and ibn khaldun ( born in modern-day tunisia ) , the father of sociology and historiography , were also important philosophers , though the latter did not identify himself as a falsafa , but rather a kalam author to assert that god 's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe , and not to individual and accidental things , is tantamount to denying prophecy one other part of aristotle 's theory shocked the faith of the mutakallamin & mdash ; the aristotelian theory of the soul however , according to many interpretations , the active intellect is a superhuman entity emanating from god and enlightening the human mind , not a part of any individual human soul wherefore the mutakallamin had , before anything else , to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter , and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by democritus originally atoms were created by god , and are created now as occasion seems to require the creation of the world once established , it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a creator , and that god is unique , omnipotent , and omniscient the 12th century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the kalam , which later , being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox , perished for lack of champions the influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the islamic peripatetic school ever produced , namely , ibn bajjah ( avempace ) and ibn rushd ( averroes ) , both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy averroes ( averroës ) , the contemporary of maimonides , closed the first great philosophical era of the muslims the theories of ibn rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of ibn bajjah and ibn tufail , who only follow the teachings of ibn sina ( avicenna ) and al-farabi thus he says , '' not only is matter eternal , but form is potentially inherent in matter ; otherwise , it were a creation ex nihilo '' ( munk , '' mélanges '' , p driven from the islamic schools , islamic philosophy found a refuge with the jews , to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the christian world the works of ibn rushd especially became the subject of their study , due in great measure to maimonides , who , in a letter addressed to his pupil joseph ben judah , spoke in the highest terms of ibn rushd 's commentary the oldest jewish religio-philosophical work preserved is that of saadia gaon ( 892-942 ) , emunot ve-deot , '' the book of beliefs and opinions '' in this work saadia treats the questions that interested the mutakallamin , such as the creation of matter , the unity of god , the divine attributes , the soul , etc here saadia controverts the mutakallamin , who considered the soul an '' accident '' arad ( compare guide for the perplexed i 74 ) , and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position : '' only a substance can be the substratum of an accident '' ( that is , of a non-essential property of things ) al-farabi ( alfarabi ) was a founder of his own school of islamic philosophy but which was later overshadowed by avicennism moves from metaphysics to methodology , a move that anticipates modernity '' , and '' at the level of philosophy , alfarabi unites theory and practice due to avicenna 's ( ibn sina 's ) successful reconciliation between aristotelianism and neoplatonism along with kalam , avicennism eventually became the leading school of islamic philosophy by the 12th century the concept of '' existence precedes essence '' , a key foundational concept of existentialism , can also be found in the works of averroes , as a reaction to avicenna 's concept of '' essence precedes existence '' ibn al-nafis as a philosopher , encyclopedia of islamic world ) however , while hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in philosophus autodidactus , the story of kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in theologus autodidactus , developing into the first example of a science fiction novel later islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the metaphysics claim of avicenna and ibn tufail that bodily resurrection can not be proven through reason , a view that was earlier criticized by al-ghazali this view was challenged by the mutazilite philosophers , who held a more secular view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the caliphate islamic political philosophy , was , indeed , rooted in the very sources of islam , i.e islamic philosophy modern islamic philosophy islamic science islamic golden age peripatetic school sufi philosophy

the life of muhammad or sira generated both the qur'an ( revelation ) and hadith ( his daily utterances and discourses ) , during which philosophy was defined by muslims as consisting in acceptance or rejection of his message together the sira and hadith constitute the sunnah and are validated by isnad ( '' backing '' ) to determine the likely truth of the report of any given saying of muhammad key figures are imam ahmad ibn hanbal , imam bukhari , imam muslim , al-tirmidhi , ibn majah , abu dawud and al-nasa ' i this work , which was not completed until the 10th century , began shortly after the farewell sermon in 631 ilm al-kalām , literally the study of '' speech '' or '' words '' ) is the islamic philosophy discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic kalām in islamic practice relates to the discipline of seeking theological knowledge through debate and argument with kalam , questions about the sira and hadith , as well as science ( islamic science ) and law ( fiqh and sharia ) , began to be investigated beyond the scope of muhammad 's beliefs this period is characterized by emergence of ijtihad and the first fiqh at the 2nd century of the hijra , a new movement arose in the theological school of basra , iraq this new school was called mutazilite ( from i'tazala , to separate oneself , to dissent ) that lasted from the 8th to 10th centuries its principal dogmas were three : god is an absolute unity , and no attribute can be ascribed to him the first mutakallamin had to debate both the orthodox and the non-muslims , and they may be described as occupying the middle ground between those two parties but subsequent generations were to large extent critical towards the mutazilite school , especially after formation of the asharite concepts the vast majority of the early traditional sunni muslim scholars have either criticized or prohibited it jewish and muslim peripatetics , generally , stopped short in their respective aristotelianism whenever there was danger of wounding orthodox religion another trend , represented by the brethren of purity , used aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally neoplatonic and neopythagorean world view during the abbasid caliphate a number of thinkers and scientists , some of them heterodox muslims or non-muslims , played a role in transmitting greek , hindu , and other pre-islamic knowledge to the christian west three speculative thinkers , al-farabi , avicenna and al-kindi , combined aristotelianism and neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through islam they were considered by many as highly unorthodox and a few even described them as non-islamic philosophers from spain arabic philosophic literature was translated into hebrew and latin , contributing to the development of modern european philosophy to assert that god 's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe , and not to individual and accidental things , is tantamount to denying prophecy one other part of aristotle 's theory shocked the faith of the mutakallamin & mdash ; the aristotelian theory of the soul 51 thus , aristotle 's theories seem to deny the immortality of the individual human soul wherefore the mutakallamin had , before anything else , to establish a system of philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter , and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by democritus for , indeed , if it be supposed that god commenced his work at a certain definite time by his '' will '' , and for a certain definite object , it must be admitted that he was imperfect before accomplishing his will , or before attaining his object in order to obviate this difficulty , the motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to time , and claimed that just as space is constituted of atoms and vacuum , time , likewise , is constituted of small indivisible moments the creation of the world once established , it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a creator , and that god is unique , omnipotent , and omniscient the 12th century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the kalam , which later , being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox , perished for lack of champions he passes severe censure upon the mutakallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy he says , '' i consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them '' ( '' kuzari '' , v averroes ( averroës ) , the contemporary of maimonides , closed the first great philosophical era of the muslims averroes ' philosophy was considered controversial in muslim circles his ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion , further developed by the averroism school of philosophy , were later influential in the development of modern secularism thus he says , '' not only is matter eternal , but form is potentially inherent in matter ; otherwise , it were a creation ex nihilo '' ( munk , '' mélanges '' , p according to this theory , therefore , the existence of this world is not only a possibility , as ibn sina declared & mdash ; in order to make concessions to the orthodox & mdash ; but also a necessity driven from the islamic schools , islamic philosophy found a refuge with the jews , to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the christian world the works of ibn rushd especially became the subject of their study , due in great measure to maimonides , who , in a letter addressed to his pupil joseph ben judah , spoke in the highest terms of ibn rushd 's commentary the oldest jewish religio-philosophical work preserved is that of saadia gaon ( 892-942 ) , emunot ve-deot , '' the book of beliefs and opinions '' in this work saadia treats the questions that interested the mutakallamin , such as the creation of matter , the unity of god , the divine attributes , the soul , etc to prove the unity of god , saadia uses the demonstrations of the mutakallamin and became an influential best-seller throughout western europe in the 17th and 18th centuries nawal muhammad hassan ( 1980 ) , hayy bin yaqzan and robinson crusoe : a study of an early arabic impact on english literature , al-rashid house for publication the clashes between the sunni islam and shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character islamic philosophy modern islamic philosophy islamic science islamic golden age peripatetic school sufi philosophy

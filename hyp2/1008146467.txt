the life of muhammad or sira generated both the qur'an ( revelation ) and hadith ( his daily utterances and discourses ) , during which philosophy was defined by muslims as consisting in acceptance or rejection of his message together the sira and hadith constitute the sunnah and are validated by isnad ( '' backing '' ) to determine the likely truth of the report of any given saying of muhammad key figures are imam ahmad ibn hanbal , imam bukhari , imam muslim , al-tirmidhi , ibn majah , abu dawud and al-nasa ' i this work , which was not completed until the 10th century , began shortly after the farewell sermon in 631 ilm al-kalām , literally the study of '' speech '' or '' words '' ) is the islamic philosophy discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic kalām in islamic practice relates to the discipline of seeking theological knowledge through debate and argument with kalam , questions about the sira and hadith , as well as science ( islamic science ) and law ( fiqh and sharia ) , began to be investigated beyond the scope of muhammad 's beliefs as the sunnah became published and accepted , philosophy separate from muslim theology was discouraged due to a lack of participants during this period , traditions similar to socratic method began to evolve , but philosophy remained subordinate to religion independent minds exploiting the methods of ijtihad sought to investigate the doctrines of the qur'an , which until then had been accepted in faith on the authority of divine revelation at the 2nd century of the hijra , a new movement arose in the theological school of basra , iraq this new school was called mutazilite ( from i'tazala , to separate oneself , to dissent ) that lasted from the 8th to 10th centuries the mutazilities , compelled to defend their principles against the orthodox islam of their day , looked for support in philosophy , and are one of the first to pursue a rational theology called ilm-al-kalam ( scholasticism ) ; those professing it were called mutakallamin another trend , represented by the brethren of purity , used aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally neoplatonic and neopythagorean world view one other part of aristotle 's theory shocked the faith of the mutakallamin & mdash ; the aristotelian theory of the soul anthony kenny , aquinas on mind ( london : routledge , 1993 ) , p however , according to many interpretations , the active intellect is a superhuman entity emanating from god and enlightening the human mind , not a part of any individual human soul but this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter in order to obviate this difficulty , the motekallamin extended their theory of the atoms to time , and claimed that just as space is constituted of atoms and vacuum , time , likewise , is constituted of small indivisible moments this supreme exaltation of philosophy may be attributed , in great measure , to al-ghazali ( 1005–1111 ) among the persians , and to judah ha-levi ( 1140 ) among the jews it can be argued that the attacks directed against the philosophers by al-ghazali in his work , tahafut al-falasifa ( the incoherence of the philosophers ) , not only produced , by reaction , a current favorable to philosophy , but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism the influence of this reaction brought forth the two greatest philosophers that the islamic peripatetic school ever produced , namely , ibn bajjah ( avempace ) and ibn rushd ( averroes ) , both of whom undertook the defense of philosophy then he reduced the chief propositions of the mutakallamin , to prove the unity of god , to ten in number , describing them at length , and concluding in these terms : '' does the kalam give us more information concerning god and his attributes than the prophet did ? '' ( ib he was a defender of aristotelian philosophy against ash'ari theologians led by al-ghazali averroes ' philosophy was considered controversial in muslim circles the theories of ibn rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of ibn bajjah and ibn tufail , who only follow the teachings of ibn sina ( avicenna ) and al-farabi his ideas on the separation of philosophy and religion , further developed by the averroism school of philosophy , were later influential in the development of modern secularism but while al-farabi , ibn sina ( avicenna ) , and other persian and muslim philosophers hurried , so to speak , over subjects that trenched on religious dogmas , ibn rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress a series of eminent men & mdash ; such as the ibn tibbons , narboni , gersonides & mdash ; joined in translating the arabic philosophical works into hebrew and commenting upon them saadia argues : '' if the soul be an accident only , it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom , joy , love '' , etc al-farabi 's school of philosophy '' breaks with the philosophy of plato and aristotle al-farabi had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries , and was widely considered second only to aristotle in knowledge ( alluded to by his title of '' the second teacher '' ) in his time his work , aimed at synthesis of philosophy and sufism , paved the way for the work of avicenna ( avicenna ) due to avicenna 's ( ibn sina 's ) successful reconciliation between aristotelianism and neoplatonism along with kalam , avicennism eventually became the leading school of islamic philosophy by the 12th century avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then , and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time : nahyan a avicennism was also influential in medieval europe , particularly his doctrines on the nature of the soul and his existence-essence distinction , along with the debates and censure that they raised in scholasticism nevertheless , his psychology and theory of knowledge influenced william of auvergne and albertus magnus , and his metaphysics influenced the thought of thomas aquinas nomanul haq , '' islam '' , in dale jamieson ( 2001 ) , a companion to environmental philosophy , pp he presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of arabic fiction , hence his theologus autodidactus may be considered the earliest science fiction work fiqh is the term for islamic jurisprudence , made up of the rulings of islamic jurists mainstream islam distinguish fiqh , which means understanding details and inferences drawn by scholars , from sharia that refers to principles that lie behind the fiqh russell ( 1994 ) , the 'arabick ' interest of the natural philosophers in seventeenth-century england , p the british philosopher-anthropologist ernest gellner considered ibn khaldun 's definition of government , '' an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself '' , the best in the history of political theory islamic philosophy modern islamic philosophy islamic science islamic golden age peripatetic school sufi philosophy

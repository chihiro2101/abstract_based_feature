the life of muhammad or sira generated both the qur'an ( revelation ) and hadith ( his daily utterances and discourses ) , during which philosophy was defined by muslims as consisting in acceptance or rejection of his message together the sira and hadith constitute the sunnah and are validated by isnad ( '' backing '' ) to determine the likely truth of the report of any given saying of muhammad key figures are imam ahmad ibn hanbal , imam bukhari , imam muslim , al-tirmidhi , ibn majah , abu dawud and al-nasa ' i this work , which was not completed until the 10th century , began shortly after the farewell sermon in 631 ilm al-kalām , literally the study of '' speech '' or '' words '' ) is the islamic philosophy discipline of seeking theological principles through dialectic kalām in islamic practice relates to the discipline of seeking theological knowledge through debate and argument with kalam , questions about the sira and hadith , as well as science ( islamic science ) and law ( fiqh and sharia ) , began to be investigated beyond the scope of muhammad 's beliefs this period is characterized by emergence of ijtihad and the first fiqh as the sunnah became published and accepted , philosophy separate from muslim theology was discouraged due to a lack of participants during this period , traditions similar to socratic method began to evolve , but philosophy remained subordinate to religion one of the first debates was that between the qadarites , who affirmed free will , and the jabarites , who maintained the belief in fatalism at the 2nd century of the hijra , a new movement arose in the theological school of basra , iraq this new school was called mutazilite ( from i'tazala , to separate oneself , to dissent ) that lasted from the 8th to 10th centuries all knowledge necessary for the salvation of man emanates from his reason ; humans could acquire knowledge before , as well as after , revelation , by the sole light of reason the vast majority of the early traditional sunni muslim scholars have either criticized or prohibited it three speculative thinkers , al-farabi , avicenna and al-kindi , combined aristotelianism and neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through islam they were considered by many as highly unorthodox and a few even described them as non-islamic philosophers from spain arabic philosophic literature was translated into hebrew and latin , contributing to the development of modern european philosophy to assert that god 's knowledge extends only to the general laws of the universe , and not to individual and accidental things , is tantamount to denying prophecy 24 , 26 , 28 this seems to imply that the human soul can not exist apart from the body 51 thus , aristotle 's theories seem to deny the immortality of the individual human soul originally atoms were created by god , and are created now as occasion seems to require but this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter the creation of the world once established , it was an easy matter for them to demonstrate the existence of a creator , and that god is unique , omnipotent , and omniscient the 12th century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy and the decline of the kalam , which later , being attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox , perished for lack of champions this supreme exaltation of philosophy may be attributed , in great measure , to al-ghazali ( 1005–1111 ) among the persians , and to judah ha-levi ( 1140 ) among the jews it can be argued that the attacks directed against the philosophers by al-ghazali in his work , tahafut al-falasifa ( the incoherence of the philosophers ) , not only produced , by reaction , a current favorable to philosophy , but induced the philosophers themselves to profit by his criticism this poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy , and to this end wrote the '' kuzari '' , in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike he passes severe censure upon the mutakallamin for seeking to support religion by philosophy their main point of dispute is on the influence of different philosophers on islamic philosophy , especially the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as ibn sina and of western thinkers such as ibn rushd henry corbin , history of islamic philosophy the oldest jewish religio-philosophical work preserved is that of saadia gaon ( 892-942 ) , emunot ve-deot , '' the book of beliefs and opinions '' to prove the unity of god , saadia uses the demonstrations of the mutakallamin 74 ) , and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position : '' only a substance can be the substratum of an accident '' ( that is , of a non-essential property of things ) al-farabi ( alfarabi ) was a founder of his own school of islamic philosophy but which was later overshadowed by avicennism al-farabi 's school of philosophy '' breaks with the philosophy of plato and aristotle moves from metaphysics to methodology , a move that anticipates modernity '' , and '' at the level of philosophy , alfarabi unites theory and practice due to avicenna 's ( ibn sina 's ) successful reconciliation between aristotelianism and neoplatonism along with kalam , avicennism eventually became the leading school of islamic philosophy by the 12th century avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then , and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time : nahyan a averroes ( ibn rushd ) is most famous for his commentaries on aristotle 's works and for writing the incoherence of the incoherence in which he defended the falasifa against al-ghazali 's the incoherence of the philosophers ibn al-nafis dealt with islamic eschatology in some depth in his theologus autodidactus , where he rationality the islamic view of eschatology using reason and science to explain the events that would occur according to islamic eschatology fancy ( 2006 ) , '' pulmonary transit and bodily resurrection : the interaction of medicine , philosophy and religion in the works of ibn al-nafīs ( d russell ( 1994 ) , the 'arabick ' interest of the natural philosophers in seventeenth-century england , pp islamic philosophy modern islamic philosophy islamic science islamic golden age peripatetic school sufi philosophy

'' avon '' derives from the british language , '' river '' , which also survives as a number of river avon ( disambiguation ) , and as modern welsh and breton avon , '' river '' it then flows in a generally west-southwesterly direction , passing through the towns and villages of rugby , wolston , ( bordering leamington spa ) , warwick , stratford-upon-avon , welford-on-avon , bidford-on-avon , evesham and pershore , before it joins the river severn at tewkesbury a long distance footpath has been created which follows the river from its source to the river severn at tewkesbury before the last ice age about 50,000 years ago , the warwickshire avon was a small river which drained northwards to the river trent the stratford-upon-avon canal links to the avon through a lock in the park in front of the royal shakespeare theatre in stratford-upon-avon the river forms part of the avon ring , a circular cruising route which is long , and includes 129 locks from tewkesbury it follows the course of the river severn , the worcester and birmingham canal and the stratford-upon-avon canal to arrive back at the avon at stratford-upon-avon the navigation works on the avon were originally authorised by an order in council and letters patent of charles i in 1635 , which named william sandys as the grantee , with powers to improve both this river and the river teme he had already bought a number of mills on the river , but there were few objections from millers at those he did not own , for he built pound locks with two sets of gates , to enable vessels to pass by without the large loss of water associated with flash locks the lower avon navigation between evesham and the river severn was leased by george perrott in 1758 , who spent over £4,000 upgrading the locks and weirs to enable 40-ton barges to navigate the river once the stratford canal was completed , there was fierce competition between the upper and lower avon companies , with coal from the worcester and birmingham coming up-river to evesham , and coal coming down-river from stratford because of the sinuous course of the upper river , it was never really considered as a through navigation , except for a brief period when william james thought it could become a through route he bought all of the shares in the upper avon company in 1813 , and persuaded the stratford canal shareholders that there should be a junction between their canal and the river at stratford , which was opened on 24 june 1816 the navigation was taken over by seven men , all connected with the stratford canal , who turned lucy 's lock at stratford into a two-rise staircase lock , constructed three new locks , and improved the river by dredging in 1875 , the gwr decided it would no longer maintain the river , and an appeal to the railway commissioners in 1877 ruled that they were not obliged to do so the worcester and birmingham canal renewed their lease in 1851 for a further 21 years , but traffic was severely hit by the opening of a railway link from ashchurch to evesham in 1864 by 1962 , lant had raised over £50,000 , the 7 locks from tewkesbury to evesham were restored to working order , re-opening the lower avon , and plans were already being made to rebuild evesham town lock and press on towards stratford although the upper avon was in a much worse condition than the lower avon , the upper avon navigation trust ltd ( uant ) was constituted in 1965 to rebuild it

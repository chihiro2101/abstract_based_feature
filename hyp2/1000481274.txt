in the oxford english dictionary , tenné is described as '' orange-brown , as a stain used in blazoning '' , and as a mid-16th-century variant of old french tané as such , in french ( and most of continental ) heraldry , tenné is the light-brownish colour that leather is supposed to have once tanned ( and other combinations may be found in other sources ) though both these sources provide the same hatching of alternating vertical dots and dashes for '' orange '' while tenné is frequently mentioned in books about heraldry , it is not among the basic heraldic colours and its appearance in practice is quite rare arthur charles fox-davies , in his complete guide to heraldry , asserted that both tenné and murrey were probably inventions of the theoretical ( though never shown in actual practice ) system of abatements , further commenting that he knew of only one instance of tenné to date ( as of 1909 ) , and that was in an estate livery rather than coat armory despite its role in the system of theoretical abatement ( heraldry ) introduced in the 16th century , woodcock & robinson , p the oxford guide to heraldry notes that the '' stains '' ( tenné , murrey and sanguine ) '' occur occasionally in the twentieth century but have never been spotted in a visitation record '' fox-davies suggested that orange , as it appears in german heraldry , may be a different colour than tenné , noting that a different hatching is associated with german orange than that of british tenné german heraldic author ottfried neubecker also noted a distinction between orange and brown or tenné , showing the usual hatching for tenné but a distinctive hatching of alternating vertical dots and dashes for orange orangé , tanné and tenné appear in the civic arms of several communes in the department of oise in france it is to be a light brown color , bright enough to be distinguished from the darkest heraldic colour , sable ( black ) , as well as the darker brown color brunâtre , used for bear hide fur svg arms of the french city of maruéjols-lès-gardon , bearing a field tenné file : blason la neuville roy.svg arms of the french commune of la neuville-roy , bearing a field tanné in the dexter chief quarter

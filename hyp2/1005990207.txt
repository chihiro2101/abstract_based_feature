the opposition to the war manifested itself most visibly in a series of worldwide protests against the iraq war during february 2003 , just before the invasion of iraq starting on march 20 , 2003 critics of the invasion claimed that it would lead collateral damage to deaths of thousands of iraqi civilians and soldiers as well as coalition soldiers , and that it would moreover damage peace and stability throughout the region and the world another oft-stated reason for opposition is the westphalian concept that foreign governments should never possess a right to intervene in another sovereign nation 's internal affairs ( including terrorism or any other non-international affair ) giorgio agamben , the italian philosopher , has also offered a critique of the logic of preemptive war others did accept a limited right for military intervention in foreign countries , but nevertheless opposed the invasion on the basis that it was conducted without united nations ' approval and was hence a violation of international law claims that iraq 's secular government had any links to al-qaeda , the islamic fundamentalist terrorist group considered responsible for the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon some expressed puzzlement that the united states would consider military action against iraq and not against north korea , which claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the united states , some argued that the bush administration 's rationale for war was to gain control over iraqi natural resources ( primarily petroleum ) '' no blood for oil '' was a popular protest cry prior to the invasion in march 2003 administration officials denied these charges , and scholar jeff colgan writes that '' there is still no consensus on the degree to which oil played a role '' in the iraq war some opponents of the war also believed that there would be no weapons of mass destruction in iraq , and thus there was little reason for an invasion military intelligence officer and then a united nations weapons inspector in iraq , and who in 1998 had been hawkish enough toward iraq as to be admonished by u.s senator joe biden , '' the decision of whether or not the country should go to war is slightly above your pay grade '' investigations after the invasion failed to produce evidence of wmds in iraq ( apart from a very small number of degraded chemical weapons shells located after the iran–iraq war ended in 1988 ) generally , however , very few opponents of the iraq invasion publicly expressed doubt as to whether the saddam hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction in 2006 for example he opined that when the history of iraq is written the period would '' look like just a comma '' , prompting criticism that he took the more than 2,700 us troop deaths lightly . opposition in the united states the iraq war has met with considerable popular opposition in the united states , beginning during the planning stages and continuing through the invasion subsequent occupation of iraq consistent with the anti-war sentiment of the protests , in the months leading up to the iraq war , american public opinion heavily favored a diplomatic solution over immediate military intervention that poll also found , however , that if diplomacy failed , support for military action to remove saddam hussein was above 60 percent days before the march 20 invasion , a usa today/cnn/gallup poll found support for the war was related to un approval immediately after the 2003 invasion most polls within the united states showed a substantial majority of americans supporting war , but that trend began to shift less than a year after the war began beginning in december 2004 , polls have consistently shown that a majority thinks the invasion was a mistake however , in this area responses vary widely with the exact wording of the question opposition from national security and military personnel on july 28 , 2002 , less than eight months before the invasion of iraq , the washington post reported that '' many senior u.s military officers '' including members of the joint chiefs of staff opposed an invasion on the grounds that the policy of containment was working a few days later , gen morton halperin , a foreign policy expert with the council on foreign relations and center for american progress warned that an invasion would increase the terrorist threat in a 2002 book , scott ritter , a nuclear weapons inspector in iraq from 1991–98 , argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the bush administration 's claims that saddam hussein had a wmd capability he later accused the bush administration of deliberately misleading the public and then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works , and that 's detectable , and they have n't done that there is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability brent scowcroft , who served as national security adviser to president george h.w '' do n't attack saddam '' graham , bradley officers : iraq could drain terror war the washington post , september 1 , 2002 anthony zinni , former head of central command for u.s forces in the middle east and state department 's envoy to the palestinian-israeli

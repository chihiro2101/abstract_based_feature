the opposition to the war manifested itself most visibly in a series of worldwide protests against the iraq war during february 2003 , just before the invasion of iraq starting on march 20 , 2003 critics of the invasion claimed that it would lead collateral damage to deaths of thousands of iraqi civilians and soldiers as well as coalition soldiers , and that it would moreover damage peace and stability throughout the region and the world another oft-stated reason for opposition is the westphalian concept that foreign governments should never possess a right to intervene in another sovereign nation 's internal affairs ( including terrorism or any other non-international affair ) giorgio agamben , the italian philosopher , has also offered a critique of the logic of preemptive war others did accept a limited right for military intervention in foreign countries , but nevertheless opposed the invasion on the basis that it was conducted without united nations ' approval and was hence a violation of international law claims that iraq 's secular government had any links to al-qaeda , the islamic fundamentalist terrorist group considered responsible for the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon some expressed puzzlement that the united states would consider military action against iraq and not against north korea , which claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the united states these critics felt that the war would not help to reduce the threat of wmd proliferation , and that the real reason for the war was to secure control over the iraqi oil fields at a time when us links with saudi arabia were seen to be at risk some opponents of the war also believed that there would be no weapons of mass destruction in iraq , and thus there was little reason for an invasion prominent among these was scott ritter , a former u.s military intelligence officer and then a united nations weapons inspector in iraq , and who in 1998 had been hawkish enough toward iraq as to be admonished by u.s '' investigations after the invasion failed to produce evidence of wmds in iraq ( apart from a very small number of degraded chemical weapons shells located after the iran–iraq war ended in 1988 ) generally , however , very few opponents of the iraq invasion publicly expressed doubt as to whether the saddam hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction during the occupation , some opponents accused president bush of being indifferent to the suffering caused by the invasion . opposition in the united states the iraq war has met with considerable popular opposition in the united states , beginning during the planning stages and continuing through the invasion

who favored immediate military intervention security council were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action , only 54 % of americans favored a u.s beginning in december 2004 , polls

1991–98 , argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the bush administration 's claims that saddam hussein had a wmd capability i think the bush administration has stated that iraq has weapons of mass destruction , and that 's as simple as they want to keep it and then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works , and that 's detectable , and they have n't done that there is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability he wrote an august 15 , 2002 editorial in the wall

the opposition to the war manifested itself most visibly in a series of worldwide protests against the iraq war during february 2003 , just before the invasion of iraq starting on march 20 , 2003 critics of the invasion claimed that it would lead collateral damage to deaths of thousands of iraqi civilians and soldiers as well as coalition soldiers , and that it would moreover damage peace and stability throughout the region and the world another oft-stated reason for opposition is the westphalian concept that foreign governments should never possess a right to intervene in another sovereign nation 's internal affairs ( including terrorism or any other non-international affair ) giorgio agamben , the italian philosopher , has also offered a critique of the logic of preemptive war others did accept a limited right for military intervention in foreign countries , but nevertheless opposed the invasion on the basis that it was conducted without united nations ' approval and was hence a violation of international law claims that iraq 's secular government had any links to al-qaeda , the islamic fundamentalist terrorist group considered responsible for the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the world trade center and pentagon some expressed puzzlement that the united states would consider military action against iraq and not against north korea , which claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the united states , some argued that the bush administration 's rationale for war was to gain control over iraqi natural resources ( primarily petroleum ) these critics felt that the war would not help to reduce the threat of wmd proliferation , and that the real reason for the war was to secure control over the iraqi oil fields at a time when us links with saudi arabia were seen to be at risk administration officials denied these charges , and scholar jeff colgan writes that '' there is still no consensus on the degree to which oil played a role '' in the iraq war some opponents of the war also believed that there would be no weapons of mass destruction in iraq , and thus there was little reason for an invasion senator joe biden , '' the decision of whether or not the country should go to war is slightly above your pay grade '' investigations after the invasion failed to produce evidence of wmds in iraq ( apart from a very small number of degraded chemical weapons shells located after the iran–iraq war ended in 1988 ) in 2006 for example he opined that when the history of iraq is written the period would '' look like just a comma '' , prompting criticism that he took the more than 2,700 us troop deaths lightly the iraq war has met with considerable popular opposition in the united states

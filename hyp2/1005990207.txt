the opposition to the war manifested itself most visibly in a series of worldwide protests against the iraq war during february 2003 , just before the invasion of iraq starting on march 20 , 2003 critics of the invasion claimed that it would lead collateral damage to deaths of thousands of iraqi civilians and soldiers as well as coalition soldiers , and that it would moreover damage peace and stability throughout the region and the world another oft-stated reason for opposition is the westphalian concept that foreign governments should never possess a right to intervene in another sovereign nation 's internal affairs ( including terrorism or any other non-international affair ) others did accept a limited right for military intervention in foreign countries , but nevertheless opposed the invasion on the basis that it was conducted without united nations ' approval and was hence a violation of international law some expressed puzzlement that the united states would consider military action against iraq and not against north korea , which claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the united states , some argued that the bush administration 's rationale for war was to gain control over iraqi natural resources ( primarily petroleum ) these critics felt that the war would not help to reduce the threat of wmd proliferation , and that the real reason for the war was to secure control over the iraqi oil fields at a time when us links with saudi arabia were seen to be at risk administration officials denied these charges , and scholar jeff colgan writes that '' there is still no consensus on the degree to which oil played a role '' in the iraq war some opponents of the war also believed that there would be no weapons of mass destruction in iraq , and thus there was little reason for an invasion military intelligence officer and then a united nations weapons inspector in iraq , and who in 1998 had been hawkish enough toward iraq as to be admonished by u.s senator joe biden , '' the decision of whether or not the country should go to war is slightly above your pay grade '' investigations after the invasion failed to produce evidence of wmds in iraq ( apart from a very small number of degraded chemical weapons shells located after the iran–iraq war ended in 1988 ) generally , however , very few opponents of the iraq invasion publicly expressed doubt as to whether the saddam hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction during the occupation , some opponents accused president bush of being indifferent to the suffering caused by the invasion in 2006 for example he opined that when the history of iraq is written the period would '' look like just a comma '' , prompting criticism that he took the more than 2,700 us troop deaths lightly . opposition in the united states the iraq war has met with considerable popular opposition in the united states , beginning during the planning stages and continuing through the invasion subsequent occupation of iraq the months leading up to the war saw protests across the united states , the largest of which , held on february 15 , 2003 involved about 300,000 to 400,000 protesters in new york city , with smaller numbers protesting in seattle , san francisco , chicago , and other cities a january 2003 cbs news/new york times poll found that 63 % of americans wanted president bush to find a diplomatic solution to the iraq situation , compared with 31 % who favored immediate military intervention that poll also found , however , that if diplomacy failed , support for military action to remove saddam hussein was above 60 percent days before the march 20 invasion , a usa today/cnn/gallup poll found support for the war was related to un approval security council were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action , only 54 % of americans favored a u.s beginning in december 2004 , polls have consistently shown that a majority thinks the invasion was a mistake should do in iraq is split , with a slight majority generally favoring setting a timetable for withdrawal , but against withdrawing immediately

national security and military personnel on july 28 , 2002 , less than eight months before the invasion of iraq , the washington post reported that '' many senior u.s military officers '' including

argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the bush administration 's claims that saddam hussein had a wmd capability there is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of

october 2 , 2002 : '' i am not opposed to all wars dodd voted in favor of the iraq resolution in 2002 , but dodd has since become an opponent of the war bush because the iraq war had been begun by the

research has shown that perception of the müller-lyer illusion can vary rivers noted that indigenous people of the australian murray island were less susceptible to the müller-lyer illusion than were europeans for the müller-lyer illusion , the mean fractional misperception of the length of the line segments varied from 1.4 % to 20.3 % in their definitive paper of 1966 , they investigated seventeen cultures and showed that people in different cultures differ substantially on how they experience the müller-lyer stimuli '' they also used the word '' carpentered '' for the environments that europeans mostly live in - characterized by straight lines , right angles , and square corners here , no significant difference in susceptibility to the m-l illusion was found it is believed now that not '' carpenteredness '' , but the density of pigmentation in the eye is related to susceptibility to the m-l illusion the subjects from urban areas were shown to be considerably more susceptible to the illusion , as were younger subjects experiments have been reported suggesting that pigeons perceive the standard müller-lyer illusion , but not the reversed in the müller-lyer illusion , the visual system would in this explanation detect the depth cues , which are usually associated with 3d scenes , and incorrectly decide it is a 3d drawing , suggest that the visual procedure of centroid extraction is causally related to a spatial pooling of the positional signals evoked by the neighboring object parts sarcone visual explanation of the color spreading effect in the müller-lyer illusion the müller-lyer illusion explained by the statistics of image–source relationships the misplaced illusion ? the case of the mueller-lyer perceptual incongruity figure nakamura noriyuki ( müller-lyer illusion in pigeons ) the muller-lyer illusion explained by rochester institute of technology

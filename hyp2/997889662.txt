research has shown that perception of the müller-lyer illusion can vary rivers noted that indigenous people of the australian murray island were less susceptible to the müller-lyer illusion than were europeans rivers 1901 : the measurement of visual illusion rep in 1963 , segall , campbell and herskovitz compared susceptibility to four different visual illusions in three population samples of caucasians , twelve of africans , and one from the philippines for the müller-lyer illusion , the mean fractional misperception of the length of the line segments varied from 1.4 % to 20.3 % subsequent work by jahoda suggested that retinal pigmentation may have a role in the differing perceptions on this illusion , and this was verified later by pollack ( 1970 ) it is believed now that not '' carpenteredness '' , but the density of pigmentation in the eye is related to susceptibility to the m-l illusion the subjects from urban areas were shown to be considerably more susceptible to the illusion , as were younger subjects however , in a recent report the müller-lyer illusion explained by the statistics of image–source relationships catherine q , an explanation based on past experience with the sources of such stimuli ) , convex and concave corners contribute little if anything to the müller-lyer effect concerning the müller-lyer and similar illusions , the pattern of neural excitation evoked by contextual flank ( e.g müller-lyer illusion dynamic müller-lyer illusion by gianni a sarcone visual explanation of the color spreading effect in the müller-lyer illusion the müller-lyer illusion explained by the statistics of image–source relationships the misplaced illusion ? the case of the mueller-lyer perceptual incongruity figure

research has shown that perception of the müller-lyer illusion can vary rivers noted that indigenous people of the australian murray island were less susceptible to the müller-lyer illusion than were europeans 818 rivers suggested that this difference may be because europeans live in more rectilinear environments than the islanders for the müller-lyer illusion , the mean fractional misperception of the length of the line segments varied from 1.4 % to 20.3 % they wrote that '' european and american city dwellers have a much higher percentage of rectangularity in their environments than non-europeans and so are more susceptible to that illusion subsequent work by jahoda suggested that retinal pigmentation may have a role in the differing perceptions on this illusion , and this was verified later by pollack ( 1970 ) it is believed now that not '' carpenteredness '' , but the density of pigmentation in the eye is related to susceptibility to the m-l illusion an intra-cultural investigation of susceptibility to '' perspective '' and '' non-perspective '' spatial illusions , br experiments have been reported suggesting that pigeons perceive the standard müller-lyer illusion , but not the reversed in the müller-lyer illusion , the visual system would in this explanation detect the depth cues , which are usually associated with 3d scenes , and incorrectly decide it is a 3d drawing the width of the rug should obviously be considered shorter than the length of the wall in the back concerning the müller-lyer and similar illusions , the pattern of neural excitation evoked by contextual flank ( e.g müller-lyer illusion dynamic müller-lyer illusion by gianni a

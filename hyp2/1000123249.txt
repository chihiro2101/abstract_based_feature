if symptoms do appear , they usually take 4–6 weeks from the time of infection the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise within 12 hours of infection , an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash , commonly referred to as '' swimmer 's itch '' , due to irritation at the point of entrance the rash that may develop can mimic scabies and other types of rashes other symptoms can occur 2–10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed , acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants a similar , more severe reaction called '' swimmer 's itch '' reaction can also be caused by cercariae from animal trematodes that often infect birds symptoms include fever , lethargy , the eruption of pale temporary bumps associated with severe itching ( urticarial ) rash , liver and spleen enlargement , and bronchospasm acute schistosomiasis ( katayama fever ) may occur weeks or months after the initial infection as a systemic reaction against migrating schistosomulae as they pass through the bloodstream through the lungs to the liver similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists the eggs secrete proteolysis enzymes that help them migrate to the bladder and intestines to be shed the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain the long-term manifestations are dependent on the species of schistosome , as the adult worms of different species migrate to different areas the risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers , perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it to be exposed to carcinogens from smoking in women , genitourinary disease can also include genital lesions that may lead to increased rates of hiv transmission eggs in the gut wall can lead to pain , hematochezia , and diarrhea ( especially in children ) eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection mansoni infection epidemiologically overlaps with high hiv prevalence in sub-saharan africa , where gastrointestinal schistosomiasis has been linked to increased hiv transmission in situ egg deposition following the anomalous migration of the adult worm appears to be the only mechanism by which schistosoma can reach the central nervous system in these patients in cases with advanced hepatosplenic and urinary schistosomiasis , the continuous embolization of eggs from the portal mesenteric system ( s once this step has been completed , the parasite leaves the snail and enters the water column for several weeks , the worm remains in the vessels , continuing its development into its adult phase while transmission typically occurs only in countries where the freshwater snails are endemic , a case in germany was reported where a man got schistosoma by an infected snail in his aquarium eggs can be present in the stool in infections with all schistosoma species because eggs may be passed intermittently or in small numbers , their detection is enhanced by repeated examinations or concentration procedures , or both identification of microhematuria in urine using urine reagent strips is more accurate than circulating antigen tests in the identification of active schistosomiasis in endemic areas antibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs can not be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens immunoblots with adult worm microsomal antigens are species-specific , so a positive reaction indicates the infecting species the drug praziquantel is used for prevention in high-risk populations living in areas where the disease is common because of praziquantel 's lower cost per treatment , and oxaminiquine 's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by s the disease is found in tropics countries in africa , the caribbean , eastern south america , southeast asia , and the middle east in 2016 more than 200 million people needed treatment but only 88 million people were actually treated for schistosomiasis schistosomiasis is endemic in egypt , exacerbated by the country 's dam and irrigation projects along the nile

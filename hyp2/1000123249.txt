the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise other symptoms can occur 2–10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms the rash can occur between the first few hours and a week after exposure and lasts for several days another primary condition , called katayama fever , may also develop from infection with these worms , and it can be very difficult to recognize acute schistosomiasis ( katayama fever ) may occur weeks or months after the initial infection as a systemic reaction against migrating schistosomulae as they pass through the bloodstream through the lungs to the liver similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists in long-established disease , adult worms lay eggs that can cause inflammation reactions the eggs secrete proteolysis enzymes that help them migrate to the bladder and intestines to be shed the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain the long-term manifestations are dependent on the species of schistosome , as the adult worms of different species migrate to different areas many infections are mildly symptomatic , with anemia and malnutrition being common in endemic areas in women , genitourinary disease can also include genital lesions that may lead to increased rates of hiv transmission eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection mansoni infection epidemiologically overlaps with high hiv prevalence in sub-saharan africa , where gastrointestinal schistosomiasis has been linked to increased hiv transmission central nervous system lesions occur occasionally japonicum have rates of seizures eight times higher than baseline cerebral granulomatous infection may also be caused by s in cases with advanced hepatosplenic and urinary schistosomiasis , the continuous embolization of eggs from the portal mesenteric system ( s infected individuals release schistosoma eggs into water via their fecal material or urine after larvae hatch from these eggs , the larvae infect a very specific type of freshwater snail the schistosoma larvae undergo the next phase of their lifecycles in these snails , spending their time reproducing and developing the parasite can live in the water for only 48 hours without a mammalian host diagnosis of infection is confirmed by the identification of eggs in stools stool examination should be performed when infection with s quantification is possible by using filtration through a nucleopore filter membrane of a standard volume of urine followed by egg counts on the membrane haematobium ) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative immunoblots with adult worm microsomal antigens are species-specific , so a positive reaction indicates the infecting species because of praziquantel 's lower cost per treatment , and oxaminiquine 's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by s all cases of suspected schistosomiasis should be treated regardless of presentation because the adult parasite can live in the host for years in many of the affected areas , schistosomiasis infects a large proportion of children under 14 years of age an estimated 600 to 700 million people worldwide are at risk from the disease because they live in countries where the organism is common the first physician who described the entire disease cycle was the brazilian parasitologist pirajá da silva in 1908 using crispr gene editing , researchers decreased the symptoms due to schistosomiasis in an animal model .

if symptoms do appear , they usually take 4–6 weeks from the time of infection the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise the rash that may develop can mimic scabies and other types of rashes other symptoms can occur 2–10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma this immune response can lead to obstruction of the colon and blood loss the infected individual may have what appears to be a potbelly individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms the first potential reaction is an itchy , papule rash that results from cercariae penetrating the skin , often in a person 's first infection because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed , acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants another primary condition , called katayama fever , may also develop from infection with these worms , and it can be very difficult to recognize similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists in long-established disease , adult worms lay eggs that can cause inflammation reactions many infections are mildly symptomatic , with anemia and malnutrition being common in endemic areas in women , genitourinary disease can also include genital lesions that may lead to increased rates of hiv transmission eggs in the gut wall can lead to pain , hematochezia , and diarrhea ( especially in children ) severe disease can lead to narrowing of the colon or rectum eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection mansoni infection epidemiologically overlaps with high hiv prevalence in sub-saharan africa , where gastrointestinal schistosomiasis has been linked to increased hiv transmission . central nervous system disease cerebral granulomatous disease may be caused by s cerebral granulomatous infection may also be caused by s in cases with advanced hepatosplenic and urinary schistosomiasis , the continuous embolization of eggs from the portal mesenteric system ( s infected individuals release schistosoma eggs into water via their fecal material or urine after larvae hatch from these eggs , the larvae infect a very specific type of freshwater snail intercalatum it is snails of the genus bulinus , in s eggs enter the bladder/intestine and are excreted through urine and feces and the process repeats while transmission typically occurs only in countries where the freshwater snails are endemic , a case in germany was reported where a man got schistosoma by an infected snail in his aquarium haematobium ( recommended time for collection : between noon and 3 pm ) and with s haematobium ) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative antibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs can not be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens many countries are working towards eradicating the disease the treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease mansoni is found in parts of south america and the caribbean , africa , and the middle east ; s in 2016 more than 200 million people needed treatment but only 88 million people were actually treated for schistosomiasis

if symptoms do appear , they usually take 4–6 weeks from the time of infection the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise within 12 hours of infection , an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash , commonly referred to as '' swimmer 's itch '' , due to irritation at the point of entrance other symptoms can occur 2–10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body if eggs migrate to the brain or spinal cord , seizures , paralysis , or spinal-cord inflammation are possible in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms the first potential reaction is an itchy , papule rash that results from cercariae penetrating the skin , often in a person 's first infection because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed , acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants a similar , more severe reaction called '' swimmer 's itch '' reaction can also be caused by cercariae from animal trematodes that often infect birds symptoms include fever , lethargy , the eruption of pale temporary bumps associated with severe itching ( urticarial ) rash , liver and spleen enlargement , and bronchospasm similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists in long-established disease , adult worms lay eggs that can cause inflammation reactions the eggs secrete proteolysis enzymes that help them migrate to the bladder and intestines to be shed the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain the long-term manifestations are dependent on the species of schistosome , as the adult worms of different species migrate to different areas this can lead to hematuria 10 to 12 weeks after infection in women , genitourinary disease can also include genital lesions that may lead to increased rates of hiv transmission eggs in the gut wall can lead to pain , hematochezia , and diarrhea ( especially in children ) severe disease can lead to narrowing of the colon or rectum eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection mansoni infection epidemiologically overlaps with high hiv prevalence in sub-saharan africa , where gastrointestinal schistosomiasis has been linked to increased hiv transmission . central nervous system disease cerebral granulomatous disease may be caused by s in situ egg deposition following the anomalous migration of the adult worm appears to be the only mechanism by which schistosoma can reach the central nervous system in these patients in cases with advanced hepatosplenic and urinary schistosomiasis , the continuous embolization of eggs from the portal mesenteric system ( s for several weeks , the worm remains in the vessels , continuing its development into its adult phase humans encounter larvae of the schistosoma parasite when they enter contaminated water while bathing , playing , swimming , washing , fishing , or walking through the water haematobium ) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative using a microscope to detect eggs costs about us 0.40 per test whereas pcr is about us 7 per test as of 2019 the drug praziquantel is used for prevention in high-risk populations living in areas where the disease is common the treatment objective is to cure the disease and to prevent the evolution of the acute to the chronic form of the disease the disease is found in tropics countries in africa , the caribbean , eastern south america , southeast asia , and the middle east an estimated 600 to 700 million people worldwide are at risk from the disease because they live in countries where the organism is common in 2016 more than 200 million people needed treatment but only 88 million people were actually treated for schistosomiasis

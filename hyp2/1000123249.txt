if symptoms do appear , they usually take 4–6 weeks from the time of infection the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise within 12 hours of infection , an individual may complain of a tingling sensation or light rash , commonly referred to as '' swimmer 's itch '' , due to irritation at the point of entrance other symptoms can occur 2–10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body if eggs migrate to the brain or spinal cord , seizures , paralysis , or spinal-cord inflammation are possible in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma the infected individual may have what appears to be a potbelly in rare instances , the central nervous system is affected the first potential reaction is an itchy , papule rash that results from cercariae penetrating the skin , often in a person 's first infection because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed , acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants acute schistosomiasis ( katayama fever ) may occur weeks or months after the initial infection as a systemic reaction against migrating schistosomulae as they pass through the bloodstream through the lungs to the liver similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists in long-established disease , adult worms lay eggs that can cause inflammation reactions the eggs secrete proteolysis enzymes that help them migrate to the bladder and intestines to be shed the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain haematobium migrate to the veins around the bladder and ureters in women , genitourinary disease can also include genital lesions that may lead to increased rates of hiv transmission severe disease can lead to narrowing of the colon or rectum eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection haematobium eggs in the spinal cord can lead to transverse myelitis with flaccid paraplegia infected individuals release schistosoma eggs into water via their fecal material or urine the schistosoma larvae undergo the next phase of their lifecycles in these snails , spending their time reproducing and developing for several weeks , the worm remains in the vessels , continuing its development into its adult phase humans encounter larvae of the schistosoma parasite when they enter contaminated water while bathing , playing , swimming , washing , fishing , or walking through the water other methods that can be used are elisa , circumoval precipitation test , and alkaline phosphatase immunoassay microscopic identification of eggs in feces or urine is the most practical method for diagnosis stool examination should be performed when infection with s because eggs may be passed intermittently or in small numbers , their detection is enhanced by repeated examinations or concentration procedures , or both haematobium ) may demonstrate eggs when stool or urine examinations are negative antibody detection can be useful to indicate schistosome infection in people who have traveled to areas where schistosomiasis is common and in whom eggs can not be demonstrated in fecal or urine specimens centers for disease control and prevention , a combination of tests with purified adult worm antigens is used for antibody detection further , at the 1986 diama dam on the senegal river , restoring prawns upstream of the dam reduced both snail density and the human schistosomiasis reinfection rate a cochrane review found tentative evidence that when used alone , metrifonate was as effective as praziquantel haematobium , the infectious agent responsible for urogenital schistosomiasis , infects over 112 million people annually in sub-saharan africa alone in 2016 more than 200 million people needed treatment but only 88 million people were actually treated for schistosomiasis

if symptoms do appear , they usually take 4–6 weeks from the time of infection the first symptom of the disease may be a general malaise the rash that may develop can mimic scabies and other types of rashes other symptoms can occur 2–10 weeks later and can include fever , aching , a cough , diarrhea , chills , or gland enlargement these symptoms can also be related to avian schistosomiasis , which does not cause any further symptoms in humans the manifestations of schistosomal infection vary over time as the cercariae , and later adult worms and their eggs , migrate through the body in intestinal schistosomiasis , eggs become lodged in the intestinal wall and cause an immune system reaction called a granuloma the infected individual may have what appears to be a potbelly in rare instances , the central nervous system is affected individuals with chronic active schistosomiasis may not complain of typical symptoms because people living in affected areas have often been repeatedly exposed , acute reactions are more common in tourists and migrants another primary condition , called katayama fever , may also develop from infection with these worms , and it can be very difficult to recognize similarly to swimmer 's itch , katayama fever is more commonly seen in people with their first infection such as migrants and tourists in long-established disease , adult worms lay eggs that can cause inflammation reactions the enzymes also cause an eosinophilic inflammatory reaction when eggs get trapped in tissues or embolize to the liver , spleen , lungs , or brain many infections are mildly symptomatic , with anemia and malnutrition being common in endemic areas over time , fibrosis can lead to obstruction of the urinary tract , hydronephrosis , and renal failure the risk of bladder cancer appears to be especially high in male smokers , perhaps due to chronic irritation of the bladder lining allowing it to be exposed to carcinogens from smoking eggs in the gut wall can lead to pain , hematochezia , and diarrhea ( especially in children ) severe disease can lead to narrowing of the colon or rectum eggs also migrate to the liver leading to fibrosis in 4 to 8 % of people with chronic infection , mainly those with long-term heavy infection mansoni infection epidemiologically overlaps with high hiv prevalence in sub-saharan africa , where gastrointestinal schistosomiasis has been linked to increased hiv transmission . central nervous system disease cerebral granulomatous disease may be caused by s in situ egg deposition following the anomalous migration of the adult worm appears to be the only mechanism by which schistosoma can reach the central nervous system in these patients after larvae hatch from these eggs , the larvae infect a very specific type of freshwater snail the schistosoma larvae undergo the next phase of their lifecycles in these snails , spending their time reproducing and developing once this step has been completed , the parasite leaves the snail and enters the water column for several weeks , the worm remains in the vessels , continuing its development into its adult phase when maturity is reached , mating occurs and eggs are produced if the eggs do not get excreted , they can become engrained in the body tissues and cause a variety of problems such as immune reactions and organ damage diagnosis of infection is confirmed by the identification of eggs in stools however , it is not frequently used in countries where the disease is common due to the cost of the equipment and the technical expertise required to run the tests the centers for disease control and prevention advises avoiding drinking or coming into contact with contaminated water in areas where schistosomiasis is common because of praziquantel 's lower cost per treatment , and oxaminiquine 's lack of efficacy against the urogenital form of the disease caused by s in 2010 , approximately 238 & nbsp ; million people were infected with schistosomiasis , 85 percent of whom live in africa in 2016 more than 200 million people needed treatment but only 88 million people were actually treated for schistosomiasis

kofun ( from middle chinese kú 古 '' ancient '' + bjun 墳 '' burial mound '' ) are burial mounds built for members of the ruling class from the 3rd to the 7th centuries in japan , and the kofun period takes its name from the distinctive earthen mounds kofun have four basic shapes : round and square are the most common , followed by 'scallop-shell ' and 'keyhole kofun range in size from several meters to over 400 meters long , and unglazed pottery figures ( haniwa ) were often buried under a kofun 's circumference the oldest japanese kofun is reportedly hokenoyama kofun in sakurai , nara , which dates to the late 3rd century the keyhole kofun spread from yamato to kawachi—with giant kofun , such as daisenryō kofun—and then throughout the country during the 5th century keyhole kofun disappeared later in the 6th century , probably because of the drastic reformation of the yamato court ; nihon shoki records the introduction of buddhism at this time yamato rule is usually believed to have begun about 250 ad , and it is generally agreed that yamato rulers had keyhole-kofun culture and hegemony in yamato until the 4th century according to the book of song , yamato relationships with china probably began in the late 4th century the yamato polity , which emerged by the late 5th century , was distinguished by powerful clans ( 豪族 , gōzoku ) the kofun period is called the yamato period by some western scholars , since this local chieftainship became the imperial dynasty at the end of the period however , the yamato clan ruled just one polity among others during the kofun era japanese archaeologists emphasise that other regional chieftainships ( such as kibi ) were in close contention for dominance in the first half of the kofun period ; kibi 's tsukuriyama kofun is japan 's fourth-largest the yamato name became synonymous with japan as yamato rulers suppressed other clans and acquired agricultural land according to the legend , there was an eastern land in honshū '' whose people disobeyed the imperial court '' and against whom yamato takeru was sent to fight although the legend is probably not factual , aizu is near southern tōhoku ( the northern extent of late-4th-century keyhole-kofun culture ) the period was a critical stage in japan 's evolution into a cohesive , recognized state while the rulers ' title was officially '' king '' , they called themselves '' ōkimi '' ( 大王 , '' great king '' ) during this period kanamura resigned due to the failure of his diplomatic policies , and the court was controlled by the mononobe and soga clans at the beginning of the asuka period they introduced numerous , significant aspects of chinese culture to japan although writing was largely unknown to the indigenous japanese of the period , the literary skills of foreigners seem to have been increasingly appreciated by the japanese elite the introduction of buddhism in 538 marked the transition from the kofun to the asuka period , which coincided with the reunification of china under the sui dynasty later in the century korean history record samguk sagi : 三國史記 百済本紀 : 六年夏五月 王與倭國結好 以太子腆支爲質 秋七月大閱於漢水之南 hogong , from japan , helped to found silla japan this period is part of the yamato period of history of japan .

deliberately to use one 's imagination or employ strategies to bring about effects ( even if interpreted , eventually , as involuntary ) in response to a communication or expectation to conform overtly to expectations or the views of others , without the appropriate private acceptance or experience ; that is , to exhibit behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief self-report measures of suggestibility became available in 2004 , and they made it possible to isolate and study the global trait a teacher could trick his ap psych students by saying , '' suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation , right ? '' it 's likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he 's a teacher and what he said sounds correct however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories hypnotic suggestibility is a trait-like , individual difference variable reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions research with standardized measures of hypnotic suggestibility has demonstrated that there are substantial individual differences in this variable the extent to which a subject may or may not be '' suggestible '' has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena most hypnotherapists and academics in this field of research work from the premise that hypnotic susceptibility ( or suggestibility ) is a factor in inducing useful hypnosis states thus the emotional suggestible learns more by inference than by direct , literal suggestions physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says with this type of subject the operator must give logical explanations for every suggestion and must allow the subject to feel that he is doing the hypnotizing himself conceptually , hypnotizability has always been defined as the increase in suggestibility produced by hypnosis although the induction of hypnosis increases suggestibility to a substantial degree , the correlation between hypnotic and non-hypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales this indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability the intrigue of differences in individual suggestibility even crops up in the early greek philosophers it is perhaps the '' necessarily believing it '' that is problematic , as this conception of suggestibility raises issues of the autonomy of attributing belief to an introduced idea , and how this happens popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another the two terms are not synonymous , however , as the latter term carries inherent negative bias absent from the neutral psychological factor described by '' suggestibility '' in scientific research and academic literature on hypnosis and hypnotherapy , the term '' suggestibility '' describes a neutral psychological and possibly physiological state or phenomena it therefore has a negative effect on expectation and itself is a hypnotic suggestion that suggestions must be noticed and guarded against this predisposes children towards higher levels of suggestibility , and as such children are an important area of suggestibility investigation prior knowledge , as it relates to suggestibility is the use of past experiences to help reconstruct past or current events when an interviewer 's tone dictates the questioning , a child is likely to construct memories of past events when they actually have no memory of that event studies of effects of health interventions can be enhanced by controlling for individual differences in suggestibility

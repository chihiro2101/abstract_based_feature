attempts to isolate a global trait of '' suggestibility '' have not been successful , due to an inability of the available testing procedures to distinguish measurable differences between the following distinct types of '' suggestibility '' : to be affected by a communication or expectation such that certain responses are overtly enacted , or subjectively experienced , without volition , as in automatism to conform overtly to expectations or the views of others , without the appropriate private acceptance or experience ; that is , to exhibit behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief wagstaff 's view is that , because '' a true response to a hypnotic suggestion is not a response brought about at any stage by volition , but rather a true non-volitional response , and perhaps even brought about despite volition '' , the first category really embodies the true domain of hypnotic suggestibility suggestibility can be seen in people 's day-to-day lives : someone witnesses an argument after school when later asked about the '' huge fight '' that occurred , he recalls the memory , but unknowingly distorts it with exaggerated fabrications , because he now thinks of the event as a '' huge fight '' instead of a simple argument a teacher could trick his ap psych students by saying , '' suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation , right ? '' it 's likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he 's a teacher and what he said sounds correct however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories hypnotic suggestibility is a trait-like , individual difference variable reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions research with standardized measures of hypnotic suggestibility has demonstrated that there are substantial individual differences in this variable the extent to which a subject may or may not be '' suggestible '' has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena most hypnotherapists and academics in this field of research work from the premise that hypnotic susceptibility ( or suggestibility ) is a factor in inducing useful hypnosis states physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says although the induction of hypnosis increases suggestibility to a substantial degree , the correlation between hypnotic and non-hypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales this indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability existing research into the phenomena of hypnosis is extensive and randomized controlled trials predominantly support the efficacy and legitimacy of hypnotherapy , but without a clearly defined concept of the entity or aspect being studied , the level an individual is objectively '' suggestible '' can not be measured empirically popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another the two terms are not synonymous , however , as the latter term carries inherent negative bias absent from the neutral psychological factor described by '' suggestibility '' in scientific research and academic literature on hypnosis and hypnotherapy , the term '' suggestibility '' describes a neutral psychological and possibly physiological state or phenomena simple one-word forms of this include the word terrorism where to understand the concept , one must understand the notion of terror and then understand in the sentence that it is meant to refer to '' that '' given object either they are suggested from the mind itself , or in response to introduced suggestions of concepts from outside – the world and its scenarios and facts , or suggestions from other people when an interviewer 's tone dictates the questioning , a child is likely to construct memories of past events when they actually have no memory of that event it has been shown to have a great effect on the accuracy of a child 's recollection of an event , and eventually , the misinformation will be included in the child 's account of a given event little research has been carried out into the effects of anxious mood at the time of either the encoding of misleading post‐event information or the time of its possible retrieval , on subsequent suggestibility children 's memory and suggestibility were assessed for a medical examination and venipuncture while it is true that did sufferers tend to score to the higher end of the hypnotizability scale , there have not been enough studies done to support the claim of increased suggestibility

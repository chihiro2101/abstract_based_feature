deliberately to use one 's imagination or employ strategies to bring about effects ( even if interpreted , eventually , as involuntary ) in response to a communication or expectation to accept what people say consciously , but uncritically , and to believe or privately accept what is said to conform overtly to expectations or the views of others , without the appropriate private acceptance or experience ; that is , to exhibit behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief self-report measures of suggestibility became available in 2004 , and they made it possible to isolate and study the global trait suggestibility can be seen in people 's day-to-day lives : someone witnesses an argument after school when later asked about the '' huge fight '' that occurred , he recalls the memory , but unknowingly distorts it with exaggerated fabrications , because he now thinks of the event as a '' huge fight '' instead of a simple argument however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories hypnotic suggestibility is a trait-like , individual difference variable reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions research with standardized measures of hypnotic suggestibility has demonstrated that there are substantial individual differences in this variable the extent to which a subject may or may not be '' suggestible '' has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena that is , the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs , expectations and instructions physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says with this type of subject the operator must give logical explanations for every suggestion and must allow the subject to feel that he is doing the hypnotizing himself although the induction of hypnosis increases suggestibility to a substantial degree , the correlation between hypnotic and non-hypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales this indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability the intrigue of differences in individual suggestibility even crops up in the early greek philosophers popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another the term '' susceptible '' implies weakness or some increased danger that one is more likely to become victim to and must guard against cognition of a phrase must occur before the decision how to act next can occur : because the concepts must exist before the mind either they are suggested from the mind itself , or in response to introduced suggestions of concepts from outside – the world and its scenarios and facts , or suggestions from other people a hypnotist uses techniques that use these instinctive '' fillings-in of gaps '' and changes to how we respond to a scenario or moment the problem as it relates to suggestibility is when children , and even adults , blend previous knowledge of similar experiences into their recollection of a single event it has been shown to have a great effect on the accuracy of a child 's recollection of an event , and eventually , the misinformation will be included in the child 's account of a given event children 's memory and suggestibility were assessed for a medical examination and venipuncture the gudjonsson suggestibility scale is questionable for this kind of purpose due to its narrow focus

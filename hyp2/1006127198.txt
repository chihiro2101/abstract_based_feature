attempts to isolate a global trait of '' suggestibility '' have not been successful , due to an inability of the available testing procedures to distinguish measurable differences between the following distinct types of '' suggestibility '' : to be affected by a communication or expectation such that certain responses are overtly enacted , or subjectively experienced , without volition , as in automatism to conform overtly to expectations or the views of others , without the appropriate private acceptance or experience ; that is , to exhibit behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief wagstaff 's view is that , because '' a true response to a hypnotic suggestion is not a response brought about at any stage by volition , but rather a true non-volitional response , and perhaps even brought about despite volition '' , the first category really embodies the true domain of hypnotic suggestibility when later asked about the '' huge fight '' that occurred , he recalls the memory , but unknowingly distorts it with exaggerated fabrications , because he now thinks of the event as a '' huge fight '' instead of a simple argument a teacher could trick his ap psych students by saying , '' suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation , right ? '' it 's likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he 's a teacher and what he said sounds correct however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories this suggestion caused the young girl to fabricate memories of her father molesting her , which led to her being placed in foster care and her father being tried on charges of abuse hypnotic suggestibility is a trait-like , individual difference variable reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions the extent to which a subject may or may not be '' suggestible '' has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena most hypnotherapists and academics in this field of research work from the premise that hypnotic susceptibility ( or suggestibility ) is a factor in inducing useful hypnosis states that is , the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs , expectations and instructions physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says although the induction of hypnosis increases suggestibility to a substantial degree , the correlation between hypnotic and non-hypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales existing research into the phenomena of hypnosis is extensive and randomized controlled trials predominantly support the efficacy and legitimacy of hypnotherapy , but without a clearly defined concept of the entity or aspect being studied , the level an individual is objectively '' suggestible '' can not be measured empirically on this latter point , it must be pointed out that while some persuasion methods are more universally effective than others , the most reliably effective method with individuals is to personalize the approach by first examining their motivational , learning , behavioral and emotional styles ( et al popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another the two terms are not synonymous , however , as the latter term carries inherent negative bias absent from the neutral psychological factor described by '' suggestibility '' in scientific research and academic literature on hypnosis and hypnotherapy , the term '' suggestibility '' describes a neutral psychological and possibly physiological state or phenomena in the individual , unexamined actions are sometimes described by hypno- and psycho-therapists based on outgrown belief systems the term '' susceptible '' implies weakness or some increased danger that one is more likely to become victim to and must guard against it therefore has a negative effect on expectation and itself is a hypnotic suggestion that suggestions must be noticed and guarded against hypnotic suggestions include terms , phrases , or whole concepts where to understand the concept includes making sense of a subjective sensation , or a framework for the appropriate response gist extraction : although children are extremely likely to recall false memory when past events are similar to a current event , they will also recall false memory details that are seemingly unrelated to the event while it is true that did sufferers tend to score to the higher end of the hypnotizability scale , there have not been enough studies done to support the claim of increased suggestibility placebo response is also thought to be based on individual differences in suggestibility , at least in part

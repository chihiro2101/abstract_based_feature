deliberately to use one 's imagination or employ strategies to bring about effects ( even if interpreted , eventually , as involuntary ) in response to a communication or expectation suggestibility can be seen in people 's day-to-day lives : someone witnesses an argument after school a teacher could trick his ap psych students by saying , '' suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation , right ? '' it 's likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he 's a teacher and what he said sounds correct however , suggestibility can also be seen in extremes , resulting in negative consequences : a witness ' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview , which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories this suggestion caused the young girl to fabricate memories of her father molesting her , which led to her being placed in foster care and her father being tried on charges of abuse hypnotic suggestibility is a trait-like , individual difference variable reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions research with standardized measures of hypnotic suggestibility has demonstrated that there are substantial individual differences in this variable the extent to which a subject may or may not be '' suggestible '' has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena that is , the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs , expectations and instructions intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says with this type of subject the operator must give logical explanations for every suggestion and must allow the subject to feel that he is doing the hypnotizing himself in practice , hypnotizability is measured as suggestibility following a hypnotic induction although the induction of hypnosis increases suggestibility to a substantial degree , the correlation between hypnotic and non-hypnotic suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales this indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability it is perhaps the '' necessarily believing it '' that is problematic , as this conception of suggestibility raises issues of the autonomy of attributing belief to an introduced idea , and how this happens popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another in scientific research and academic literature on hypnosis and hypnotherapy , the term '' suggestibility '' describes a neutral psychological and possibly physiological state or phenomena it therefore has a negative effect on expectation and itself is a hypnotic suggestion that suggestions must be noticed and guarded against simple one-word forms of this include the word terrorism where to understand the concept , one must understand the notion of terror and then understand in the sentence that it is meant to refer to '' that '' given object either they are suggested from the mind itself , or in response to introduced suggestions of concepts from outside – the world and its scenarios and facts , or suggestions from other people this predisposes children towards higher levels of suggestibility , and as such children are an important area of suggestibility investigation gist extraction : although children are extremely likely to recall false memory when past events are similar to a current event , they will also recall false memory details that are seemingly unrelated to the event when an interviewer 's tone dictates the questioning , a child is likely to construct memories of past events when they actually have no memory of that event repeating misinformation : repeating misinformation is simply when an interviewer gives a child incorrect details of an event it has been shown to have a great effect on the accuracy of a child 's recollection of an event , and eventually , the misinformation will be included in the child 's account of a given event placebo response is also thought to be based on individual differences in suggestibility , at least in part

deliberately to use one 's imagination or employ strategies to bring about effects ( even if interpreted , eventually , as involuntary ) in response to a communication or expectation to conform overtly to expectations or the views of others , without the appropriate private acceptance or experience ; that is , to exhibit behavioral compliance without private acceptance or belief self-report measures of suggestibility became available in 2004 , and they made it possible to isolate and study the global trait suggestibility can be seen in people 's day-to-day lives : someone witnesses an argument after school a teacher could trick his ap psych students by saying , '' suggestibility is the distortion of memory through suggestion or misinformation , right ? '' it 's likely that the majority of the class would agree with him because he 's a teacher and what he said sounds correct this suggestion caused the young girl to fabricate memories of her father molesting her , which led to her being placed in foster care and her father being tried on charges of abuse hypnotic suggestibility is a trait-like , individual difference variable reflecting the general tendency to respond to hypnosis and hypnotic suggestions research with standardized measures of hypnotic suggestibility has demonstrated that there are substantial individual differences in this variable the extent to which a subject may or may not be '' suggestible '' has significant ramifications in the scientific research of hypnosis and its associated phenomena most hypnotherapists and academics in this field of research work from the premise that hypnotic susceptibility ( or suggestibility ) is a factor in inducing useful hypnosis states that is , the depth of hypnosis a given individual can achieve in a given context with a particular hypnotherapist and particular set of beliefs , expectations and instructions physical suggestibility – a suggestible behavior characterized by a high degree of responsiveness to literal suggestions affecting the body , and restriction of emotional responses ; usually associated with cataleptic stages or deeper intellectual suggestibility – the type of hypnotic suggestibility in which a subject fears being controlled by the operator and is constantly trying to analyze , reject or rationalize everything the operator says conceptually , hypnotizability has always been defined as the increase in suggestibility produced by hypnosis in practice , hypnotizability is measured as suggestibility following a hypnotic induction this indicates that hypnotic susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability popular media and layman 's articles occasionally use the terms '' suggestible '' and '' susceptible '' interchangeably , with reference to the extent to which a given individual responds to incoming suggestions from another the two terms are not synonymous , however , as the latter term carries inherent negative bias absent from the neutral psychological factor described by '' suggestibility '' in scientific research and academic literature on hypnosis and hypnotherapy , the term '' suggestibility '' describes a neutral psychological and possibly physiological state or phenomena perhaps this can be seen in historical cases of mass hypnosis where also there has been media suppression this predisposes children towards higher levels of suggestibility , and as such children are an important area of suggestibility investigation when an interviewer 's tone dictates the questioning , a child is likely to construct memories of past events when they actually have no memory of that event in some cases , children who were not present for an event will later recall witnessing the event as well as details about the event in extreme events such as sexual abuse , extreme anxiety or mistreatment , children can in fact be greatly subjected to suggestibility while it is true that did sufferers tend to score to the higher end of the hypnotizability scale , there have not been enough studies done to support the claim of increased suggestibility studies of effects of health interventions can be enhanced by controlling for individual differences in suggestibility

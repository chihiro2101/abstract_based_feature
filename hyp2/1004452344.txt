the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 '' schenectady-to-leipzig television a success ; movie also made of images sent by radio '' , the new york times , feb there is some evidence to suggest that the bbc experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of world war ii according to a 1949 film produced by rca , silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images by early 1946 , television cameras were being attached to american guided missiles to aid in their remote steering . getty images : a view of the '' cafe continental '' stage set in the television studio at radiolympia theatre , london , september 1947 in the era before satellite communications , kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the commonwealth that had started a television service a royal air force aircraft would fly the telerecording from the uk to canada , where it would be broadcast over the whole north american network even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour most , if not all , videotapes from the 405-line era have long since been wiped as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of colour consequently , the majority of british shows that still exist before the introduction of colour , and a number thereafter , do so in the form of these telerecordings a handful of shows , including some episodes of doctor who and most of the first series of adam adamant lives ! , were deliberately telerecorded for ease of editing rather than being videotaped in september 1947 , eastman kodak introduced the eastman television recording camera , in cooperation with allen b dumont and nbc , for recording images from a television screen under the trademark '' kinephoto '' prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956 , kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts , or to distribute network television programs that were broadcast live from new york or other originating cities , to stations not connected to the network , or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast nbc , cbs , and dumont set up their main kinescope recording facilities in new york city , while abc chose chicago after the network of coaxial cable and microwave relays carrying programs to the west coast was completed in september 1951 , '' coast to coast '' , time , august 13 , 1951 to save the time to make a print , the 35 mm negative was broadcast , and electronically converted to a positive image even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing it was impossible to slow or freeze frame a videotape at that time , so the unedited tape would be copied to a kinescope , and edited conventionally the edited kinescope print was then used to conform the videotape master more than 300 videotaped network series and specials used this method over a 12-year period , including the fast-paced rowan & martin 's laugh-in normally , a live program originating from los angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the eastern time zone , and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the pacific time zone it saw that film , produced especially for television , was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the home receiver as well as ensuring a flawless show the program director of the dumont television network , james l an electronicam technician threw switches to mark the film footage electronically , identifying the camera '' takes '' called by the director the dumont network did not survive into the era of videotape , and in order to gain clearances for its programs , was heavily dependent on kinescopes , which it called teletranscriptions attempts were made for many years to take television images , convert them to film via kinescope , then project them in theaters for paying audiences in 1951 , singer bing crosby ’ s company bing crosby enterprises made the first experimental magnetic video recordings ; however , the poor picture quality and very high tape speed meant it would be impractical to use offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost , quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts television networks continued to make kinescopes of their daytime dramas available ( many of which still aired live into the late 1960s ) as late as 1969 for their smaller network affiliates that did not yet have videotape capability but wished to time-shift the network programming the last 16 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes of television programs ended in the late 1970s , as video tape recorders became more affordable even the best live transmission could look hazy by the time it reached the home viewer advances in broadcast technology soon allowed for a wider gray scale in black-and-white , and a fuller spectrum of colors , making kinescopes a perfectly viable commodity reviewers were astonished at how good the kinescoped image looked on a large screen secondly , they could be used in any country regardless of the television broadcasting standard , which was not true of videotape thirdly , the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s , any ( color ) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film british broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s , with 35 & nbsp ; mm being the film gauge usually used as it produced a higher quality result thumb kinescopes were intended to be used for immediate rebroadcast , or for an occasional repeat of a prerecorded program ; thus , only a small fraction of kinescope recordings remain today nearly every pre-1960s british television programme in the archives is in the form of a telerecording , along with the vast majority of existing 1960s output a kinescope must be able to : convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s , the standard sound speed of film cameras , do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a film chain back to 30 frame/s by law , all film supplied to tv stations , both 16 & nbsp ; mm and 35 & nbsp ; mm had to be on a non-flammable , safety film base some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the same frame rate of 30 full frames per second , resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second in the era of early color tv , the chroma information included in the video signal filmed could cause chroma dots the game was thought lost forever , but was preserved due to crosby 's superstition about watching the game live

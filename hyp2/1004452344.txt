the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 '' schenectady-to-leipzig television a success ; movie also made of images sent by radio '' , the new york times , feb there is some evidence to suggest that the bbc experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of world war ii however , the evidence for this is purely anecdotal , and indeed there is no written record of any bbc television production of the scarlet pimpernel during the 1936–1939 period according to a 1949 film produced by rca , silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images by the mid-1940s , rca and nbc were refining the filming process and including sound ; the images were less jerky but still somewhat fuzzy peck , '' doom on the wing '' , popular science , february 1946 , p films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile 's performance a complete 7-hour set of telerecordings of queen elizabeth ii 's 1953 coronation also exists a royal air force aircraft would fly the telerecording from the uk to canada , where it would be broadcast over the whole north american network even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour eastman television recording camera in september 1947 , eastman kodak introduced the eastman television recording camera , in cooperation with allen b by 1951 , nbc and cbs were each shipping out some 1,000 16mm kinescope prints each week to their affiliates across the united states , and by 1955 that number had increased to 2,500 per week for cbs by 1954 the television industry 's film consumption surpassed that of all of the hollywood studios combined even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing with the variable quality of kinescopes , networks looked towards alternative methods to replace them with a higher degree of quality change to 35 & nbsp ; mm film broadcasts programs originally shot with film cameras ( as opposed to kinescopes ) were also used in television 's early years , although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production '' live '' programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy in 1951 , the stars and producers of the hollywood-based television series i love lucy , desi arnaz and lucille ball , decided to film the show directly onto 35 & nbsp ; mm film using the multicamera setup , instead of broadcasting it live it saw that film , produced especially for television , was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the home receiver as well as ensuring a flawless show an electronicam technician threw switches to mark the film footage electronically , identifying the camera '' takes '' called by the director attempts were made for many years to take television images , convert them to film via kinescope , then project them in theaters for paying audiences in the mid-1960s , producer/entrepreneur h used conventional analog image orthicon video camera tube units , shooting in the b & w 819-line interlaced 25fps french video standard , using modified high-band quadruplex vtrs to record the signal the promoters of electronovision ( not to be confused with electronicam ) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch , using a high-tech name ( and avoiding the word kinescope ) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost , quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts television networks continued to make kinescopes of their daytime dramas available ( many of which still aired live into the late 1960s ) as late as 1969 for their smaller network affiliates that did not yet have videotape capability but wished to time-shift the network programming in later years , film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality up until the early 1960s , much of the bbc 's output , and british television in general , was broadcast live , and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings , which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time thirdly , the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color the telerecording system could be of a very high quality , easily reproducing the full detail of the television picture the major drawback , apart from the short duration of a 16 & nbsp ; mm film magazine , was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the tv set in order to block out any stray reflections , making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming for overseas sales , 16 & nbsp ; mm film would be used , as it was cheaper if there were no videotape machines available on a given day , then a telerecording would be made after this point , however , cheap domestic videotape formats such as vhs could more easily be used to keep a back-up reference copy of a program another occasional use of telerecording into the late 1980s was by documentary makers working in 16 & nbsp ; mm film who wished to include a videotape-sourced excerpt in their work , although such use was again rare most of the programs , like tv dramas , were recorded on video , but only a few programmes continued to be telerecorded onto 16mm film the last telerecording was produced in 1969 and soon after all programmes were recorded on video only kinescopes were also used for some live television programs , like captain kangaroo , when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones in the british 405-line television system , the french 819-line television system and the greater european 576i , television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly , 50 fields—per second , so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames for kinescopes , 16 & nbsp ; mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing , but in the larger network markets , it was not uncommon to see 35 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes , particularly for national rebroadcast some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the same frame rate of 30 full frames per second , resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second in the era of early color tv , the chroma information included in the video signal filmed could cause chroma dots today however , efforts are made to preserve the few surviving dumont kinescopes , with the ucla film and television archive having collected over 300 for preservation early australian television drama series were recorded as kinescopes , such as autumn affair and emergency , along with variety series like the lorrae desmond show

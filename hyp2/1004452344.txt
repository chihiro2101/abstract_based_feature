the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 '' schenectady-to-leipzig television a success ; movie also made of images sent by radio '' , the new york times , feb there is some evidence to suggest that the bbc experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of world war ii a bbc executive , cecil madden , later recalled filming a production of the scarlet pimpernel in this way , only for film director alexander korda to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book , which he felt had been infringed however , the evidence for this is purely anecdotal , and indeed there is no written record of any bbc television production of the scarlet pimpernel during the 1936–1939 period the incident is , however , dramatised in jack rosenthal 's 1986 television play the fools on the hill according to a 1949 film produced by rca , silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images by the mid-1940s , rca and nbc were refining the filming process and including sound ; the images were less jerky but still somewhat fuzzy films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile 's performance albert abramson , the history of television , 1942 to 2000 , mcfarland , 2003 , p the first known surviving example of the telerecording process in britain is from october 1947 , showing the singer adelaide hall performing at the radiolympia event in the era before satellite communications , kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the commonwealth that had started a television service even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour consequently , the majority of british shows that still exist before the introduction of colour , and a number thereafter , do so in the form of these telerecordings dumont and nbc , for recording images from a television screen under the trademark '' kinephoto '' although the quality was less than desirable , television programs of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner nbc , cbs , and dumont set up their main kinescope recording facilities in new york city , while abc chose chicago after the network of coaxial cable and microwave relays carrying programs to the west coast was completed in september 1951 , '' coast to coast '' , time , august 13 , 1951 the soundtrack for the 35 mm film was recorded on a separate 16 mm filmstrip , and synchronized at playback the soundtrack for the 16 mm reversal film version was recorded on the same filmstrip as the image even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing change to 35 & nbsp ; mm film broadcasts programs originally shot with film cameras ( as opposed to kinescopes ) were also used in television 's early years , although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production '' live '' programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy in 1951 , the stars and producers of the hollywood-based television series i love lucy , desi arnaz and lucille ball , decided to film the show directly onto 35 & nbsp ; mm film using the multicamera setup , instead of broadcasting it live but as an article in american cinematographer explained , : in the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of desilu productions to put i love lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network the i love lucy decision introduced reruns to most of the american television audience , and set a pattern for the syndication of tv shows after their network runs ( and later , for first-run airings via syndication ) in this , all the studio tv cameras had built-in 35 & nbsp ; mm film cameras which shared the same optical path the corresponding film segments from the various cameras then were combined by a film editor to duplicate the live program attempts were made for many years to take television images , convert them to film via kinescope , then project them in theaters for paying audiences a recording of a 1975 episode of australian series this day tonight is listed on the national archives of australia website as a kinescope , while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series the truckies also exist as kinescopes , indicating that the technology was still being used by abc at that point in later years , film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality up until the early 1960s , much of the bbc 's output , and british television in general , was broadcast live , and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings , which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time thirdly , the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color although some color telerecordings were made , they were generally in the minority as by the time color programs were widely needed for sale , video standards conversion was easier and higher quality and the price of videotape had become much reduced before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s , any ( color ) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film the major drawback , apart from the short duration of a 16 & nbsp ; mm film magazine , was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the tv set in order to block out any stray reflections , making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming british broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s , with 35 & nbsp ; mm being the film gauge usually used as it produced a higher quality result although domestic use of telerecording in the uk for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to color in the late 1960s , 16 & nbsp ; mm black and white film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by british broadcasters well into the 1970s the last telerecording was produced in 1969 and soon after all programmes were recorded on video only list of lost television broadcasts , such as with the early television work of comedian ernie kovacs , and the original version of jeopardy ! hosted by art fleming due to this practice , some kinescopes have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves kinescopes were also used for some live television programs , like captain kangaroo , when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones a 35 & nbsp ; mm or 16 & nbsp ; mm camera exposes one frame of film for every one frame of television ( 525 lines ) , and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television ( 131.25 lines ) 40 & nbsp ; mm or 50 & nbsp ; mm lenses were usually used with 16mm in calibrated mounts stations recording on 35 & nbsp ; mm utilized magazines for one hour of continuous recording in recent years , the bbc has introduced a video process called vidfire , which can restore kinescope recordings to their original frame rate by interpolating video fields between the film frames

the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 '' schenectady-to-leipzig television a success ; movie also made of images sent by radio '' , the new york times , feb there is some evidence to suggest that the bbc experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of world war ii a bbc executive , cecil madden , later recalled filming a production of the scarlet pimpernel in this way , only for film director alexander korda to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book , which he felt had been infringed however , the evidence for this is purely anecdotal , and indeed there is no written record of any bbc television production of the scarlet pimpernel during the 1936–1939 period according to a 1949 film produced by rca , silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile 's performance the first known surviving example of the telerecording process in britain is from october 1947 , showing the singer adelaide hall performing at the radiolympia event . getty images : a view of the '' cafe continental '' stage set in the television studio at radiolympia theatre , london , september 1947 a royal air force aircraft would fly the telerecording from the uk to canada , where it would be broadcast over the whole north american network even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour most , if not all , videotapes from the 405-line era have long since been wiped as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of colour prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956 , kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts , or to distribute network television programs that were broadcast live from new york or other originating cities , to stations not connected to the network , or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast although the quality was less than desirable , television programs of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner by 1951 , nbc and cbs were each shipping out some 1,000 16mm kinescope prints each week to their affiliates across the united states , and by 1955 that number had increased to 2,500 per week for cbs after the network of coaxial cable and microwave relays carrying programs to the west coast was completed in september 1951 , '' coast to coast '' , time , august 13 , 1951 in september 1956 , nbc began making color '' hot kines '' of some of its color programs using a lenticular film process which , unlike color negative film , could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing it was impossible to slow or freeze frame a videotape at that time , so the unedited tape would be copied to a kinescope , and edited conventionally programs originally shot with film cameras ( as opposed to kinescopes ) were also used in television 's early years , although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production '' live '' programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy in 1951 , the stars and producers of the hollywood-based television series i love lucy , desi arnaz and lucille ball , decided to film the show directly onto 35 & nbsp ; mm film using the multicamera setup , instead of broadcasting it live normally , a live program originating from los angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the eastern time zone , and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the pacific time zone but as an article in american cinematographer explained , : in the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of desilu productions to put i love lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network the corresponding film segments from the various cameras then were combined by a film editor to duplicate the live program the dumont network did not survive into the era of videotape , and in order to gain clearances for its programs , was heavily dependent on kinescopes , which it called teletranscriptions used conventional analog image orthicon video camera tube units , shooting in the b & w 819-line interlaced 25fps french video standard , using modified high-band quadruplex vtrs to record the signal the promoters of electronovision ( not to be confused with electronicam ) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch , using a high-tech name ( and avoiding the word kinescope ) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography by capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s , raw tape could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement the 1960s productions used marconi image orthicon video cameras , which have a characteristic white '' glow '' around black objects ( and a corresponding black glow around white objects ) , which was a defect of the pickup later vidicon and plumbicon video camera tubes produced much cleaner , more accurate pictures offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost , quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts the last 16 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes of television programs ended in the late 1970s , as video tape recorders became more affordable in australia , kinescopes were still being made of some evening news programs as late as 1977 , if they were recorded at all in later years , film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality while it is true that kinescopes did look inferior to live transmissions in the 1950s , it was due to the industry 's technical limitations at that time thirdly , the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color the telerecording system could be of a very high quality , easily reproducing the full detail of the television picture in the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in britain , allowing enthusiasts to make 16 mm film recordings of television programs the major drawback , apart from the short duration of a 16 & nbsp ; mm film magazine , was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the tv set in order to block out any stray reflections , making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming british broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s , with 35 & nbsp ; mm being the film gauge usually used as it produced a higher quality result for overseas sales , 16 & nbsp ; mm film would be used , as it was cheaper telerecording was still being used internally at the bbc in the 1980s too , to preserve copies for posterity of programs which were not necessarily of the highest importance , but which nonetheless their producers wanted to be preserved in the british 405-line television system , the french 819-line television system and the greater european 576i , television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly , 50 fields—per second , so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames by law , all film supplied to tv stations , both 16 & nbsp ; mm and 35 & nbsp ; mm had to be on a non-flammable , safety film base some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the same frame rate of 30 full frames per second , resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second in recent years , the bbc has introduced a video process called vidfire , which can restore kinescope recordings to their original frame rate by interpolating video fields between the film frames

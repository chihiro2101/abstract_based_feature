the general electric laboratories in schenectady , new york experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931 '' schenectady-to-leipzig television a success ; movie also made of images sent by radio '' , the new york times , feb there is some evidence to suggest that the bbc experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of world war ii however , the evidence for this is purely anecdotal , and indeed there is no written record of any bbc television production of the scarlet pimpernel during the 1936–1939 period the incident is , however , dramatised in jack rosenthal 's 1986 television play the fools on the hill the films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors – at a speed of eight frames per second , resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images by the mid-1940s , rca and nbc were refining the filming process and including sound ; the images were less jerky but still somewhat fuzzy . getty images : a view of the '' cafe continental '' stage set in the television studio at radiolympia theatre , london , september 1947 from the following month , the wedding of princess elizabeth to prince philip also survives , as do various early 1950s productions such as it is midnight , dr schweitzer , the lady from the sea and the opening two episodes of the quatermass experiment , although in varying degrees of quality in the era before satellite communications , kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the commonwealth that had started a television service even after the introduction of videotape , the bbc and the itv companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales , and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour eastman television recording camera nbc , cbs , and dumont set up their main kinescope recording facilities in new york city , while abc chose chicago in september 1956 , nbc began making color '' hot kines '' of some of its color programs using a lenticular film process which , unlike color negative film , could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods even after the introduction of quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for '' hot kines '' , the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the '' double system '' method of videotape editing more than 300 videotaped network series and specials used this method over a 12-year period , including the fast-paced rowan & martin 's laugh-in programs originally shot with film cameras ( as opposed to kinescopes ) were also used in television 's early years , although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production '' live '' programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy normally , a live program originating from los angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the eastern time zone , and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the pacific time zone but as an article in american cinematographer explained , : in the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of desilu productions to put i love lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network the i love lucy decision introduced reruns to most of the american television audience , and set a pattern for the syndication of tv shows after their network runs ( and later , for first-run airings via syndication ) in this , all the studio tv cameras had built-in 35 & nbsp ; mm film cameras which shared the same optical path an electronicam technician threw switches to mark the film footage electronically , identifying the camera '' takes '' called by the director the dumont network did not survive into the era of videotape , and in order to gain clearances for its programs , was heavily dependent on kinescopes , which it called teletranscriptions used conventional analog image orthicon video camera tube units , shooting in the b & w 819-line interlaced 25fps french video standard , using modified high-band quadruplex vtrs to record the signal the last 16 & nbsp ; mm kinescopes of television programs ended in the late 1970s , as video tape recorders became more affordable a recording of a 1975 episode of australian series this day tonight is listed on the national archives of australia website as a kinescope , while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series the truckies also exist as kinescopes , indicating that the technology was still being used by abc at that point in later years , film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality advances in broadcast technology soon allowed for a wider gray scale in black-and-white , and a fuller spectrum of colors , making kinescopes a perfectly viable commodity the telerecording system could be of a very high quality , easily reproducing the full detail of the television picture one side effect of the system was that it removed the 'fluid ' look of interlaced video and 'filmized ' the picture in the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in britain , allowing enthusiasts to make 16 mm film recordings of television programs thumb kinescopes were intended to be used for immediate rebroadcast , or for an occasional repeat of a prerecorded program ; thus , only a small fraction of kinescope recordings remain today another purpose of kinescopes involved satisfying show sponsors due to this practice , some kinescopes have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves telerecordings form an important part of british television heritage , preserving what would otherwise have been lost many recovered programmes , particularly those made by the bbc , have been returned as telerecordings by foreign broadcasters or private film collectors from the 1980s onwards , as the bbc has taken stock of the large gaps in its archive and sought to recover as much of the missing material as possible many of these surviving telerecorded programmes , such as episodes of doctor who , steptoe and son and till death us do part continue to be transmitted on satellite television stations such as uktv gold , and many such programmes have been released on vhs and dvd in 2008 , the bbc undertook colour recovery work on the existing 16mm monochrome telerecording of room at the bottom , a 1969 episode of the sitcom dad 's army ntsc television images are scanned at roughly 60 hz , with two interlaced fields per frame , displayed at 30 frames per second a kinescope must be able to : convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s , the standard sound speed of film cameras , do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a film chain back to 30 frame/s in the british 405-line television system , the french 819-line television system and the greater european 576i , television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly , 50 fields—per second , so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames therefore , in order to maintain successful kinescope photography , a camera must expose one frame of film for exactly 1/30th or 1/25th of a second , the time in which one frame of video is transmitted , and move to another frame of film within the small interval of 1/120 of a second using this shutter , in 1 second of video ( 60 fields equaling 30 frames ) , 48 television fields ( totaling to 24 frames of video ) would be captured on 24 frames of film , and 12 additional fields would be omitted as the shutter closed and the film advanced dupont : fine grain master positive film type 628a ( 16 & nbsp ; mm ) and 628b ( 35 & nbsp ; mm ) remley wrote of kinescope recordings , : because of the many variables in the combined electronic/photographic process , the quality of such recordings often leaves much to be desired some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the same frame rate of 30 full frames per second , resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second kinescopes continued to be made after video-tape was introduced to australia ; most existing episodes of the 1965–1967 children 's series magic circle club are kinescopes ( per listings for episodes on national film and sound archive website )

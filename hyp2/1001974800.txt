johnson space center has its origins in nasa 's space task group ( stg ) starting on november 5 , 1958 , langley research center engineers under robert gilruth directed project mercury and follow-on crewed space programs the stg originally reported to the goddard space flight center organization , with a total staff of 45 , including 37 engineers , and eight secretaries and human computer ( women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines ) keith glennan , realized that the growth of the us space program would cause the stg to outgrow the langley and goddard centers and require its own location in 1961 , congress held hearings and passed a 1.7 & nbsp ; billion 1962 nasa appropriations bill which included 60 & nbsp ; million for the new crewed spaceflight laboratory in august 1961 , webb asked associate director of the ames research center john f following its tour , the team identified macdill air force base in tampa as its first choice , based on the fact the air force was planning to close down its strategic air command operations there before a decision could be made , however , the air force decided not to close macdill , omitting it from consideration and moving the rice university site to first place '' the land for the new facility was donated to rice by the humble oil company , situated in an undeveloped area southeast of houston adjacent to clear lake near galveston bay tracts of land in the vicinity of the manned spacecraft center were either owned or being under exclusive control of joseph l construction of the center , designed by charles luckman , began in april 1962 , and gilruth 's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by september in 1961 , as plans for project gemini began , it became increasingly clear that the mercury control center located at the cape canaveral air force station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as gemini and apollo philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new mission control center , which would be located in building 30 of msc rather than canaveral or the goddard space flight center in maryland it became fully operational for the flight of gemini 4 the following june , and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent us crewed space missions from project gemini forward the center 's landing and recovery division operated mv retriever in the gulf of mexico for gemini and apollo astronauts to practice water egress after splashdown one of the artifacts displayed at johnson space center is the saturn v rocket a similar memorial service was held at the johnson space center on february 4 , 2003 , for the astronauts who perished in the space shuttle columbia disaster three days before , which was attended by president george w the johnson space center is home to christopher c candidates are also required to become scuba-qualified for extravehicular training and are required to pass a swimming test johnson space center leads nasa 's human spaceflight-related scientific and medical research programs the responsibilities of ares also include interaction with the office of safety and mission assurance and the human space flight programs the overset grid-flow software was developed at johnson space center in collaboration with nasa ames research center

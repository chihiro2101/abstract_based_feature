shame is a discrete , basic emotion , described as a moral or social emotion that drives people to hide or deny their wrongdoings the focus of shame is on the self or the individual with respect to a perceived audience shame can also be described as an unpleasant self-conscious emotion that involves negative evaluation of the self shame can be a painful emotion that is seen as a '' '' but may equally stem from comparison of the self 's state of being with the ideal social context 's standard some scales measure shame to assess emotional states , whereas other shame scales are used to assess emotional traits or dispositions- shame proneness '' to shame '' generally means to actively assign or communicate a state of shame to another person behaviors designed to '' uncover '' or '' expose '' others are sometimes used to place shame on the other person whereas , having shame means to maintain a sense of restraint against offending others ( as with modesty , humility , and deference ) more commonly , the act of crying can be associated with shame studies of shame showed that when ashamed people feel that their entire self is worthless , powerless , and small , they also feel exposed to an audience—real or imagined—that exists purely for the purpose of confirming that the self is worthless shame and the sense of self is stigmatized , or treated unfairly , like being overtly rejected by parents in favor of siblings ' needs , and is assigned externally by others regardless of one 's own experience or awareness an individual who is in a state of shame will assign the shame internally from being a victim of the environment , and the same is assigned externally , or assigned by others regardless of one 's own experience or awareness a '' sense of shame '' is the feeling known as guilt but '' consciousness '' or awareness of '' shame as a state '' or condition defines core/toxic shame ( lewis , 1971 ; tangney , 1998 ) the person experiencing shame might not be able to , or perhaps simply will not , identify their emotional state as shame , and there is an intrinsic connection between shame and the mechanism of denial people employ negative coping responses to counter deep rooted , associated sense of '' shameworthiness '' shame , devaluation and their interrelationship are similar across cultures , prompting some researchers to suggest that there is a universal human psychology of cultural valuation and devaluation shame proneness was associated with more fidgeting and less freezing , but both stillness and fidgeting are social cues that communicate distress to observers , and may elicit less harsh responses thus , both may be an attempt to diminish further shaming experiences the boundaries between concepts of shame , guilt , and embarrassment are not easily delineated lewis argued that , '' the experience of shame is directly about the self , which is the focus of evaluation '' similarly , fossum and mason say in their book facing shame that '' while guilt is a painful feeling of regret and responsibility for one 's actions , shame is a painful feeling about oneself as a person '' clinical psychologist gershen kaufman 's view of shame is derived from that of affect theory , namely that shame is one of a set of instinctual , short-duration physiological reactions to stimulation in this view , guilt is considered to be a learned behavior consisting essentially of self-directed blame or contempt , with shame occurring consequent to such behaviors making up a part of the overall experience of guilt kaufman saw that mechanisms such as blame or contempt may be used as a defending strategy against the experience of shame and that someone who has a pattern of applying them to himself may well attempt to defend against a shame experience by applying self-blame or self-contempt this , however , can lead to an internalized , self-reinforcing sequence of shame events for which kaufman coined the term '' shame spiral '' shame can also be used as a strategy when feeling guilt , in particular when there is the hope to avoid punishment by inspiring pity another view of the dividing line between shame and embarrassment holds that the difference is one of intensity extreme or toxic shame is a much more intense experience and one that is not functional immanuel kant and his followers held that shame is heteronomous ( comes from others ) ; bernard williams and others have argued that shame can be autonomous ( comes from oneself ) another view of shame and guilt is that shame is a focus on self , while guilt is a focus on behavior so , because shame is focused on the entire self , those who become embarrassed apologize for their mistake , and then begin to repair things and this repair involves redressing harm done to the presented self whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others this is a mature heteronomous type of shame where the agent does not judge herself negatively , but , due to the negative judgments of others , suspects that she may deserve negative judgment , and feel shame on this basis therefore , shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable there are many different reasons that people might feel shame it has been suggested that narcissism in adults is related to defenses against shame wurmser l , shame , the veiled companion of narcissism , in the many faces of shame , edited by nathanson dl in this sense , '' the real purpose of shaming is not to punish crimes but to create the kind of people who do n't commit them '' the study shows that placing more shame and stigma in the mind of people can be more prone to protecting themselves from the consequences that follow the action of unprotected sex some of these tools include the guilt and shame proneness ( gasp ) scale , the shame and stigma scale ( sss ) , the experience of shame scale , and the internalized shame scale

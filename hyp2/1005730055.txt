nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters , which were usually small versions of woofers many soft dome tweeter diaphragms are thermoformed from polyester film , or silk or polyester fabric that has been impregnated with a polymer resin hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium , aluminium-magnesium alloys , or titanium tweeters can also work in collaboration with the woofers that are responsible for generating the low frequencies or bass ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 & nbsp ; khz and even 100 & nbsp ; khz three properties designers look for in domes are low mass , high stiffness and good damping nowadays other metals such as aluminium , titanium , magnesium , and beryllium , as well as various alloys thereof , are used , being both light and stiff but having low damping ; their resonant modes occur above 20 & nbsp ; khz however , smaller dome tweeters have less radiating area , which limits their output at the lower end of their range ; and they have smaller voice coils , which limit their overall power output ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil the fluid is typically injected into the magnetic gap and is held in place by the strong magnetic field tweeters designed for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters , though they 're usually not referred to as tweeters , but as '' high frequency drivers '' high frequency drivers in pa horns are often referred to as '' compression drivers '' from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat the diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former , typically made from a different material from the dome , since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change a professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 & nbsp ; db/watt/meter this is substantially more efficient ( and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former ) than other tweeter construction many designers therefore believed this made them a good match to cone midranges and woofers , allowing for superb stereo imaging audiophiles felt that cone tweeters lacked the '' airiness '' of dome tweeters or other types nevertheless , many high-end cone tweeters remained in limited production by audax , jbl and seas until the mid-1980s some boutique speaker manufacturers recently have returned to high-end cone tweeters , especially recreations of cts phenolic ring models , to create a vintage-sounding product a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) this type of speaker employs a thin diaphragm ( generally plastic and typically pet film ) , with a thin conductive coating , suspended between two screens or perforated metal sheets , referred to as stators electrostatics of this type necessarily include a high voltage power supply to provide the high voltage used the larger the horn , the lower the frequencies at which it can work , since large horns provide coupling to the air at lower frequencies loudspeaker enclosure audio crossover full-range speaker super tweeter midrange speaker woofer subwoofer plasma speaker

nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field these designs operate by applying current from the output of an amplifier circuit to a coil of wire called a voice coil the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters , which were usually small versions of woofers hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium , aluminium-magnesium alloys , or titanium tweeters are intended to convert an electrical signal into mechanical air movement with nothing added or subtracted , but the process is imperfect , and real-world tweeters involve tradeoffs tweeters can also work in collaboration with the woofers that are responsible for generating the low frequencies or bass examples include '' super tweeters and the novel '' egg tweeter '' by ohm ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 & nbsp ; khz and even 100 & nbsp ; khz nowadays other metals such as aluminium , titanium , magnesium , and beryllium , as well as various alloys thereof , are used , being both light and stiff but having low damping ; their resonant modes occur above 20 & nbsp ; khz polyethylene terephthalate film and woven silk suffer less ringing , but are not nearly as stiff , which can limit their very high frequency output however , smaller dome tweeters have less radiating area , which limits their output at the lower end of their range ; and they have smaller voice coils , which limit their overall power output ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil the diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former , typically made from a different material from the dome , since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change this is substantially more efficient ( and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former ) than other tweeter construction cone tweeters were popular in older stereo hi-fi speakers designed and manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to the dome tweeter ( which was developed in the late 1950s ) cone tweeters today are often relatively cheap , but many of those in the past were of high quality , such as those made by audax/polydax , bozak , cts , jbl , tonegen and seas typical of the 1960s/1970s-era was the cts '' phenolic ring '' cone tweeters , exhibiting flat response from 2,000 to 15,000 & nbsp ; hz , low distortion and fast transient response the cts '' phenolic ring '' tweeter gets its name from the orange-colored edge suspension ring that it has which is made from phenolic cone tweeters have a narrower dispersion characteristic that is the same as a cone woofer 's some boutique speaker manufacturers recently have returned to high-end cone tweeters , especially recreations of cts phenolic ring models , to create a vintage-sounding product dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) the overwhelming majority of dome tweeters presently used in hi-fi speakers are 25 & nbsp ; mm ( 1 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter horn tweeters may have a somewhat 'different ' sonic signature than simple dome tweeters these types of tweeters are not capable of high output , nor of other than very high frequency reproduction , and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels loudspeaker enclosure audio crossover full-range speaker super tweeter midrange speaker woofer subwoofer plasma speaker

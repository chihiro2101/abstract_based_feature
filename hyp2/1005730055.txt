nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move this mechanical movement resembles the waveform of the electronic signal supplied from the amplifier 's output to the voice coil since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds many soft dome tweeter diaphragms are thermoformed from polyester film , or silk or polyester fabric that has been impregnated with a polymer resin hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium , aluminium-magnesium alloys , or titanium examples include '' super tweeters and the novel '' egg tweeter '' by ohm ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 & nbsp ; khz and even 100 & nbsp ; khz three properties designers look for in domes are low mass , high stiffness and good damping celestion were the first manufacturers to fabricate dome tweeters out of a metal , copper nowadays other metals such as aluminium , titanium , magnesium , and beryllium , as well as various alloys thereof , are used , being both light and stiff but having low damping ; their resonant modes occur above 20 & nbsp ; khz in general , smaller dome tweeters provide wider dispersion of sound at the highest frequencies however , smaller dome tweeters have less radiating area , which limits their output at the lower end of their range ; and they have smaller voice coils , which limit their overall power output ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil ferrofluid also aids in centering the voice coil in the magnetic gap , reducing distortion tweeters designed for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters , though they 're usually not referred to as tweeters , but as '' high frequency drivers '' the diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former , typically made from a different material from the dome , since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change image : conetweetermarantz.jpg thumb right the cone tweeter from a marantz 5g loudspeaker cone tweeters have the same basic design and form as a woofer with optimizations to operate at higher frequencies the optimizations usually are : a very small and light cone so it can move rapidly ; cone materials chosen for stiffness ( e.g cone tweeters were popular in older stereo hi-fi speakers designed and manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to the dome tweeter ( which was developed in the late 1950s ) many designers therefore believed this made them a good match to cone midranges and woofers , allowing for superb stereo imaging cone tweeters are now rarely used in modern hi-fi usage and are routinely seen in low cost applications such as factory car speakers , compact stereo systems , and boom boxes a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) the overwhelming majority of dome tweeters presently used in hi-fi speakers are 25 & nbsp ; mm ( 1 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter these types of tweeters are not capable of high output , nor of other than very high frequency reproduction , and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels loudspeaker enclosure audio crossover full-range speaker super tweeter midrange speaker woofer subwoofer plasma speaker

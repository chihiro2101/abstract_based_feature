nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field these designs operate by applying current from the output of an amplifier circuit to a coil of wire called a voice coil the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters , which were usually small versions of woofers many soft dome tweeter diaphragms are thermoformed from polyester film , or silk or polyester fabric that has been impregnated with a polymer resin hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium , aluminium-magnesium alloys , or titanium tweeters are intended to convert an electrical signal into mechanical air movement with nothing added or subtracted , but the process is imperfect , and real-world tweeters involve tradeoffs ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 & nbsp ; khz and even 100 & nbsp ; khz nowadays other metals such as aluminium , titanium , magnesium , and beryllium , as well as various alloys thereof , are used , being both light and stiff but having low damping ; their resonant modes occur above 20 & nbsp ; khz polyethylene terephthalate film and woven silk suffer less ringing , but are not nearly as stiff , which can limit their very high frequency output ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil high frequency drivers in pa horns are often referred to as '' compression drivers '' from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat image : conetweetermarantz.jpg thumb right the cone tweeter from a marantz 5g loudspeaker cone tweeters have the same basic design and form as a woofer with optimizations to operate at higher frequencies the optimizations usually are : a very small and light cone so it can move rapidly ; cone materials chosen for stiffness ( e.g , paper , silk or coated fabric ) or both ; a suspension ( or spider ) that is stiffer than for other driversâ€”less flexibility is needed for high frequency reproduction ; small voice coils ( 3/4 inch is typical ) and light ( thin ) wire , which also helps the tweeter cone move rapidly these vintage cone tweeters exhibited very flat frequency response , low distortion , fast transient response , a low resonance frequency and a gentle low-end roll-off , easing crossover design typical of the 1960s/1970s-era was the cts '' phenolic ring '' cone tweeters , exhibiting flat response from 2,000 to 15,000 & nbsp ; hz , low distortion and fast transient response however , the '' sweet spot '' created by the narrow dispersion of cone tweeters is small during the 1970s and 1980s , the widespread introduction of higher quality audiophile discs and the advent of the cd caused the cone tweeter to fall out of popularity because cone tweeters seldom extend past 15 & nbsp ; khz audiophiles felt that cone tweeters lacked the '' airiness '' of dome tweeters or other types a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) the overwhelming majority of dome tweeters presently used in hi-fi speakers are 25 & nbsp ; mm ( 1 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter the tweeter in either case is usually termed a compression driver and is quite different from more common types of tweeters ( see above ) these types of tweeters are not capable of high output , nor of other than very high frequency reproduction , and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels loudspeaker enclosure audio crossover full-range speaker super tweeter midrange speaker woofer subwoofer plasma speaker

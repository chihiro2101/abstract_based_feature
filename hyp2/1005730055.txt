nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field these designs operate by applying current from the output of an amplifier circuit to a coil of wire called a voice coil the voice coil produces a varying magnetic field , which works against the fixed magnetic field of a magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended , forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move this mechanical movement resembles the waveform of the electronic signal supplied from the amplifier 's output to the voice coil since the coil is attached to a diaphragm , the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm ; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air , thus creating air motions or audio waves , which is heard as high sounds modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters , which were usually small versions of woofers hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium , aluminium-magnesium alloys , or titanium tweeters are intended to convert an electrical signal into mechanical air movement with nothing added or subtracted , but the process is imperfect , and real-world tweeters involve tradeoffs tweeters can also work in collaboration with the woofers that are responsible for generating the low frequencies or bass polyethylene terephthalate film and woven silk suffer less ringing , but are not nearly as stiff , which can limit their very high frequency output in general , smaller dome tweeters provide wider dispersion of sound at the highest frequencies ferrofluid is a suspension of very small ( typically 10 & nbsp ; nm ) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid , typically a synthetic oil tweeters designed for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters , though they 're usually not referred to as tweeters , but as '' high frequency drivers '' high frequency drivers in pa horns are often referred to as '' compression drivers '' from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat this is substantially more efficient ( and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former ) than other tweeter construction image : conetweetermarantz.jpg thumb right the cone tweeter from a marantz 5g loudspeaker cone tweeters have the same basic design and form as a woofer with optimizations to operate at higher frequencies speakers with cone tweeters offered the best stereo imaging when positioned in the room 's corners , a common practice in the 1950s , 1960s and early 1970s audiophiles felt that cone tweeters lacked the '' airiness '' of dome tweeters or other types nevertheless , many high-end cone tweeters remained in limited production by audax , jbl and seas until the mid-1980s cone tweeters are now rarely used in modern hi-fi usage and are routinely seen in low cost applications such as factory car speakers , compact stereo systems , and boom boxes some boutique speaker manufacturers recently have returned to high-end cone tweeters , especially recreations of cts phenolic ring models , to create a vintage-sounding product a dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome ( made of woven fabric , thin metal or other suitable material ) , which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter , and range from 19 & nbsp ; mm ( 0.75 & nbsp ; in ) , through 38 & nbsp ; mm ( 1.5 & nbsp ; in ) the ribbon is of very lightweight material and so capable of very high acceleration and extended high frequency response horns are used for two purposes â€” to control dispersion , and to couple the tweeter diaphragm to the air for higher efficiency these types of tweeters are not capable of high output , nor of other than very high frequency reproduction , and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels those who have heard the ionovacs report that , in a sensibly designed loudspeaker system , the highs were 'airy ' and very detailed , though high output was n't possible

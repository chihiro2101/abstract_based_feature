curry 's paradox uses a particular kind of self-referential conditional sentence , as demonstrated in this example : even though germany does not border china , the example sentence certainly is a natural-language sentence , and so the truth of that sentence can be analyzed first , common natural-language proof techniques can be used to prove that the example sentence is true second , the truth of the example sentence can be used to prove that germany borders china the claim '' germany borders china '' could be replaced by any other claim , and the sentence would still be provable in this method , in order to prove '' if a , then b '' , first a is assumed and then with that assumption b is shown to be true to produce curry 's paradox , as described in the two steps above , apply this method to the sentence '' if this sentence is true , then germany borders china '' here a , '' this sentence is true '' , refers to the overall sentence , while b is '' germany borders china '' now , because we have proved '' if this sentence is true , then 'germany borders china ' is true '' , then we can again apply modus ponens , because we know that the claim '' this sentence is true '' is correct curry 's paradox also occurs in some varieties of formal logic in this context , it shows that if we assume there is a formal sentence ( x → y ) , where x itself is equivalent to ( x → y ) , then we can prove y with a formal proof even if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences , certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to curry 's paradox in set theories that allow unrestricted comprehension , we can nevertheless prove any logical statement y by examining the set can only represent +2 curry 's paradox and other paradoxes arise in lambda calculus because of the inconsistency of lambda calculus considered as a deductive system but each call to eval in that natural language may be translated into mathematics in a way that is consistent russell 's paradox girard 's paradox kleene–rosser paradox liar paradox list of paradoxes richard 's paradox zermelo–fraenkel set theory fixed-point combinator deductive lambda calculus let expression

the analysis consists of two steps first , common natural-language proof techniques can be used to prove that the example sentence is true second , the truth of the example sentence can be used to prove that germany borders china the claim '' germany borders china '' could be replaced by any other claim , and the sentence would still be provable because the proof uses only well-accepted methods of deduction , and because none of these methods appears to be incorrect , this situation is paradoxical to produce curry 's paradox , as described in the two steps above , apply this method to the sentence '' if this sentence is true , then germany borders china '' now , because we have proved '' if this sentence is true , then 'germany borders china ' is true '' , then we can again apply modus ponens , because we know that the claim '' this sentence is true '' is correct curry 's paradox also occurs in some varieties of formal logic this together with peirce 's law ( ( x → y ) → x ) → x and modus ponens implies x and subsequently y ( as in above proof ) even if the underlying mathematical logic does not admit any self-referential sentences , certain forms of naive set theory are still vulnerable to curry 's paradox lambda calculus allows recursion by passing the same function that is called as a parameter curry 's paradox and other paradoxes arise in lambda calculus because of the inconsistency of lambda calculus considered as a deductive system so curry 's paradox can not be stated in zfc russell 's paradox girard 's paradox kleene–rosser paradox liar paradox list of paradoxes richard 's paradox zermelo–fraenkel set theory fixed-point combinator deductive lambda calculus let expression penguins rule the universe : a proof that penguins rule the universe , a brief and entertaining discussion of curry 's paradox .

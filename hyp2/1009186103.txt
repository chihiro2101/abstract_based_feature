first edition ( c & s1 ) the first edition of chivalry & sorcery , also called the red book was published by fantasy games unlimited in 1977 the rulebook not only contained rules for character creation ( including monster player characters ) , combat , and magic but also wargames rules for battles and sieges in addition to ideas taken from arthurian myth , the first edition also incorporated elements of j thus , c & s has less of a modern literary influence than d & d , dungeons & dragons was heavily influenced by 20th century fantasy literature both the game 's writers and most of its players had at least a passing familiarity with modern fantasy the alignment system ( law vs chaos ) was greatly influenced by moorcock 's eternal champion cycle lovecraft 's cthulhu mythos cycle , fritz leiber 's lankmar series , and michael moorcock 's elric to allow campaigns set in their fictional worlds some non-humans races are superior to humans ( sometimes possessing innate magical abilities , considerable longevity or immortality , racial bonuses to certain skills , etc this is similar to dungeons & dragon 's six attributes , except the attribute of charisma is split into the two primary characteristics of appearance ( physical attractiveness ) and bardic voice ( oration and persuasiveness ) the c & s version of charisma ( leadership ) is a derived secondary characteristic used for leading and inspiring retainers the alignment of a character in chivalry & sorcery is either selected or rolled randomly on a d20 ( dice ) table and is scored from 1 to 20 the system is heavily influenced by the values and teachings of the christian religion chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc , 2000 ) , pp.23-24 a lawful character would be very respectful of the sacred texts and behave like an honest citizen of good morals a neutral character would be self-serving and secular , obeying the rules as they see fit a chaotic-diabolical character would be so horrible and immoral that even the devil and his minions are shocked by them chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc in c & s social status is very important and a random drawing determines the origin and social rank of the character finally , taking into account the characteristics , the astral sign , social background , race and natural inclination , the player decides what role the character will follow a magician can choose among 4 major classes ( natural magic users , minor arcanes , major arcanes , and mystics ) that divide into 19 sub-classes clerics are also present , but are almost exclusively of a monotheistic faith with a christian-like hierarchy ( as the game was intended as a simulation of an essentially medieval christian europe ) chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc clerics can raise their social level through advancing up the church 's hierarchy to become lords spiritual ( like bishops , abbots , knight-commanders , or even the pope ) backhaus , wilf and simbalist , edward chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc the magic system of c & s was very sophisticated and complex it was created by wilf backhaus and inspired mainly by real magic by isaac bonewits the highest mkl a magician can have is 22 ( as the 22 '' major arcana '' cards of occult tarot ) on the other hand , the personal magick factor ( pmf ) of a magician depends on its characteristics and its mkl and defines its ability to affect the world around them in practice , pmf determines the scope and duration of spells and the number of volumes of materials used by the magick user ( see below on magic basic ) if the magician wishes to launch the fireball at an enemy , they must use detach fire a magician who wants to create and launch a fireball at the same time uses a spell with the formula detach create fire bm is much more dangerous than the magic commonly found in other games mkl9 , which is the level at which teachers become magicians and can take a student ) can cast a fireball that causes 130 to 240 body points of damage , with an average damage of 180 different classes of magick users the natural magick users have inborn powers primitive talent magick users make their magic instinctively and are unable to learn spells from a book or to enchant magic items the dance & chant magick user draws power from totem animal spirits they are similar to the elven smiths of eregion who were manipulated by sauron to make the three ( elvish ) , seven ( dwarvish ) , and nine ( mannish ) rings of power in j.r.r there are witches and warlocks who live in convens , specialize in black magic and demonology , and are able not only do magic but to ask invocations and miracles of lucifer and his angels finally , the solitary hex master uses their knowledge of black magic and demons to fight evil , which requires a lawful alignment the enchanter hides their spells in songs and tunes and often takes the disguise of a minstrel who goes from castle to castle when the reach a high enough mkl , they may make the rings of power and one ring that allows great power , as did sauron of mordor the kabbalist ( cabbala-symbolist ) practices their art by the use of symbols that they can draw in the air or carve on objects power word mystics are the masters of words and commands le guin 's earthsea saga finally the mystic square mystics , perhaps the most mysterious of all magicians , use numbers and numerology to perform magic at very high level , their knowledge of the fundamentals of magic is such that they are able to cancel any magic in a wide radius around them , whatever power of magic they meet their knowledge is the most hermetic and difficult to teach , which may explain why this magick users class is very uncommon in c & s campaigns the magic system itself is based on the premise that the world is resistant to magic ( much like in lion rampant 's ars magica and white wolf 's mage : the ascension ) a magician must lower the resistance ( basic magick resistance or bmr ) to '' 0 '' in order to learn or cast a spell or enchant an item spells and materials have a bmr varies from 1 to 10 ; the highest bmrs make spells and materials more durable and therefore more difficult to learn or enchant the magick user will then enchant the 22 corresponding materials to the sign of the object and end the spell during the 30 days covered by the sign of the object , without anyone coming to interrupt this period of time the focus is essential to the magick user who wants to practice their art in good condition the demons of c & s have clear origins in mythology , occultism , and prior works of fantasy fiction imps are dark faeries , lesser demons , or magic users ' magical familiars , drawn from germanic folklore the game was now very orientated more toward fantasy and less near the historical realism and medieval european culture of the previous editions chivalry & sorcery ( 1977 ) chivalry & sorcery 2nd ed 2 ( 2003 ) - published by mystic station designs the game master 's toolkit vol the overriding theme of chivalry & sorcery settings is a world where magic is rare , and whose societies mimic real-world medieval europe

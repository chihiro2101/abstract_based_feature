first edition ( c & s1 ) the first edition of chivalry & sorcery , also called the red book was published by fantasy games unlimited in 1977 to reduce the printing cost , the fgu edition was printed by photo-reducing four pages onto each page of the rule book with the consequent loss of readability the rulebook not only contained rules for character creation ( including monster player characters ) , combat , and magic but also wargames rules for battles and sieges in addition to ideas taken from arthurian myth , the first edition also incorporated elements of j thus , c & s has less of a modern literary influence than d & d , dungeons & dragons was heavily influenced by 20th century fantasy literature both the game 's writers and most of its players had at least a passing familiarity with modern fantasy the original first edition of d & d 's deities and demigods mythological cyclopedia had unlicensed sections on h.p lovecraft 's cthulhu mythos cycle , fritz leiber 's lankmar series , and michael moorcock 's elric to allow campaigns set in their fictional worlds which was not only heavily influenced by tolkien but also other major fantasy authors such as robert e unlike d & d , non-human races are not restricted with a level cap once the race is specified , the player randomly draws '' primary '' characteristics , as well as size , weight and astral sign this is similar to dungeons & dragon 's six attributes , except the attribute of charisma is split into the two primary characteristics of appearance ( physical attractiveness ) and bardic voice ( oration and persuasiveness ) appearance is like advanced dungeons & dragons comeliness and bardic voice is like dungeons & dragons charisma the c & s version of charisma ( leadership ) is a derived secondary characteristic used for leading and inspiring retainers the secondary characteristics are derived from the primary characteristics and modified by the character 's size and weight the alignment of a character in chivalry & sorcery is either selected or rolled randomly on a d20 ( dice ) table and is scored from 1 to 20 this corresponds to lawful ( 1-7 ) , neutral ( 8-15 ) or chaotic ( 16â€“20 ) , with the number indicating a named level within that alignment ( for examples : 1 is lawful-saintly , 11 is neutral-worldly , and 20 is chaotic-diabolical ) chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc a neutral character would be self-serving and secular , obeying the rules as they see fit a chaotic character considers religion and moral principles as secondary or even devoid of any significance and will deliver the worst abuses that morality condemns for example , the sign leo is a good sign for warriors while the sign scorpio is a good sign for magicians chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc in c & s social status is very important and a random drawing determines the origin and social rank of the character finally , taking into account the characteristics , the astral sign , social background , race and natural inclination , the player decides what role the character will follow backhaus , wilf and simbalist , edward chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc for this reason , it is common to have a few alternate or backup characters ready , as creating a character is not a matter of a few dice and a few minutes combat in c & s attempts to be more realistic than the abstract systems of games such as d & d , though it still has the armour class and hit table concepts c & s introduced concepts such as fatigue being separate from damage and the '' bash '' ( a strong blow that can cause the target to be knocked to the ground ) it was created by wilf backhaus and inspired mainly by real magic by isaac bonewits a magician 's capability is defined by their concentration level ( which depends on their characteristics , bonus astral and experience ) which determines their magick level ( mkl , the ' k ' of magick is emphasized by c & s ) the mkl determines what level of spells will be available ( a new level of spells are available both mkl ) the highest mkl a magician can have is 22 ( as the 22 '' major arcana '' cards of occult tarot ) this ambiguity persisted until the third edition of the game ) all sorts of bm are the result of mixing of at least one spell of creation / manipulation ( and up to three ) and an element a magician who wants to create and launch a fireball at the same time uses a spell with the formula detach create fire when a player decides to play a magick user , the class to which the character will belong must be determined randomly ( or selected if the game master agrees ) the natural magick users have inborn powers the medium magick user draws knowledge and powers from spirit-guides and ghosts finally , the solitary hex master uses their knowledge of black magic and demons to fight evil , which requires a lawful alignment the major arcana are closer to traditional magicians found in fantasy fiction or other rpgs the conjurer specializes in potions that they prepare in their magic cauldron all their life they search for the secret of life and death which will create a being of flesh animated entirely at their command , in the style of frankenstein 's monster the necromancer often plays the villain in the adventures of c & s and is a formidable opponent the last class of the major arcana is thaumaturgist , who produces powders and perfumes and is the undisputed master of illusions they often work with other magicians , especially the artificiers power word mystics are the masters of words and commands a good example of this type of character would be ged ( sparrowhawk ) , in ursula k the magic system itself is based on the premise that the world is resistant to magic ( much like in lion rampant 's ars magica and white wolf 's mage : the ascension ) spells and materials have a bmr varies from 1 to 10 ; the highest bmrs make spells and materials more durable and therefore more difficult to learn or enchant in practice , to cast a spell , the caster must first pass the casting phase ( make the spell happen or come into being ) this three-stage system makes magic less automatic , more random , but not less dangerous because the effects of high level spells are often terribly fatal the process of making magic items was particularly detailed and far more advanced than other games of the moment for examples , the medium has a crystal ball , the artificer blacksmith has a hammer and anvil , the conjuror has a cauldron , etc tolkien , giving a strong sense of realism , much stronger than in most other games in the same period this flexible and efficient system is a decisive contribution to c & s , and led to both a simpler single resolution system for all aspects of the game and a modernistic game with an operating system talent gamemaster 's companion ( 2000 ) chivalry & sorcery essence

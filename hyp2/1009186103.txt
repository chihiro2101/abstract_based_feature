first edition ( c & s1 ) the first edition of chivalry & sorcery , also called the red book was published by fantasy games unlimited in 1977 to reduce the printing cost , the fgu edition was printed by photo-reducing four pages onto each page of the rule book with the consequent loss of readability the rulebook not only contained rules for character creation ( including monster player characters ) , combat , and magic but also wargames rules for battles and sieges in addition to ideas taken from arthurian myth , the first edition also incorporated elements of j these references have disappeared in subsequent editions for reasons of copyright thus , c & s has less of a modern literary influence than d & d , dungeons & dragons was heavily influenced by 20th century fantasy literature both the game 's writers and most of its players had at least a passing familiarity with modern fantasy the conceptualization of the races of elves , dwarves , halflings , orcs , and golblins were taken from j.r.r the original first edition of d & d 's deities and demigods mythological cyclopedia had unlicensed sections on h.p these show the influence of the literary works of j unlike d & d , non-human races are not restricted with a level cap the primary characteristics are seven in number : dexterity , strength , constitution , intelligence , wisdom , appearance , and bardic voice appearance is like advanced dungeons & dragons comeliness and bardic voice is like dungeons & dragons charisma the c & s version of charisma ( leadership ) is a derived secondary characteristic used for leading and inspiring retainers the alignment of a character in chivalry & sorcery is either selected or rolled randomly on a d20 ( dice ) table and is scored from 1 to 20 the system is heavily influenced by the values and teachings of the christian religion , 2000 ) , pp.23-24 a lawful character would be very respectful of the sacred texts and behave like an honest citizen of good morals a lawful-saintly character sees everything in a fanatical dualism in cosmology , in which there is absolute good and absolute evil a neutral character would be self-serving and secular , obeying the rules as they see fit for example , the sign leo is a good sign for warriors while the sign scorpio is a good sign for magicians a character can also have one or more phobias or a mental illness , backhaus , wilf and simbalist , edward chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc , 2000 ) , pp.28-29 which allows the player to give a little more depth to the character in c & s social status is very important and a random drawing determines the origin and social rank of the character depending on social background , fighters range from the peasant soldier , through the belted knight , to the members of religious fighting orders ( fighters who have taken monastic vows ) clerics are also present , but are almost exclusively of a monotheistic faith with a christian-like hierarchy ( as the game was intended as a simulation of an essentially medieval christian europe ) chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc , 2000 ) , pp.166-167 they can be priests ( ordained clergy who can ask for divine interventions or cast miracles ) , monastics ( monks who are trained in a craft or trade and can make healing potions ) , they differ from monks in dungeons & dragons , which are based on shaolin monks from chinese martial arts movies backhaus , wilf and simbalist , edward for this reason , it is common to have a few alternate or backup characters ready , as creating a character is not a matter of a few dice and a few minutes c & s introduced concepts such as fatigue being separate from damage and the '' bash '' ( a strong blow that can cause the target to be knocked to the ground ) it was created by wilf backhaus and inspired mainly by real magic by isaac bonewits the mkl determines what level of spells will be available ( a new level of spells are available both mkl ) this ambiguity persisted until the third edition of the game thus creating a fireball requires the following formula : create fire there are 21 classes of magick users are available , divided into four main categories : magicians nature , arcana minor arcana major and mystics the drug trance magick user learn and cast spells after entering into an altered state of consciousness through drugs they prepare the jewelsmith artificer manufactures protective amulets and rings enchanted with powers they are similar to the elven smiths of eregion who were manipulated by sauron to make the three ( elvish ) , seven ( dwarvish ) , and nine ( mannish ) rings of power in j.r.r the last category is the minor arcana 's stone ( hex masters ) which itself comprises several types of magicians finally , the solitary hex master uses their knowledge of black magic and demons to fight evil , which requires a lawful alignment the major arcana are closer to traditional magicians found in fantasy fiction or other rpgs the enchanter hides their spells in songs and tunes and often takes the disguise of a minstrel who goes from castle to castle the necromancer animates and commands the undead all their life they search for the secret of life and death which will create a being of flesh animated entirely at their command , in the style of frankenstein 's monster when the reach a high enough mkl , they may make the rings of power and one ring that allows great power , as did sauron of mordor their knowledge is the most hermetic and difficult to teach , which may explain why this magick users class is very uncommon in c & s campaigns a magician must lower the resistance ( basic magick resistance or bmr ) to '' 0 '' in order to learn or cast a spell or enchant an item spells and materials have a bmr varies from 1 to 10 ; the highest bmrs make spells and materials more durable and therefore more difficult to learn or enchant the time spent on these purely magical activities is going to bring in experience , although it can also be earned on an adventure or expedition from killing monsters and finding treasure this three-stage system makes magic less automatic , more random , but not less dangerous because the effects of high level spells are often terribly fatal the process of making magic items was particularly detailed and far more advanced than other games of the moment often , the mage will be on a mission by their guild , which provides the game master opportunities for scenarios this system of skills ( very popular in the roleplaying of the vintage , including in particular chaosium 's ) diversifies the characters away from rigid traditional stereotypes '' probably the best feature of these rules is their attention to detail the game was now very orientated more toward fantasy and less near the historical realism and medieval european culture of the previous editions tannoth the

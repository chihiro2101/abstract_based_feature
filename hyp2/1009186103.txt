the first edition of chivalry & sorcery , also called the red book was published by fantasy games unlimited in 1977 the rulebook not only contained rules for character creation ( including monster player characters ) , combat , and magic but also wargames rules for battles and sieges in addition to ideas taken from arthurian myth , the first edition also incorporated elements of j thus , c & s has less of a modern literary influence than d & d , dungeons & dragons was heavily influenced by 20th century fantasy literature early editions of dungeons & dragons even had a reading list in the back with lists of authors and their works to expand upon that knowledge the alignment system ( law vs chaos ) was greatly influenced by moorcock 's eternal champion cycle the hyperbolic names for the magical system 's spells were influenced by jack vance 's dying earth stories ; the '' excellent prismatic sphere '' spell was completely lifted from the source material creating a character begins with the random selection of their race tolkien as the player may choose from among a human , elf , the elves , especially the '' calaquendi '' are by far the most powerful race in c & s1 as they are both fighters and magick users unlike d & d , non-human races are not restricted with a level cap once the race is specified , the player randomly draws '' primary '' characteristics , as well as size , weight and astral sign the primary characteristics are seven in number : dexterity , strength , constitution , intelligence , wisdom , appearance , and bardic voice the secondary characteristics are derived from the primary characteristics and modified by the character 's size and weight the alignment of a character in chivalry & sorcery is either selected or rolled randomly on a d20 ( dice ) table and is scored from 1 to 20 chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc , 2000 ) , pp.23-24 a lawful character would be very respectful of the sacred texts and behave like an honest citizen of good morals a character can also have one or more phobias or a mental illness , backhaus , wilf and simbalist , edward chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc finally , taking into account the characteristics , the astral sign , social background , race and natural inclination , the player decides what role the character will follow clerics are also present , but are almost exclusively of a monotheistic faith with a christian-like hierarchy ( as the game was intended as a simulation of an essentially medieval christian europe ) clerics can raise their social level through advancing up the church 's hierarchy to become lords spiritual ( like bishops , abbots , knight-commanders , or even the pope ) chivalry & sorcery red book ( updated 1st edition ) , ( gamestuff inc combat in c & s attempts to be more realistic than the abstract systems of games such as d & d , though it still has the armour class and hit table concepts c & s introduced concepts such as fatigue being separate from damage and the '' bash '' ( a strong blow that can cause the target to be knocked to the ground ) the rules of magic , being scattered over several chapters of the rule book , made it difficult to follow in practice , pmf determines the scope and duration of spells and the number of volumes of materials used by the magick user ( see below on magic basic ) this aspect of magic is questionable because the power of a spell will depend in some cases the level of the spell ( spells the highest levels being most powerful ) but for basic magic spells will no longer depend on the level of the spell but the magician pmf is to say its power this ambiguity persisted until the third edition of the game a magician who wants to create and launch a fireball at the same time uses a spell with the formula detach create fire an average man has 30 body points and an athletic one rarely exceeds 50 points in contrast , in ad & d the fireball spell is unlikely to kill a character of the same average level as the caster when a player decides to play a magick user , the class to which the character will belong must be determined randomly ( or selected if the game master agrees ) primitive talent magick users make their magic instinctively and are unable to learn spells from a book or to enchant magic items the drug trance magick user learn and cast spells after entering into an altered state of consciousness through drugs they prepare the dance & chant magick user draws power from totem animal spirits the medium magick user draws knowledge and powers from spirit-guides and ghosts they are similar to the elven smiths of eregion who were manipulated by sauron to make the three ( elvish ) , seven ( dwarvish ) , and nine ( mannish ) rings of power in j.r.r the last category is the minor arcana 's stone ( hex masters ) which itself comprises several types of magicians the major arcana are closer to traditional magicians found in fantasy fiction or other rpgs the conjurer specializes in potions that they prepare in their magic cauldron the enchanter hides their spells in songs and tunes and often takes the disguise of a minstrel who goes from castle to castle all their life they search for the secret of life and death which will create a being of flesh animated entirely at their command , in the style of frankenstein 's monster the necromancer often plays the villain in the adventures of c & s and is a formidable opponent le guin 's earthsea saga finally the mystic square mystics , perhaps the most mysterious of all magicians , use numbers and numerology to perform magic the magic system itself is based on the premise that the world is resistant to magic ( much like in lion rampant 's ars magica and white wolf 's mage : the ascension ) a magician must lower the resistance ( basic magick resistance or bmr ) to '' 0 '' in order to learn or cast a spell or enchant an item a magician will then study so they can learn to cast their spells or make it easier to enchant materials in practice , to cast a spell , the caster must first pass the casting phase ( make the spell happen or come into being ) the effectiveness of the spell depends on the caster 's experience and the size of its target finally , if the spell is an illusion or charm , the target is allowed an attribute-based saving throw to resist its effects , using either intelligence ( for illusions ) or wisdom ( for command or charm ) this three-stage system makes magic less automatic , more random , but not less dangerous because the effects of high level spells are often terribly fatal the magick user will then enchant the 22 corresponding materials to the sign of the object and end the spell during the 30 days covered by the sign of the object , without anyone coming to interrupt this period of time these objects are much longer and difficult to manufacture , but contain more spells , more loads and feature a power recharge allowing them to return every day some of the loads focus : these are enchanted like magical items of power , but each class of magick user produces a type of focus of its own it will store a huge number of spells in and they can use their focus for their personal magic defense one of the most interesting details of the game is an opportunity for a magick user to be part of a guild or society , more or less secret , including members of their class , and sometimes other classes of magicians pursuing the same ideals and animated by the same designs '' rolston warns that even the

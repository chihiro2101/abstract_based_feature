aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun the second process , the cno cycle , which was also considered by carl friedrich von weizsäcker in 1938 , is more important in more massive main-sequence stars hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass this review paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the elements ; but it did not itself enlarge hoyle 's 1954 picture for the origin of primary nuclei as much as many assumed , except in the understanding of nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron by neutron capture clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the s-process in 1961 and of the r-process in 1965 , as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968 , and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements hydrogen fusion ( nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus ) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main sequence stars it is also called '' hydrogen burning '' , which should not be confused with the chemical hydrogen combustion in an oxidizing atmosphere there are two predominant processes by which stellar hydrogen fusion occurs : proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen ( cno ) cycle the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass for stars above 35 % of the sun 's mass , the energy flux toward the surface is sufficiently low and energy transfer from the core region remains by radiative heat transfer , rather than by convective heat transfer the difference in energy production of this cycle , compared to the proton–proton chain reaction , is accounted for by the energy lost through neutrino emission about 90 % of the cno cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15 % of the star 's mass , hence it is strongly concentrated at the core main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion , but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion

aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun a clear physical description of the proton–proton chain and of the cno cycle appears in a 1968 textbook hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass hydrogen fusion ( nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus ) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main sequence stars in the cores of lower-mass main-sequence stars such as the sun , the dominant energy production process is the proton–proton chain reaction this creates a helium-4 nucleus through a sequence of reactions that begin with the fusion of two protons to form a deuterium nucleus ( one proton plus one neutron ) along with an ejected positron and neutrino the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass the cno cycle is very temperature sensitive , a 10 % rise of temperature would produce a 350 % rise in energy production about 90 % of the cno cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15 % of the star 's mass , hence it is strongly concentrated at the core as a main sequence star ages , the core temperature will rise , resulting in a steadily increasing contribution from its cno cycle main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion , but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion helium fusion first begins when a star leaves the red giant branch after accumulating sufficient helium in its core to ignite it in stars around the mass of the sun , this begins at the tip of the red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core , and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core

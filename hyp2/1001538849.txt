aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars in the following decade the gamow factor was used by atkinson and houtermans and later by edward teller and gamow himself to derive the rate at which nuclear reactions would occur at the high temperatures believed to exist in stellar interiors the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass this review paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the elements ; but it did not itself enlarge hoyle 's 1954 picture for the origin of primary nuclei as much as many assumed , except in the understanding of nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron by neutron capture clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the s-process in 1961 and of the r-process in 1965 , as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968 , and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements hydrogen fusion ( nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus ) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main sequence stars there are two predominant processes by which stellar hydrogen fusion occurs : proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen ( cno ) cycle the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass in higher-mass stars , the dominant energy production process is the cno cycle , which is a catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries and in the end produces a helium nucleus as with the proton-proton chain the difference in energy production of this cycle , compared to the proton–proton chain reaction , is accounted for by the energy lost through neutrino emission the proton–proton chain reaction starts at temperatures about , making it the dominant fusion mechanism in smaller stars main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion , but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion in this way , the alpha process preferentially produces elements with even numbers of protons by the capture of helium nuclei

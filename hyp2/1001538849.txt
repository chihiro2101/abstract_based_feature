aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars this was a preliminary step toward the idea of stellar nucleosynthesis in 1939 , in a nobel lecture entitled '' energy production in stars '' , hans bethe analyzed the different possibilities for reactions by which hydrogen is fused into helium the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun bethe 's two papers did not address the creation of heavier nuclei , however that theory was begun by fred hoyle in 1946 with his argument that a collection of very hot nuclei would assemble thermodynamically into iron hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass in 1957 cameron presented his own independent approach to nucleosynthesis , informed by hoyle 's example , and introduced computers into time-dependent calculations of evolution of nuclear systems clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the s-process in 1961 and of the r-process in 1965 , as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968 , and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements hydrogen fusion ( nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus ) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main sequence stars it is also called '' hydrogen burning '' , which should not be confused with the chemical hydrogen combustion in an oxidizing atmosphere about 90 % of the cno cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15 % of the star 's mass , hence it is strongly concentrated at the core as a main sequence star ages , the core temperature will rise , resulting in a steadily increasing contribution from its cno cycle this can then form oxygen , neon , and heavier elements via the alpha process

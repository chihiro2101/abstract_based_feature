aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars this was a preliminary step toward the idea of stellar nucleosynthesis the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun the second process , the cno cycle , which was also considered by carl friedrich von weizsäcker in 1938 , is more important in more massive main-sequence stars hoyle followed that in 1954 with a paper describing how advanced fusion stages within massive stars would synthesize the elements from carbon to iron in mass hoyle 's theory was extended to other processes , beginning with the publication of the 1957 review paper '' synthesis of the elements in stars '' by burbidge , burbidge , fowler and hoyle , more commonly referred to as the b2fh paper clayton calculated the first time-dependent models of the s-process in 1961 and of the r-process in 1965 , as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements in 1968 , and discovered radiogenic chronologies for determining the age of the elements hydrogen fusion ( nuclear fusion of four protons to form a helium-4 nucleus ) is the dominant process that generates energy in the cores of main sequence stars there are two predominant processes by which stellar hydrogen fusion occurs : proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen ( cno ) cycle in the cores of lower-mass main-sequence stars such as the sun , the dominant energy production process is the proton–proton chain reaction in higher-mass stars , the dominant energy production process is the cno cycle , which is a catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries and in the end produces a helium nucleus as with the proton-proton chain helium fusion first begins when a star leaves the red giant branch after accumulating sufficient helium in its core to ignite it in stars around the mass of the sun , this begins at the tip of the red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core , and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core in this way , the alpha process preferentially produces elements with even numbers of protons by the capture of helium nuclei

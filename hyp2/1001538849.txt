aston and a preliminary suggestion by jean perrin , proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are produced in stars the first one , the proton-proton chain reaction , is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about the mass of the sun a clear physical description of the proton–proton chain and of the cno cycle appears in a 1968 textbook in the cores of lower-mass main-sequence stars such as the sun , the dominant energy production process is the proton–proton chain reaction in each complete fusion cycle , the proton–proton chain reaction releases about 26.2 & nbsp ; mev the proton–proton chain reaction cycle is relatively insensitive to temperature ; a 10 % rise of temperature would increase energy production by this method by 46 % , hence , this hydrogen fusion process can occur in up to a third of the star 's radius and occupy half the star 's mass in higher-mass stars , the dominant energy production process is the cno cycle , which is a catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries and in the end produces a helium nucleus as with the proton-proton chain about 90 % of the cno cycle energy generation occurs within the inner 15 % of the star 's mass , hence it is strongly concentrated at the core this results in such an intense outward energy flux that convective energy transfer become more important than does radiative transfer the proton–proton chain reaction starts at temperatures about , making it the dominant fusion mechanism in smaller stars main sequence stars accumulate helium in their cores as a result of hydrogen fusion , but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion helium fusion first begins when a star leaves the red giant branch after accumulating sufficient helium in its core to ignite it the most massive stars become supergiants when they leave the main sequence and quickly start helium fusion as they become red supergiants in this way , the alpha process preferentially produces elements with even numbers of protons by the capture of helium nuclei

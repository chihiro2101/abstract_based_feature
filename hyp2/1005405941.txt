complete with khaki shorts ; hawaiian shirt ; and ginger fake beard - performing a rather poor impersonation of david bellamy , with gardening-based puns and jokes lenny henry also performed a regular slot of newsflashes as trevor mcdoughnut - a rather poor impersonation of itn newsreader trevor mcdonald - in which he performed news-based puns and jokes , punctuated by buckets of water being thrown at him the series was also frequently visited by the phantom flan flinger , who would throw custard pies ( '' flans '' ) around the studio at all and sundry the first series was intended to be eleven episodes , purely acting as links between the usual staple fillers of old films and cartoons that atv would transmit on saturday mornings presented by chris tarrant and john asher from merely a desk in a continuity studio , the pair had to rely on ad-libs and jokes sent in by viewers within a few weeks , the show was moved to studio 3 at atv centre ( a studio usually reserved for amongst other programmes , the news magazine programme , atv today ) from which tiswas was produced for the majority of its run billed in tv times as '' today is saturday or the tis-was show '' , the title sequence features both '' today is saturday '' and the original '' tiswas '' chunky letters logo , shown over a background very similar to that of the golden shot the sequence featured clips from various films and disney cartoons , backed by a funky jazz number known as '' atomic butterfly '' ( which also seems to have been used for sports arena , an htv wales sports programme in the early 1970s ) chris tarrant and john asher retained their roles as the main presenters , although john would leave during this series producer peter harris left the show in the summer , to help produce fellow cult tv success the muppet show at atv 's london-orientated operation in elstree running from late 1976 to early 1977 , chris tarrant , peter tomlinson and trevor east were the main presenters the 2 april 1977 show was a landmark edition , as part of the programme was broadcast outside the midlands for the first time , on htv cymru wales and htv west , filling up their 'round-the-regions ' compilation of saturday morning programmes called ten on saturday this series , running from 10 september 1977 to may 1978 , marked an end to the provincial micro-budget shows of the previous series , as the initial edition of this series brought significant changes sally james was drafted in as the series ' first regular female presenter comedian jim davidson was intended to be a regular presenter but left after only a few editions , although he would return for cameo appearances as well as appearing in part on htv , anglia , border , granada and scottish television began to screen tiswas in its entirety child performer paul hardin increased his visits to the studios , and could well be considered as a series 5 team member , likewise sylveste mccoy ( who added an '' r '' to his first name later in his career ) who performed surreal comic interludes with an almost national audience , the show became inclusive of its increased viewership by making a bigger role out of specially invited viewer performances this was all born out of one feature of the sixth series - '' the bucket of water song '' , which was such a hit with the viewers that it evolved from an intended one-off to an almost regular part of tiswas in addition , the three video compilations that have been released for sale have been packaged around a seventh series theme , with the bulk of the clips also being from this age bob carolgees , lenny henry and john gorman also left after the final edition of series 7 the only regular tiswas presenter left was sally james , who stayed on for series 8 the last series of tiswas , beginning in september 1981 and ending in april 1982 , had its format heavily tinkered with by atv management it was not such a success , running for just one series , and is today chiefly remembered for the naked 'balloon dance ' performed by the greatest show on legs , including comedian malcolm hardee lenny henry appeared on the bbc 's it started with swap shop programme in 2006 , in which he spoke to noel edmonds about tiswas being the rival of swap shop during the entire era from the official press release : for one night only , itv1 brings you tiswas reunited , a one-off special reuniting the stars of the iconic groundbreaking children â€™ s show tiswas presenter/performer john gorman wrote the first three ( published in the autumn of 1979 , 1980 , 1981 ) , and ollie spencer the 1983 edition ( prepared in spring 1982 and published that autumn , featuring presenters and characters from the final 1981-82 series ) apart from the tiswas reunited dvd , released by itv dvd a week after transmission of the 2007 programme , the only other tiswas dvd available is the best of tiswas tiswas on paul morris ' satkids british film institute screen online listing for tiswas tv cream -

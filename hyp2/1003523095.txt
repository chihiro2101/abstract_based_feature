the hrt was originally conceived during the late 1970s and was set up after fbi director william h when webster reviewed the equipment used by the delta force and noticed there were no handcuffs , he inquired about it '' the hrt was originally to be an augmented swat and counter-terrorism team , capable of handling extraordinary hostage situations , large-scale counter-terrorist operations , situations involving nuclear or biological agents , or operations that local law enforcement or the regional fbi field office were not trained or equipped to handle upon completing its initial selection , the newly formed hrt began acquiring the equipment it considered necessary and upgrading training facilities at quantico one of its first projects was the construction of a '' shoot house '' , built entirely out of old tires , to allow the team to conduct live-fire training exercises the final touches were added to the facilities just before thanksgiving 1982 and , after a short holiday break , the team began its initial training program as part of their liaison duties , the men attended training exercises held by their assigned counter-terrorism unit and shared their experiences with the team the team returned to quantico for further training during the exercise , the hrt , a local swat team , and a united states department of energy nuclear emergency search team ( nest ) were tasked with assaulting a terrorist stronghold after the nest aircraft confirmed the location of the device , hrt operators infiltrated the terrorist safe house , secured the device , and managed to '' kill '' the terrorist involved in approximately 30 seconds the fbi 's senior leadership viewed the exercise as a complete success and granted final approval for the team to become fully operational other team members conducted helicopter operations and aerial insertion training with the us army 's task force 160 the hrt traveled to camp peary , near williamsburg , virginia , for counter-terrorism training courses to develop skills in breaching barricades , running roadblocks , and defensive driving the hrt became part of the critical incident response group upon its formation in 1994 , due to the need to consolidate the assets necessary to respond to a critical incident in one group since being added to critical incident response group , hrt has been used to conduct law enforcement operations and counterterrorism operations globally , often deploying with military special operations forces and intelligence units the hrt 's equipment and tactics are the most advanced of the fbi 's 56 swat teams and the 14 enhanced swat teams the hrt 's capabilities are distinguished because the hrt operators ( assault and sniper teams ) serve full-time and train daily while never advertised as such , hrt operators are fully trained commandos on par with department of defense special operations units the unit is able to operate in a variety of environments ( chemical , extreme cold , night and low-light , or rural environments ) even more advanced capabilities are possessed by the hrt , including high altitude low opening ( halo ) parachute operations , to name just one the hrt 's capabilities include advanced ground tactics , advanced maritime operations , and advanced tactical aviation operations the hrt , as a whole , possesses enhanced capabilities in the maritime domain , including advanced '' breaching '' capabilities ( the ability to circumvent locked doors aboard a ship ) and ship-boarding capabilities the hrt has vessels that are outfitted for maritime assaults , most of which have been upgraded since 2004 the hrt 's tactical aviation unit is staffed by fbi special agents unlike the military , whose aircraft are not always in the same location as their tactical operators , the hrt 's tactical helicopter unit is in the vicinity of hrt central command teams at home and abroad perform typical law enforcement activities , such as making arrests , processing scenes for evidence recovery , and testifying in court the hrt has provided traditional law enforcement during hurricane relief operations , tactical surveys , and special events such as the olympic games , presidential inaugurations , and political conventions after a six-month initial training period known as '' new operator training school '' ( '' nots '' ) , they are headquartered at the fbi academy in quantico , virginia both the selection course and nots are near mirror images of the 1st sfod-d ( '' delta force '' ) selection and training courses , with some minor adjustments for mission differences experienced hrt operators assigned to observer/sniper teams are sent to the united states marine corps scout sniper basic course maritime hrt operators are sent to a variety of maritime special operations courses , including phase ii of u.s three days are spent honing sniping or close quarters combat skills on the various training ranges available to the team during a routine week of training , it is not unusual for hrt operators to fire thousands of rounds to keep their shooting skills honed during the training cycle , the team refreshes its skills and takes part in exercises , attends other courses , or trains with foreign and domestic units the hrt is known to conduct joint training exercises and participate in exchange programs with some u.s military units such as the army 's combat applications group ( otherwise known as 1st sfod-d or delta force ) or the navy 's devgru ( seal team six ) the hrt routinely trains with other federal tactical teams such as the dea 's fast team , the united states border patrol 's bortac unit or the united states capitol police 's cert in addition to the hrt 's own facilities , the hrt routinely uses private and 1st sfod-d delta force shoot houses and ranges the hrt can also make use of aircraft belonging to the critical incident response group 's aviation special operations unit later appointed the special agent

public surveys are occasionally conducted to estimate the amount of crime that has not been reported to police however , they also have their limitations and generally do n't procure statistics useful for local crime prevention , often ignore offenses against children and do not count offenders brought before the criminal justice system two major methods for collecting crime data are law enforcement reports , which only reflect crimes that are reported , recorded , and not subsequently canceled ; and victim study ( victimization statistical surveys ) , which rely on individual memory and honesty victims let down by poor crime-recording because laws and practices vary between jurisdictions , comparing crime statistics between and even within countries can be difficult : typically only violent deaths ( homicide or manslaughter ) can reliably be compared , due to consistent and high reporting and relative clear definition has no comprehensive infrastructure to monitor crime trends and report the information to related parties such as law enforcement research using a series of victim surveys in 18 countries of the european union , funded by the european commission , has reported ( 2005 ) that the level of crime in europe has fallen back to the levels of 1990 , and notes that levels of common crime have shown declining trends in the u.s however , the european research suggests that '' increased use of crime prevention measures may indeed be the common factor behind the near universal decrease in overall levels of crime in the western world '' , since decreases have been most pronounced in property crime and less so , if at all , in contact crimes however , many jurisdictions accept the following : there must be a prima facie case that an offence has been committed before it is recorded where multiple offenders are involved in the same act of offending only one act is counted when counting offenses but each offender is counted when apprehended in these surveys it is the participant 's perception , or opinion , that a crime occurred , or even their understanding about what constitutes a crime that is being measured the international crime victims survey has been done in over 70 countries to date and has been a 'de facto ' standard for defining common crimes

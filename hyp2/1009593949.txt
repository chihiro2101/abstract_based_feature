chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare , much of it during the zhou dynasty , especially the warring states era war was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign ; however , questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible the success of a military campaign was sufficient proof that the campaign had been righteous though japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war , between the 5th and 7th centuries they drew heavily from chinese philosophy , and especially confucian views the india hindu epic , the mahabharata , offers the first written discussions of a '' just war '' ( dharma-yuddha or '' righteous war '' ) in it , one of five ruling brothers ( pandava ) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified the war in the mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the '' just cause '' for the war including last-minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war in sikhism , the term dharamyudh describes a war that is fought for just , righteous or religious reasons , especially in defence of one 's own beliefs it was aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the hellenic world where war was a last resort and required conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war and warfare to '' avoid becoming enslaved to others '' is justified as self-defense war was always potentially nefas ( '' wrong , forbidden '' ) , and risked religion in ancient rome harris , war and imperialism in republican rome , 327-70 b.c christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas christians and war : thomas aquinas refines the '' just war '' theory the just war theory , with some amendments , is still used by christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified saint augustine held that , while individuals should not resort immediately to violence , god has given the sword to government for good reason ( based upon romans 13:4 ) '' augustine : political and social philosophy , §3-c '' war and peace – the just war '' the just war theory by thomas aquinas has had a lasting impact on later generations of thinkers and was part of an emerging consensus in medieval europe on just war aquinas was a dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from aristotle , plato , saint augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the western canon in summa theologica aquinas asserted that it is not always a sin to wage war and set out criteria for a just war second , the war needs to be waged for just cause , on account of some wrong the attacked have committed it stated that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind the school 's adherents reasoned that war should be a last resort , and only then , when necessary to prevent an even greater evil diplomatic resolution is always preferable , even for the more powerful party , before a war is started if the people oppose a war , then it is illegitimate once war has begun , there remain moral limits to action it is obligatory to take advantage of all options for dialogue and negotiations before undertaking a war ; war is only legitimate as a last resort under this doctrine expansionist wars , wars of pillage , wars to convert infidels or pagans , and wars for glory are all inherently unjust at the british government 's request randall davidson , archbishop of canterbury , took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders , including some with whom he had differed in the past , to write a rebuttal of the germans ' contentions both german and british theologians based themselves on the just war theory , each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by their own side the possession of war potential does not justify the use of force for political or military objectives like most philosophy , it permits legitimate defense and measures to maintain peace while recognizing war as evil , the russian orthodox church does not prohibit her members from participating in hostilities if at stake is the security of their neighbors and the restoration of trampled justice . the just war tradition the just war theory by the medieval christian philosopher thomas aquinas was developed further by legal scholars in the context of international law this just war tradition was well established by the 19th century and found its practical application in the hague peace conferences and the founding of the league of nations in 1920 francisco de vitoria criticized the conquest of america by the kingdom of spain on the basis of just war theory with alberico gentili and hugo grotius just war theory was replaced by international law theory , codified as a set of rules , which today still encompass the points commonly debated , with some modifications norton & company ; 1999 the importance of the theory of just war faded with the revival of classical republicanism beginning with works of thomas hobbes the criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid in determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativism , one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the ethic of reciprocity , particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle which side initiated aggressions or had a grievance or any other commonly considered factor of jus ad bellum mattered not at all , he claimed ; if one side was being oppressed by the other , the war against the oppressor would always be , by definition , a defensive war anyway the just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can , in certain situations , be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young plainly , we can not have a genuine process of judging a just war within a system that represses the process of genuine justice ; proportionality : the anticipated benefits of waging a war must be proportionate to its expected evils or harms the acts of war should be directed towards enemy combatants , and not towards non-combatants caught in circumstances they did not create the prohibited acts include bombing civilian residential areas that include no legitimate military targets , committing acts of terrorism or reprisal against civilians or prisoners of war ( pows ) , and attacking neutral targets ; fair treatment of prisoners of war : enemy combatants who surrendered or who are captured no longer pose a threat pacifists extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to combatants , especially conscripts he was sentenced to death during world war i ( later commuted to 25 years hard labor ) for desertion and spreading propaganda military theory perpetual war philosophy of war use of force by states showing the catholic view in three points , including john paul ii 's position concerning war

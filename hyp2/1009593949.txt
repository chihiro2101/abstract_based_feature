chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare , much of it during the zhou dynasty , especially the warring states era war was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign ; however , questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible though japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war , between the 5th and 7th centuries they drew heavily from chinese philosophy , and especially confucian views the india hindu epic , the mahabharata , offers the first written discussions of a '' just war '' ( dharma-yuddha or '' righteous war '' ) the war in the mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the '' just cause '' for the war including last-minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war in sikhism , the term dharamyudh describes a war that is fought for just , righteous or religious reasons , especially in defence of one 's own beliefs aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war and warfare to '' avoid becoming enslaved to others '' is justified as self-defense 157-162 in ancient rome , a '' just cause '' for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion , or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty badian , roman imperialism in the late republic ( ithaca 1968 , 2nd ed a '' just war '' ( bellum iustum ) thus required a ritualized declaration by the fetial the quintessential explanation of just war theory in the ancient world is found in cicero 's de officiis , book 1 , sections 1.11.33–1.13.41 christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas christians and war : thomas aquinas refines the '' just war '' theory the just war theory , with some amendments , is still used by christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified war may be necessary and right , even though it may not be good in the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force , war may be the only way to restore justice saint augustine held that , while individuals should not resort immediately to violence , god has given the sword to government for good reason ( based upon romans 13:4 ) in contra faustum manichaeum book 22 sections 69–76 , augustine argues that christians , as part of a government , need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government augustine asserted that this was a personal , philosophical stance : '' what is here required is not a bodily action , but an inward disposition '' while not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just , augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work the city of god : but , say they , the wise man will wage just wars as if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars , if he remembers that he is a man ; for if they were not just he would not wage them , and would therefore be delivered from all wars '' augustine : political and social philosophy , §3-c '' war and peace – the just war '' aquinas was a dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from aristotle , plato , saint augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the western canon after its publication in the 12th century , the decretum gratiani had been republished with commentary from pope innocent iv and the dominican friar raymond of penafort in summa theologica aquinas asserted that it is not always a sin to wage war and set out criteria for a just war second , the war needs to be waged for just cause , on account of some wrong the attacked have committed aquinas came to the conclusion that a just war could be offensive and that injustice should not be tolerated so as to avoid war soldiers needed to avoid cruelty and a just war was limited by the conduct of just combatants aquinas argued that it was only in the pursuit of justice , that the good intention of a moral act could justify negative consequences , including the killing of the innocent during a war the school of salamanca expanded on thomism understanding of natural law and just war it stated that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind the school 's adherents reasoned that war should be a last resort , and only then , when necessary to prevent an even greater evil war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation : it must comply with a series of additional requirements : it is necessary that the response be commensurate with the evil ; use of more violence than is strictly necessary would constitute an unjust war governing authorities declare war , but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war once war has begun , there remain moral limits to action it is obligatory to take advantage of all options for dialogue and negotiations before undertaking a war ; war is only legitimate as a last resort in the early part of the first world war , a group of theologians in germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the german government both german and british theologians based themselves on the just war theory , each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by their own side the possession of war potential does not justify the use of force for political or military objectives the document offers criteria of distinguishing between an aggressive war , which is unacceptable , and a justified war , attributing the highest moral and sacred value of military acts of bravery to a true believer who participates in a “ justified ” war additionally , the document considers the just war criteria as developed in western christianity eligible for russian orthodoxy , so the “ justified war ” idea in western theology is applicable to the russian orthodox church too . the just war tradition the just war theory by the medieval christian philosopher thomas aquinas was developed further by legal scholars in the context of international law after the united states congress declared war on germany in 1917 , cardinal james gibbons issued a letter that all catholics were to support the war because '' our lord jesus christ does not stand for peace at any price '' armed conflicts such as the spanish civil war , world war ii and the cold war were , as a matter of course , judged according to the norms that aquinas ' just war theory had established by philosophers such as jacques maritain , elizabeth anscombe and john finnis the first work dedicated specifically to just war was de bellis justis of stanisław of skarbimierz ( 1360–1431 ) , who justified war by the kingdom of poland with teutonic knights francisco de vitoria criticized the conquest of america by the kingdom of spain on the basis of just war theory just war theorists combine a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary the criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid in determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativism , one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the ethic of reciprocity , particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle if one set of combatants promise to treat their enemies with a modicum of restraint and respect , then the hope is that other sets of combatants will do similarly in reciprocation ( a concept not unrelated to the considerations of game theory ) revolution and civil war – just war theory states that a just war must have just authority

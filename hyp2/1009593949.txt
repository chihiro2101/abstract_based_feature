war was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign ; however , questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible the success of a military campaign was sufficient proof that the campaign had been righteous though japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war , between the 5th and 7th centuries they drew heavily from chinese philosophy , and especially confucian views the india hindu epic , the mahabharata , offers the first written discussions of a '' just war '' ( dharma-yuddha or '' righteous war '' ) in it , one of five ruling brothers ( pandava ) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified the war in the mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the '' just cause '' for the war including last-minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war in sikhism , the term dharamyudh describes a war that is fought for just , righteous or religious reasons , especially in defence of one 's own beliefs it was aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the hellenic world where war was a last resort and required conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace as an exception to this , aristotelian just war theory permitted warfare to enslave what aristotle called '' natural slaves '' in aristotelian philosophy , the abolition of what he considers '' natural slavery '' would undermine civic freedom the quintessential explanation of just war theory in the ancient world is found in cicero 's de officiis , book 1 , sections 1.11.33–1.13.41 christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas christians and war : thomas aquinas refines the '' just war '' theory the just war theory , with some amendments , is still used by christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified in the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force , war may be the only way to restore justice in contra faustum manichaeum book 22 sections 69–76 , augustine argues that christians , as part of a government , need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government the sacred seat of virtue is the heart the just war theory by thomas aquinas has had a lasting impact on later generations of thinkers and was part of an emerging consensus in medieval europe on just war in the 13th century aquinas reflected in detail on peace and war aquinas was a dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from aristotle , plato , saint augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the western canon aquinas came to the conclusion that a just war could be offensive and that injustice should not be tolerated so as to avoid war nevertheless , aquinas argued that violence must only be used as a last resort aquinas argued that it was only in the pursuit of justice , that the good intention of a moral act could justify negative consequences , including the killing of the innocent during a war the school of salamanca expanded on thomism understanding of natural law and just war governing authorities declare war , but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war in the early part of the first world war , a group of theologians in germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the german government both german and british theologians based themselves on the just war theory , each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by their own side the possession of war potential does not justify the use of force for political or military objectives : the charter of the united nations intends to preserve future generations from war with a prohibition against force to resolve disputes between states the war and peace section in the basis of the social concept of the russian orthodox church is crucial for understanding the russian orthodox church ’ s attitude towards war additionally , the document considers the just war criteria as developed in western christianity eligible for russian orthodoxy , so the “ justified war ” idea in western theology is applicable to the russian orthodox church too while recognizing war as evil , the russian orthodox church does not prohibit her members from participating in hostilities if at stake is the security of their neighbors and the restoration of trampled justice the just war theory by the medieval christian philosopher thomas aquinas was developed further by legal scholars in the context of international law after the united states congress declared war on germany in 1917 , cardinal james gibbons issued a letter that all catholics were to support the war because '' our lord jesus christ does not stand for peace at any price '' armed conflicts such as the spanish civil war , world war ii and the cold war were , as a matter of course , judged according to the norms that aquinas ' just war theory had established by philosophers such as jacques maritain , elizabeth anscombe and john finnis the first work dedicated specifically to just war was de bellis justis of stanisław of skarbimierz ( 1360–1431 ) , who justified war by the kingdom of poland with teutonic knights with alberico gentili and hugo grotius just war theory was replaced by international law theory , codified as a set of rules , which today still encompass the points commonly debated , with some modifications norton & company ; 1999 the importance of the theory of just war faded with the revival of classical republicanism beginning with works of thomas hobbes although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativism , one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the ethic of reciprocity , particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle if one set of combatants promise to treat their enemies with a modicum of restraint and respect , then the hope is that other sets of combatants will do similarly in reciprocation ( a concept not unrelated to the considerations of game theory ) the just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts : when it is right to resort to armed force ( the concern of jus ad bellum ) and what is acceptable in using such force ( the concern of jus in bello ) in more recent years , a third category—jus post bellum—has been added , which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements , as well as the prosecution of war criminals soviet leader vladimir lenin defined only three types of just war , all of which share the central trait of being revolutionary in character in that manner , lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one—often summarized as '' who fired the first shot ? '' —precisely because it did n't take in consideration the class factor clearly , the application of the term '' defensive '' war , or war '' for the defense of the fatherland '' in such a case would be historically false , and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people , of philistines , of ignorant people , by the astute slaveowners '' anarcho-capitalism scholar murray rothbard stated : '' a just war exists when a people tries to ward off the threat of coercive domination by another people , or to overthrow an already-existing domination a war is unjust , on the other hand , when a people try to impose domination on another people or try to retain an already existing coercive rule over them ; right intention : force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose—correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention , while material gain or maintaining economies is not to the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government , this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war , in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of just war theory consequentialism – the moral theory most frequently summarized in the words '' the end justifies the means '' , which tends to support the just war theory ( unless the just war causes less beneficial means to become necessary , which further requires worst actions for self-defense with bad consequences ) '' the just war theory : a traditional catholic moral view '' , the tidings ( 2006 ) the rosicrucian philosophy in questions and answers – volume ii ( the philosophy of war , world war i reference , ed

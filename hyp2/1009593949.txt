a 2017 study found that the just war tradition can be traced as far back as to ancient egypt , '' demonstrating that just war thought developed beyond the boundaries of europe and existed many centuries earlier than the advent of christianity or even the emergence of greco-roman doctrine chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare , much of it during the zhou dynasty , especially the warring states era war was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign ; however , questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible though japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war , between the 5th and 7th centuries they drew heavily from chinese philosophy , and especially confucian views the india hindu epic , the mahabharata , offers the first written discussions of a '' just war '' ( dharma-yuddha or '' righteous war '' ) in it , one of five ruling brothers ( pandava ) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified the war in the mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the '' just cause '' for the war including last-minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war it was aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the hellenic world where war was a last resort and required conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace as an exception to this , aristotelian just war theory permitted warfare to enslave what aristotle called '' natural slaves '' 157-162 in ancient rome , a '' just cause '' for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion , or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty the quintessential explanation of just war theory in the ancient world is found in cicero 's de officiis , book 1 , sections 1.11.33–1.13.41 christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas war may be necessary and right , even though it may not be good augustine asserted that this was a personal , philosophical stance : '' what is here required is not a bodily action , but an inward disposition '' while not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just , augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work the city of god : but , say they , the wise man will wage just wars aquinas was a dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from aristotle , plato , saint augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the western canon aquinas ' views on war drew heavily on the decretum gratiani , a book the italian monk gratian had compiled with passages from the bible other significant influences on aquinas just war theory were alexander of hales and henry of segusio in summa theologica aquinas asserted that it is not always a sin to wage war and set out criteria for a just war nevertheless , aquinas argued that violence must only be used as a last resort the school of salamanca expanded on thomism understanding of natural law and just war diplomatic resolution is always preferable , even for the more powerful party , before a war is started preventive war against a tyrant who is about to attack for example , one may not attack innocents or kill hostages under this doctrine expansionist wars , wars of pillage , wars to convert infidels or pagans , and wars for glory are all inherently unjust in the early part of the first world war , a group of theologians in germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the german government both german and british theologians based themselves on the just war theory , each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by their own side '' davidson , randall thomas , baron davidson of lambeth ( 1848–1930 ) , archbishop of canterbury '' , oxford dictionary of national biography , oxford university press , 2011 it is important to remember that '' it is one thing to wage a war of self-defense ; it is quite another to seek to impose domination on another nation : therefore , engaging in a preventive war without clear proof that an attack is imminent can not fail to raise serious moral and juridical questions pope john paul ii in an address to a group of soldiers said the following : russian orthodox church and the just war the war and peace section in the basis of the social concept of the russian orthodox church is crucial for understanding the russian orthodox church ’ s attitude towards war additionally , the document considers the just war criteria as developed in western christianity eligible for russian orthodoxy , so the “ justified war ” idea in western theology is applicable to the russian orthodox church too text was copied from this source , which is available under a creative commons attribution 4.0 international license then war is considered to be necessary , though undesirable , but means also , it is stated to orthodoxy has had profound respect for soldiers who gave their lives to protect the life and security of their neighbors this just war tradition was well established by the 19th century and found its practical application in the hague peace conferences and the founding of the league of nations in 1920 the criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid in determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible the just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts : when it is right to resort to armed force ( the concern of jus ad bellum ) and what is acceptable in using such force ( the concern of jus in bello ) in more recent years , a third category—jus post bellum—has been added , which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements , as well as the prosecution of war criminals in simple terms : '' to the russian workers has fallen the honor and the good fortune of being the first to start the revolution—the great and only legitimate and just war , the war of the oppressed against the oppressors in that manner , lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one—often summarized as '' who fired the first shot ?

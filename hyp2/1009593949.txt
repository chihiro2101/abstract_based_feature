chinese philosophy produced a massive body of work on warfare , much of it during the zhou dynasty , especially the warring states era though japan did not develop its own doctrine of just war , between the 5th and 7th centuries they drew heavily from chinese philosophy , and especially confucian views the india hindu epic , the mahabharata , offers the first written discussions of a '' just war '' ( dharma-yuddha or '' righteous war '' ) in it , one of five ruling brothers ( pandava ) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified the war in the mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the '' just cause '' for the war including last-minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war it was aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the hellenic world where war was a last resort and required conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war and warfare to '' avoid becoming enslaved to others '' is justified as self-defense as an exception to this , aristotelian just war theory permitted warfare to enslave what aristotle called '' natural slaves '' according to the cambridge companion to aristotle 's politics the targets of this aggressive warfare were non-greeks , noting aristotle 's view that '' our poets say 'it is proper for greeks to rule non-greeks ' '' 157-162 in ancient rome , a '' just cause '' for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion , or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty war was always potentially nefas ( '' wrong , forbidden '' ) , and risked religion in ancient rome colish , the stoic tradition from antiquity to the early middle ages ( brill , 1980 ) , p the quintessential explanation of just war theory in the ancient world is found in cicero 's de officiis , book 1 , sections 1.11.33–1.13.41 christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas christians and war : thomas aquinas refines the '' just war '' theory the just war theory , with some amendments , is still used by christians today as a guide to whether or not a war can be justified in the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force , war may be the only way to restore justice in contra faustum manichaeum book 22 sections 69–76 , augustine argues that christians , as part of a government , need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government augustine asserted that this was a personal , philosophical stance : '' what is here required is not a bodily action , but an inward disposition as if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars , if he remembers that he is a man ; for if they were not just he would not wage them , and would therefore be delivered from all wars '' augustine : political and social philosophy , §3-c '' war and peace – the just war '' the just war theory by thomas aquinas has had a lasting impact on later generations of thinkers and was part of an emerging consensus in medieval europe on just war after its publication in the 12th century , the decretum gratiani had been republished with commentary from pope innocent iv and the dominican friar raymond of penafort according to aquinas , three requirements must be met : first , the war must be waged upon the command of a rightful sovereign second , the war needs to be waged for just cause , on account of some wrong the attacked have committed aquinas came to the conclusion that a just war could be offensive and that injustice should not be tolerated so as to avoid war diplomatic resolution is always preferable , even for the more powerful party , before a war is started war to punish a guilty enemy governing authorities declare war , but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war under this doctrine expansionist wars , wars of pillage , wars to convert infidels or pagans , and wars for glory are all inherently unjust at the british government 's request randall davidson , archbishop of canterbury , took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders , including some with whom he had differed in the past , to write a rebuttal of the germans ' contentions it is important to remember that '' it is one thing to wage a war of self-defense ; it is quite another to seek to impose domination on another nation the possession of war potential does not justify the use of force for political or military objectives like most philosophy , it permits legitimate defense and measures to maintain peace : therefore , engaging in a preventive war without clear proof that an attack is imminent can not fail to raise serious moral and juridical questions the war and peace section in the basis of the social concept of the russian orthodox church is crucial for understanding the russian orthodox church ’ s attitude towards war the document offers criteria of distinguishing between an aggressive war , which is unacceptable , and a justified war , attributing the highest moral and sacred value of military acts of bravery to a true believer who participates in a “ justified ” war . the just war tradition after the united states congress declared war on germany in 1917 , cardinal james gibbons issued a letter that all catholics were to support the war because '' our lord jesus christ does not stand for peace at any price '' armed conflicts such as the spanish civil war , world war ii and the cold war were , as a matter of course , judged according to the norms that aquinas ' just war theory had established by philosophers such as jacques maritain , elizabeth anscombe and john finnis the first work dedicated specifically to just war was de bellis justis of stanisław of skarbimierz ( 1360–1431 ) , who justified war by the kingdom of poland with teutonic knights francisco de vitoria criticized the conquest of america by the kingdom of spain on the basis of just war theory norton & company ; 1999 the importance of the theory of just war faded with the revival of classical republicanism beginning with works of thomas hobbes the criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid in determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativism , one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the ethic of reciprocity , particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle the just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts : when it is right to resort to armed force ( the concern of jus ad bellum ) and what is acceptable in using such force ( the concern of jus in bello ) in more recent years , a third category—jus post bellum—has been added , which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements , as well as the prosecution of war criminals the just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can , in certain situations , be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young just war theory has two sets of criteria , the first establishing jus ad bellum ( the right to go to war ) , and the second establishing jus in bello ( right conduct within war ) jus post bellum concerns justice after a war , including peace treaties , reconstruction , environmental remediation , war crimes trials , and war reparations military theory perpetual war philosophy of war use of force by states review of larry may , war crimes and just war , in democratiya 10 , ( an extended critique of just war theory

war was justified only as a last resort and only by the rightful sovereign ; however , questioning the decision of the emperor concerning the necessity of a military action was not permissible in it , one of five ruling brothers ( pandava ) asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified a long discussion then ensues between the siblings , establishing criteria like proportionality ( chariots can not attack cavalry , only other chariots ; no attacking people in distress ) , just means ( no poisoned or barbed arrows ) , just cause ( no attacking out of rage ) , and fair treatment of captives and the wounded the war in the mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the '' just cause '' for the war including last-minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war at the beginning of the war , there is the discussion of '' just conduct '' appropriate to the context of war in sikhism , the term dharamyudh describes a war that is fought for just , righteous or religious reasons , especially in defence of one 's own beliefs it was aristotle who first introduced the concept and terminology to the hellenic world where war was a last resort and required conduct that would not make impossible the restoration of peace as an exception to this , aristotelian just war theory permitted warfare to enslave what aristotle called '' natural slaves '' 157-162 in ancient rome , a '' just cause '' for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion , or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty a '' just war '' ( bellum iustum ) thus required a ritualized declaration by the fetial livy 1.32 ; 31.8.3 ; 36.3.9 more broadly , conventions of war and treaty-making were part of the ius gentium , the '' law of nations '' , the customary moral obligations regarded as innate and universal to human beings christian theory of the just war begins with augustine of hippo christians and war : augustine of hippo and the '' just war theory '' and thomas aquinas in the case of a country that has been invaded by an occupying force , war may be the only way to restore justice in contra faustum manichaeum book 22 sections 69–76 , augustine argues that christians , as part of a government , need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government '' nonetheless , he asserted , peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin as if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars , if he remembers that he is a man ; for if they were not just he would not wage them , and would therefore be delivered from all wars '' augustine : political and social philosophy , §3-c '' war and peace – the just war '' aquinas was a dominican friar and contemplated the teachings of the bible on peace and war in combination with ideas from aristotle , plato , saint augustine and other philosophers whose writings are part of the western canon aquinas ' views on war drew heavily on the decretum gratiani , a book the italian monk gratian had compiled with passages from the bible aquinas came to the conclusion that a just war could be offensive and that injustice should not be tolerated so as to avoid war soldiers needed to avoid cruelty and a just war was limited by the conduct of just combatants preventive war against a tyrant who is about to attack it is obligatory to take advantage of all options for dialogue and negotiations before undertaking a war ; war is only legitimate as a last resort in the early part of the first world war , a group of theologians in germany published a manifesto seeking to justify the actions of the german government at the british government 's request randall davidson , archbishop of canterbury , took the lead in collaborating with a large number of other religious leaders , including some with whom he had differed in the past , to write a rebuttal of the germans ' contentions both german and british theologians based themselves on the just war theory , each group seeking to prove that it applied to the war waged by their own side '' davidson , randall thomas , baron davidson of lambeth ( 1848–1930 ) , archbishop of canterbury '' , oxford dictionary of national biography , oxford university press , 2011 : therefore , engaging in a preventive war without clear proof that an attack is imminent can not fail to raise serious moral and juridical questions international legitimacy for the use of armed force , on the basis of rigorous assessment and with well-founded motivations , can only be given by the decision of a competent body that identifies specific situations as threats to peace and authorizes an intrusion into the sphere of autonomy usually reserved to a state pope john paul ii in an address to a group of soldiers said the following : additionally , the document considers the just war criteria as developed in western christianity eligible for russian orthodoxy , so the “ justified war ” idea in western theology is applicable to the russian orthodox church too cardinal cajetan , the jurist francisco de vitoria , the two jesuit priests luis de molina and francisco suárez , as well as the humanist hugo grotius and the lawyer luigi taparelli were most influential in the formation of a just war tradition after the united states congress declared war on germany in 1917 , cardinal james gibbons issued a letter that all catholics were to support the war because '' our lord jesus christ does not stand for peace at any price if by pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable , then , however well meant , it is mistaken , and it is hurtful to the life of our country '' armed conflicts such as the spanish civil war , world war ii and the cold war were , as a matter of course , judged according to the norms that aquinas ' just war theory had established by philosophers such as jacques maritain , elizabeth anscombe and john finnis the first work dedicated specifically to just war was de bellis justis of stanisław of skarbimierz ( 1360–1431 ) , who justified war by the kingdom of poland with teutonic knights with alberico gentili and hugo grotius just war theory was replaced by international law theory , codified as a set of rules , which today still encompass the points commonly debated , with some modifications just war theorists combine a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary just war theories are attempts '' to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces '' ; they attempt '' to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained , made more humane , and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting peace and justice '' although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is relativism , one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the ethic of reciprocity , particularly when it comes to in bello considerations of deportment during battle in more recent years , a third category—jus post bellum—has been added , which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements , as well as the prosecution of war criminals in that manner , lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one—often summarized as '' who fired the first shot ? '' —precisely because it did n't take in consideration the class factor which side initiated aggressions or had a grievance or any other commonly considered factor of jus ad bellum mattered not at all , he claimed ; if one side was being oppressed by the other , the war against the oppressor would always be , by definition , a defensive war anyway clearly , the application of the term '' defensive '' war , or war '' for the defense of the fatherland '' in such a case would be historically false , and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people , of philistines , of ignorant people , by the astute slaveowners precisely in this way are the present-day imperialist bourgeoisie deceiving the peoples by means of '' national ideology '' and the term '' defense of the fatherland '' in the present war between slave-owners for fortifying and strengthening slavery the just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can , in certain situations , be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young ; just cause : the reason for going to war needs to be just and can not , therefore , be solely for recapturing things taken or punishing people who have done wrong ; innocent life must be in imminent danger and intervention must be to protect life a contemporary view of just cause was expressed in 1993 when the us catholic conference said : '' force may be used only to correct a grave , public evil , i.e plainly , we can not have a genuine process of judging a just war within a system that represses the process of genuine justice once war has begun , just war theory ( jus in bello ) also directs how combatants are to act or should act : ; distinction : just war conduct should be governed by the principle of distinction revolution and civil war – just war theory states that a just war must have just authority review of larry may , war crimes and just war , in democratiya 10 , ( an extended critique of just war theory

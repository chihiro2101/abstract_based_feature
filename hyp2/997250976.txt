early colonial pennsylvania was a melting pot of various european religious influences , as william penn 's promise of religious tolerance opened the doors for many christian sects : the anabaptists , quakers , lutherans , german reformed , catholics , and all manner of religious mystics and free-thinkers although the majority of the pennsylvania dutch were protestant , their folk religious culture was deeply rooted in practices of the pre-reformation era , such as the veneration of the saints , the use of folk adaptations of liturgical blessings for everyday purposes , and the use of sacred objects and inscriptions for healing and protection these practices were brought to north america , and formed the basis of both oral and literary ritual traditions in pennsylvania the majority of the early ritual traditions of the pennsylvania dutch were rooted in german language , but the term '' powwow '' became widely used by speakers of english by the late 18th century the tradition is also called braucherei , or simply brauche , in pennsylvania dutch ; an adept is referred to as a '' powwower '' or braucher , though not all practitioners use the same terminology the bible is considered the most important book of the powwow , and no practitioner would work without their bible on hand the origins of a majority of the charms and spells utilized by the powwow are generally agreed upon to be remnants of medieval folk charms used by superstitious catholics against illness and witchery it is primarily understood by practitioners of the powwow tradition that powwow is an americanized version of english cunning craft : another characteristic practice of powwow magic is the himmelsbrief or '' heaven 's letter ''

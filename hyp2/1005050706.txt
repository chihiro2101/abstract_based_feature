dht research was originally motivated , in part , by peer-to-peer ( p2p ) systems such as freenet , gnutella , bittorrent and napster , which took advantage of resources distributed across the internet to provide a single useful application gnutella and similar networks moved to a query flooding model in essence , each search would result in a message being broadcast to every other machine in the network freenet is fully distributed , but employs a heuristic key-based routing in which each file is associated with a key , and files with similar keys tend to cluster on a similar set of nodes queries are likely to be routed through the network to such a cluster without needing to visit many peers one drawback is that , like freenet , dhts only directly support exact-match search , rather than keyword search , although freenet 's routing algorithm can be generalized to any key type where a closeness operation can be defined dhts characteristically emphasize the following properties : decentralized computing : the nodes collectively form the system without any central coordination some dht designs seek to be secure against malicious participants guido urdaneta , guillaume pierre and maarten van steen and to allow participants to remain anonymity , though this is less common than in many other peer-to-peer ( especially file sharing ) systems ; see anonymous p2p a keyspace partitioning scheme splits ownership of this keyspace among the participating nodes an overlay network then connects the nodes , allowing them to find the owner of any given key in the keyspace to index a file with given and in the dht , the sha-1 hash of is generated , producing a 160-bit key , and a message is sent to any node participating in the dht the message is forwarded from node to node through the overlay network until it reaches the single node responsible for key as specified by the keyspace partitioning the message will again be routed through the overlay to the node responsible for , which will reply with the stored the keyspace partitioning and overlay network components are described below with the goal of capturing the principal ideas common to most dhts ; many designs differ in the details the two algorithms appear to have been devised independently and simultaneously to solve the distributed hash table problem contrast this with a traditional hash table in which addition or removal of one bucket causes nearly the entire keyspace to be remapped each node is assigned a single key called its identifier ( id ) route length can be greater than diameter , since the greedy routing algorithm may not find shortest paths aside from routing , there exist many algorithms that exploit the structure of the overlay network for sending a message to all nodes , or a subset of nodes , in a dht a dht system that is carefully designed to have byzantine fault tolerance can defend against a security weakness , known as the sybil attack , which affects all current dht designs the key pair can be stored in more than one node corresponding to the key usually , rather than selecting just one node , real world dht algorithms select suitable nodes , with being an implementation-specific parameter of the dht apache cassandra baton overlay mainline dht â€“ standard dht used by bittorrent ( based on kademlia as provided by khashmir ) tribler wiki retrieved january 2010

dht research was originally motivated , in part , by peer-to-peer ( p2p ) systems such as freenet , gnutella , bittorrent and napster , which took advantage of resources distributed across the internet to provide a single useful application napster , the first large-scale p2p content delivery system , required a central index server : each node , upon joining , would send a list of locally held files to the server , which would perform searches and refer the queries to the nodes that held the results freenet is fully distributed , but employs a heuristic key-based routing in which each file is associated with a key , and files with similar keys tend to cluster on a similar set of nodes distributed hash tables use a more structured key-based routing in order to attain both the decentralization of freenet and gnutella , and the efficiency and guaranteed results of napster a project called the infrastructure for resilient internet systems ( iris ) was funded by a 12 million grant from the united states national science foundation in 2002 outside academia , dht technology has been adopted as a component of bittorrent and in the coral content distribution network dhts characteristically emphasize the following properties : decentralized computing : the nodes collectively form the system without any central coordination scalability : the system should function efficiently even with thousands or millions of nodes a key technique used to achieve these goals is that any one node needs to coordinate with only a few other nodes in the system – most commonly , o ( log n ) of the n participants ( see below ) – so that only a limited amount of work needs to be done for each change in membership and to allow participants to remain anonymity , though this is less common than in many other peer-to-peer ( especially file sharing ) systems ; see anonymous p2p an overlay network then connects the nodes , allowing them to find the owner of any given key in the keyspace the message is forwarded from node to node through the overlay network until it reaches the single node responsible for key as specified by the keyspace partitioning the keyspace partitioning and overlay network components are described below with the goal of capturing the principal ideas common to most dhts ; many designs differ in the details most dhts use some variant of consistent hashing or rendezvous hashing to map keys to nodes both consistent hashing and rendezvous hashing have the essential property that removal or addition of one node changes only the set of keys owned by the nodes with adjacent ids , and leaves all other nodes unaffected each node is assigned a single key called its identifier ( id ) for example , the chord dht uses consistent hashing , which treats nodes as points on a circle , and \delta ( k_1 , k_2 ) is the distance traveling clockwise around the circle from k_1 to k_2 thus , the circular keyspace is split into contiguous segments whose endpoints are the node identifiers aside from routing , there exist many algorithms that exploit the structure of the overlay network for sending a message to all nodes , or a subset of nodes , in a dht the new system , codenamed tonika or also known by its domain name as 5ttt , is based on an algorithm design known as '' electric routing '' and co-authored with the mathematician jonathan kelner in the real world the key could be a hash of a file 's content rather than a hash of a file 's name to provide content-addressable storage , so that renaming of the file does not prevent users from finding it usually , rather than selecting just one node , real world dht algorithms select suitable nodes , with being an implementation-specific parameter of the dht apache cassandra baton overlay mainline dht – standard dht used by bittorrent ( based on kademlia as provided by khashmir ) tribler wiki retrieved january 2010

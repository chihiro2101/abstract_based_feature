nothing is securely known of chariton beyond what he states in his novel , which introduces him as '' chariton of aphrodisias , secretary of the rhetor athenagoras '' the name '' chariton '' , which means '' man of graces '' , has been considered a pseudonym chosen to suit the romantic content of his writing , but both '' chariton '' and '' athenagoras '' occur as names on inscriptions from aphrodisias one recent study of chariton 's vocabulary favours a date in the late 1st century or early 2nd century ad '' who died in ad 62 ; if this is chariton 's novel , then a relatively early date would be indicated chariton 's novel exists in only one ( somewhat unreliable ) manuscript , from the 13th century she is the daughter of hermocrates , a hero of the peloponnesian war and the most important political figure of syracuse , thus setting the narrative in time and social milieu chaereas and callirhoe return in triumph to syracuse , where callirhoe offers prayers to aphrodite , who has guided the events of the narrative however , callirhoe 's expectation that her son will return to syracuse after being brought up as dionysius ' own has been connected to the fact that the historical dionysius i was succeeded in syracuse by his son , dionysius ii since hermocrates died in 407 bc and artaxerxes did not come to the throne until 404 bc , chariton is anachronism in having hermocrates alive during artaxerxes ' reign the hero chaereas is not a historical figure , although his name recalls chabrias , an athenian general who fought in an egyptian revolt against persia in about 360 bc

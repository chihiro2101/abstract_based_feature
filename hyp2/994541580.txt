he returned to the united states and was employed at the research laboratory of the western electric in 1915 he was in charge of radio receiver development for the bell system transatlantic radiotelephone tests for this he developed the hartley oscillator and also a neutralizing circuit to eliminate triode singing resulting from internal coupling in spite of his illness during most of the 1930s , hartley had formed a theoretical and experimental research group at bell laboratories starting in 1929 hartley , r.v.l , '' a wave mechanism of quantum phenomena '' ; physical review , volume 33 page 289 , 1929 ( abstract only ) hartley , r.v.l , '' report on recent research on nonlinear oscillations '' , technical physics in the ussr , leningrad , volume 2 , numbers 2-3 , 1935 , pp 81 – 134 , ( nasa translation doc ttf-12,678 ; november 1969 ) and in europe by balthasar van der pol , '' some general properties of magnetic amplifiers '' , proceedings of the ire , volume 39 , march 1951 , pp 242 – 251 manley j.m , '' some general properties of nonlinear elements – part i : general energy relations '' , proceedings of the ire , volume 44 , july 1956 , pp 904 – 913 rowe h.e , '' transmission of information '' , bell system technical journal , volume 7 , number 3 , pp , '' oscillations in systems with non-linear reactance '' , the bell system technical journal , volume 15 , number 3 , pp 424 – 440 , ( july 1936 ) , '' matter , a mode of motion '' , bell system technical journal , volume 29 , number 3 , pg 350 - 368 , ( july 1950 ) , '' new system of logarithmic units '' , journal of the acoustical society of america , volume 27 , issue 1 , pp 174 – 176 , ( 1955 ) hartley , r.v.l , '' a mechanistic theory of extra-atomic physics '' , philosophy of science , volume 26 , number 4 , pp 295 – 309 , ( october 1959 ) us patent 1,666,206 , modulation system , april 17 , 1928 , united states patent and trademark office , page images can be downloaded .

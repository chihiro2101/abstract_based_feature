gustave hermite and georges besançon , from france , were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits the first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in france by bureau coined the name '' radiosonde '' and flew the first instrument on january 7 , 1929 in addition , this nbs radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy then in 1939 , diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the “ remote weather station , ” which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations by 1940 , the nbs radiosonde system included a pressure drive , which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure although hundreds of radiosondes are launched worldwide each day year-round , fatalities attributed to radiosondes are rare as the balloon ascends through the atmosphere , the pressure decreases , causing the balloon to expand the modern radiosonde communicates via radio with a computer that stores all the variables in real time the first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a theodolite , and gave only a wind estimation by the position the national weather service launches radiosondes from 92 stations in north america and the pacific islands twice daily radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction

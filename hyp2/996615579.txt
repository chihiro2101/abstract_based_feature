the first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs , a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment in 1898 , léon teisserenc de bort organized at the observatoire de météorologie dynamique de trappes the first regular daily use of these balloons data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits the first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in france by working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy although modern remote sensing by satellites , aircraft and ground sensors is an increasing source of atmospheric data , none of these systems can match the vertical resolution or less ) and altitude coverage of radiosonde observations , so they remain essential to modern meteorology after bursting , a small parachute on the radiosonde 's support line carries it to earth modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction , such as a radio direction finder or gps sometimes radiosondes are deployed by being dropped from an aircraft instead of being carried aloft by a balloon most countries share data with the rest of the world through international agreements in the united states the national weather service is tasked with providing timely upper-air observations for use in weather forecasting , severe weather watches and warnings , and atmospheric research the national weather service launches radiosondes from 92 stations in north america and the pacific islands twice daily radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction

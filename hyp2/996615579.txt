the first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs , a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits the first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in france by bureau coined the name '' radiosonde '' and flew the first instrument on january 7 , 1929 working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude this became an important technique in the field , and vernov flew his radiosondes on land and sea over the next few years , measuring the radiation 's latitude dependence caused by the earth 's magnetic field in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy then in 1939 , diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the “ remote weather station , ” which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations by 1940 , the nbs radiosonde system included a pressure drive , which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure although modern remote sensing by satellites , aircraft and ground sensors is an increasing source of atmospheric data , none of these systems can match the vertical resolution or less ) and altitude coverage of radiosonde observations , so they remain essential to modern meteorology the first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a theodolite , and gave only a wind estimation by the position modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction , such as a radio direction finder or gps in the united states the national weather service is tasked with providing timely upper-air observations for use in weather forecasting , severe weather watches and warnings , and atmospheric research the national weather service launches radiosondes from 92 stations in north america and the pacific islands twice daily

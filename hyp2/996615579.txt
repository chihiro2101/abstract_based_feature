this proved to be difficult because the kites were linked to the ground and were very difficult to manoeuvre in gusty conditions data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits the first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in france by developed independently a year later , pavel molchanov flew a radiosonde on january 30 , 1930 working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude this became an important technique in the field , and vernov flew his radiosondes on land and sea over the next few years , measuring the radiation 's latitude dependence caused by the earth 's magnetic field in addition , this nbs radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy by 1940 , the nbs radiosonde system included a pressure drive , which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure due to this and other improvements in cost ( about 25 ) , weight ( > 1 kilogram ) , and accuracy , hundreds of thousands of nbs-style radiosondes were produced nationwide for research purposes , and the apparatus was officially adopted by the u.s the first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a theodolite , and gave only a wind estimation by the position modern radiosondes can use a variety of mechanisms for determining wind speed and direction , such as a radio direction finder or gps land-based rawinsode stations of the federal meteorological handbook 3 , titled rawinsonde and pibal observations , dated may 1997 radio stations and systems â€“ article 1.109 , definition : radiosonde

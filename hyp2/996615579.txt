gustave hermite and georges besançon , from france , were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits the first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in france by bureau coined the name '' radiosonde '' and flew the first instrument on january 7 , 1929 developed independently a year later , pavel molchanov flew a radiosonde on january 30 , 1930 working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude in addition , this nbs radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy then in 1939 , diamond and his colleagues developed a ground-based radiosonde called the “ remote weather station , ” which allowed them to automatically collect weather data in remote and inhospitable locations by 1940 , the nbs radiosonde system included a pressure drive , which measured temperature and humidity as functions of pressure as the balloon ascends through the atmosphere , the pressure decreases , causing the balloon to expand the first radiosondes were observed from the ground with a theodolite , and gave only a wind estimation by the position sometimes radiosondes are deployed by being dropped from an aircraft instead of being carried aloft by a balloon radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction

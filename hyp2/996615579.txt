the first flights of aerological instruments were done in the second half of the 19th century with kites and meteographs , a recording device measuring pressure and temperature that was recuperated after the experiment gustave hermite and georges besançon , from france , were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph in 1898 , léon teisserenc de bort organized at the observatoire de météorologie dynamique de trappes the first regular daily use of these balloons data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude , which varied with the season , and then stabilized above this altitude signal corps did the first primitive experiments with weather measurements from balloon , making use of the temperature dependence of radio circuits the first true radiosonde that sent precise encoded telemetry from weather sensors was invented in france by bureau coined the name '' radiosonde '' and flew the first instrument on january 7 , 1929 working with a modified molchanov sonde , sergey vernov was the first to use radiosondes to perform cosmic ray readings at high altitude bureau of standards to develop an official radiosonde for the navy to use the nbs gave the project to harry diamond , who had previously worked on radio navigation and invented a blind landing system for airplanes in addition , this nbs radiosonde was capable of measuring temperature and humidity at higher altitudes than conventional radiosondes at the time due to the use of electric sensors in 1938 , diamond developed the first ground receiver for the radiosonde , which prompted the first service use of the nbs radiosondes in the navy the first known example was the electrocution of a lineman in the united states who was attempting to free a radiosonde from high-tension power lines in 1943 nearly all routine radiosonde launches occur 45 minutes before the official observation time of 0000 utc and 1200 utc , so as to provide an instantaneous snapshot of the atmosphere radiosonde data is a crucially important component of numerical weather prediction

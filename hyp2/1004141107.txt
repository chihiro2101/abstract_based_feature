the theoretical frame at the heart of processual archaeology is cultural evolutionism this is because processual archaeologists adhere to leslie white 's theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic ( outside the body ) means of environmental adaptation for humans the result of this is that processual archaeologists propose that cultural change happens within a predictable framework and seek to understand it by the analysis of its components trigger , 1989:289 what this all means to processual archaeologists is that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary '' processes '' in cultural development , which will be adaptive relative to the environment and therefore not only understandable , but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood trigger , 1989:295 methodologically , the advocates of the new archaeology had to come up with ways of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion systems theory has proved to be a mixed bag for archaeology as a whole outlined three basic , primary processes through which a language comes to be spoken in a specific area : initial colonization , replacement and continuous development clarke 's paper would later be described as '' one of the seminal statements of the new archaeology , by one of its leading proponents '' in britain , if not elsewhere , by the archaeologists caroline malone and simon stoddart processualism 's development transformed archaeology , and is sometimes called the '' new archaeology '' with few notable exceptions such as boston university , universities in america classify archaeology as a sub-discipline of anthropology , while in europe it is thought to be a subject more like historical studies it is important to analyze which sciences are close kin because such analysis highlights the questions of what archaeology ought to study and in what ways archaeology , and in particular archaeology of the historical period , has sometimes been allied more with humanities disciplines such as classics clarke suggested that the new archaeology would face particular opposition from amateurs , historical archaeologists and practical excavators but argued that such individuals would still benefit from the theory 's adoption the goddess and the bull : catalhoyuk , an archaeological journey to the dawn of civilization ( 2005 ) for a detailed account of the debate between the processual and post-processual schools of archaeology .

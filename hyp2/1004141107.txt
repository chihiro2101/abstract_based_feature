the theoretical frame at the heart of processual archaeology is cultural evolutionism this is because processual archaeologists adhere to leslie white 's theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic ( outside the body ) means of environmental adaptation for humans white , 1959:8 in other words , they study cultural adaptation to environmental change rather than the bodily adaptation over generations , which is dealt with by evolutionary biologists the result of this is that processual archaeologists propose that cultural change happens within a predictable framework and seek to understand it by the analysis of its components trigger , 1989:289 what this all means to processual archaeologists is that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary '' processes '' in cultural development , which will be adaptive relative to the environment and therefore not only understandable , but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood trigger , 1989:295 methodologically , the advocates of the new archaeology had to come up with ways of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion there was such a dearth of work in this area that it led willey and phillips to state in 1958 , '' so little work has been done in american archaeology on the explanatory level that it is difficult to find a name for it '' during the late 1960s and into the 1970s , archaeologist kent flannery began championing the idea that systems theory could be used in archaeology to attack questions of culture from an unbiased perspective in 1973 , the processualist david clarke of cambridge university would publish an academic paper in antiquity claiming that as a discipline , archaeology had moved from its original '' noble innocence '' through to '' self-consciousness '' and then onto '' critical self-consciousness '' , a symptom of which was the development of the new archaeology clarke 's paper would later be described as '' one of the seminal statements of the new archaeology , by one of its leading proponents '' in britain , if not elsewhere , by the archaeologists caroline malone and simon stoddart processualism 's development transformed archaeology , and is sometimes called the '' new archaeology the question of where to put archaeology as a discipline , and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use , likely played no small part in the emergence of post-processualism in europe clarke suggested that the new archaeology would face particular opposition from amateurs , historical archaeologists and practical excavators but argued that such individuals would still benefit from the theory 's adoption the goddess and the bull : catalhoyuk , an archaeological journey to the dawn of civilization ( 2005 ) for a detailed account of the debate between the processual and post-processual schools of archaeology .

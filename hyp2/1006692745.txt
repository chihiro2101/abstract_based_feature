a typical supply chain begins with the ecological , biological , and political regulation of natural resources , followed by the human extraction of raw material , and includes several production links ( e.g many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain more recently , the loosely coupled , self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the extended enterprise , and the use of the term '' chain '' and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticised as '' harder to relate , so why do we call it a 'supply chain ' anyway ? , industry week , emphasis added , published 3 december 2012 , accessed 6 january 2021 a chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network a lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification , which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices it includes delivery and order fulfillment performance , production flexibility , warranty and returns processing costs , inventory and asset turns , and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain the global supply chain forum has introduced another supply chain model while each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers , the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain it was the first model to report that '' the optimal position of the supply chain delivery window , which is necessary to achieve supply chain resilience , is neither determined by penalty cost per time unit late nor by the penalty cost per time unit early but by their ratio has developed the jsi framework for integrated supply chain management in public health , which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains supply chains the term was used earlier by alizamir et al demand management using responsive pricing and product variety in the presence of supply chain disruptions : working paper , smu cox school of business in theory , a supply chain seeks to match demand with supply and do so with minimal inventory resilience in supply chains is defined as '' the capability of the firm to be alert to , adapt to , and quickly respond to changes brought by a supply chain disruption '' in the united states , several major regulations emerged in 2010 that have had a lasting impact on how global supply chains operate broadly , the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain , but the reverse is also true : the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it since the product design dictates multiple requirements on the supply chain , as mentioned previously , then once a product design is completed , it drives the structure of the supply chain , limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different ( and potentially more cost-effective ) supply-chain alternatives

a typical supply chain begins with the ecological , biological , and political regulation of natural resources , followed by the human extraction of raw material , and includes several production links ( e.g , component construction , assembly , and merging ) before moving on to several layers of storage facilities of ever-decreasing size and increasingly remote geographical locations , and finally reaching the consumer many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain , so why do we call it a 'supply chain ' anyway ? , industry week , emphasis added , published 3 december 2012 , accessed 6 january 2021 a chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network a lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification , which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices the scor ( supply-chain operations reference ) model , developed by a consortium of industry and the non-profit supply chain council ( now part of apics ) became the cross-industry de facto standard defining the scope of supply-chain management the global supply chain forum has introduced another supply chain model while each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers , the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain the risk-averse optimal position of the delivery window ( ra-opdw ) is another supply chain model '' the american productivity and quality center ( apqc ) process classification framework ( pcf ) sm is a high-level , industry-neutral enterprise process model that allows organizations to see their business processes from a cross-industry viewpoint the pcf was developed by apqc and its member organizations as an open standard to facilitate improvement through process management and benchmarking , regardless of industry , size , or geography has developed the jsi framework for integrated supply chain management in public health , which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains the basic idea behind scm is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market fluctuations and production capabilities if all relevant information is accessible to any relevant company , every company in the supply chain has the ability to help optimize the entire supply chain rather than to sub-optimize based on local optimization supply chain resilience is improved by inter-firm and inter-personal collaboration across the network , supporting faster adaptation to supply changes the product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly , including manufacturing , transportation , quality , quantity , production schedule , material selection , production technologies , production policies , regulations , and laws supply chain sustainability freight forwarder logistics supply chain attack

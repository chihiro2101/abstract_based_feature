a typical supply chain begins with the ecological , biological , and political regulation of natural resources , followed by the human extraction of raw material , and includes several production links ( e.g many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain more recently , the loosely coupled , self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the extended enterprise , and the use of the term '' chain '' and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticised as '' harder to relate , so why do we call it a 'supply chain ' anyway ? , industry week , emphasis added , published 3 december 2012 , accessed 6 january 2021 a chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network a lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification , which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices the scor ( supply-chain operations reference ) model , developed by a consortium of industry and the non-profit supply chain council ( now part of apics ) became the cross-industry de facto standard defining the scope of supply-chain management it includes delivery and order fulfillment performance , production flexibility , warranty and returns processing costs , inventory and asset turns , and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain the global supply chain forum has introduced another supply chain model while each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers , the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain the pcf organizes operating and management processes into 12 enterprise-level categories , including process groups , and over 1,000 processes and associated activities has developed the jsi framework for integrated supply chain management in public health , which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains in the 1980s , the term supply-chain management ( scm ) was developed to express the need to integrate the key business processes , from end user through original suppliers the basic idea behind scm is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market fluctuations and production capabilities in theory , a supply chain seeks to match demand with supply and do so with minimal inventory the product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly , including manufacturing , transportation , quality , quantity , production schedule , material selection , production technologies , production policies , regulations , and laws broadly , the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain , but the reverse is also true : the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it since the product design dictates multiple requirements on the supply chain , as mentioned previously , then once a product design is completed , it drives the structure of the supply chain , limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different ( and potentially more cost-effective ) supply-chain alternatives

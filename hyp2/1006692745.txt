a typical supply chain begins with the ecological , biological , and political regulation of natural resources , followed by the human extraction of raw material , and includes several production links ( e.g many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain are therefore between different companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain , so why do we call it a 'supply chain ' anyway ? , industry week , emphasis added , published 3 december 2012 , accessed 6 january 2021 a chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network a lack of transparency in the supply chain is known as mystification , which bars consumers from the knowledge of where their purchases originated and can enable socially irresponsible practices the scor ( supply-chain operations reference ) model , developed by a consortium of industry and the non-profit supply chain council ( now part of apics ) became the cross-industry de facto standard defining the scope of supply-chain management it includes delivery and order fulfillment performance , production flexibility , warranty and returns processing costs , inventory and asset turns , and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain the global supply chain forum has introduced another supply chain model while each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers , the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain it was the first model to report that '' the optimal position of the supply chain delivery window , which is necessary to achieve supply chain resilience , is neither determined by penalty cost per time unit late nor by the penalty cost per time unit early but by their ratio has developed the jsi framework for integrated supply chain management in public health , which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains in the 1980s , the term supply-chain management ( scm ) was developed to express the need to integrate the key business processes , from end user through original suppliers in theory , a supply chain seeks to match demand with supply and do so with minimal inventory resilience in supply chains is defined as '' the capability of the firm to be alert to , adapt to , and quickly respond to changes brought by a supply chain disruption '' they also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if the supply can not be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility the drivers for this change include concerns about food safety , child labor and environmental sustainability as well as a desire to increase productivity and improve crop quality but product design affects not only demand generation but also manufacturing processes , cost , quality , and lead time broadly , the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain , but the reverse is also true : the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it

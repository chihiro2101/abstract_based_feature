the spellings '' hill fort '' , '' hill-fort '' and '' hillfort '' are all used in the archaeological literature they all refer to an elevated site with one or more ramparts made of earth , stone and/or wood , with an external ditch many small early hillforts were abandoned , with the larger ones being redeveloped at a later date similar but smaller and less defendable earthworks are found on the sides of hills they are most common during later periods : urnfield culture and atlantic bronze age ( c 1300 bc – 750 bc ) bronze age hallstatt culture ( c 1200 bc – 500 bc ) late bronze age to early iron age la tène culture ( c 600 bc – 50 ad ) late iron age prehistoric europe saw a growing population it has been estimated that in about 5000 & nbsp ; bc during the neolithic between 2 & nbsp ; million and 5 & nbsp ; million lived in europe ; in the late iron age it had an estimated population of around 15 to 30 & nbsp ; million outside greece and italy , which were more densely populated , the vast majority of settlements in the iron age were small , with perhaps no more than 50 & nbsp ; inhabitants with the emergence of oppida in the late iron age , settlements could reach as large as 10,000 & nbsp ; inhabitants during the hallstatt & nbsp ; c period , hillforts became the dominant settlement type in the west of hungary julius caesar described the large late iron age hillforts he encountered during his campaigns in gaul as oppida for example , solsbury hill was sacked and deserted during the belgae invasions of southern britain in the 1st century bc excavations at hillforts in the first half of the 20th & nbsp ; century focussed on the defenses , based on the assumption that hillforts were primarily developed for military purposes michael avery has stated the traditional view of hillforts by saying , '' the ultimate defensive weapon of european prehistory was the hillfort of the first millennium b.c beyond the simple definition of hillfort , there is a wide variation in types and periods from the bronze age to the middle ages here are some considerations of general appearance and topology , which can be assessed without archaeological excavation : location hilltop contour : the classic hillfort ; an inland location with a hilltop defensive position surrounded by artificial ramparts or steep natural slopes on all sides inland promontory : an inland defensive position on a ridge or spur with steep slopes on 2 or 3 sides , and artificial ramparts on the other level approach they would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction '' hillforts in britain are known from the bronze age , but the great period of hillfort construction was during the iron age , between 700 bc and the roman conquest of britain in 43 ad where roman influence was less strong , such as uninvaded ireland and unsubdued northern scotland , hillforts were still built and used for several more centuries there are over 2,000 iron age hillforts known in britain of which nearly 600 are in wales similarly the hillfort at old oswestry was incorporated into the early medieval wat 's dyke in galicia , asturias , cantabria , basque country , province of ávila and northern portugal a castro is a fortified pre-roman iron age village , usually located on a hill or some naturally easy defendable place many castros were already established during the atlantic bronze age period , pre-dating hallstatt culture many of the megaliths from the bronze age such as menhirs and dolmens , which are frequently located near the castros , also pre-date the celts in portugal , asturias and galicia as well as in atlantic france , britain and ireland the estonian word for hillfort is linnamägi ( plural linnamäed ) , meaning hillfort or hillburgh although some of them were probably used only during times of crisis and stood empty in peacetime ( for example soontagana in koonga parish , pärnu county ) lithuania has hillforts dating from the bronze age in the 1st millennium bc in scandinavia and northern russia , hillforts are fortifications from the iron age which may have had several functions

the pentium overdrive is a heavily modified , 3.3 volt pentium p54 core manufactured on 0.6 micrometer technology intel announces first pentium ( tm ) overdrive ( tm ) processor , press release , google groups , february , 1995 as the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width , per-clock performance was much lower than that of a 'regular ' pentium , though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the pentium 's architectural improvements , such as the much improved fpu the much faster 83 & nbsp ; mhz version , which supported both 25 ( 63 & nbsp ; mhz effective ) and 33 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems , launched much later the same year on october , and was very expensive at 299 compared to other upgrade alternatives , such as those based on am5x86 and cyrix cx5x86 chips podp5v120 : 120 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp5v133 : 133 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus or 120 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus the overdrive processors for the pentium 75 , 90 and 100 were also released ( socket 5 , 3.3 v ) , running at 125 , 150 and 166 & nbsp ; mhz ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) podpmt66x200 : up to 200 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 3.0 ) podpmt66x166 : up to 166 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) podpmt60x180 : up to 180 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 3.0 ) podpmt60x150 : up to 150 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) this combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the pentium ii and the pentium ii xeon : mmx support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed l2 cache , respectively intel pentium overdrive pictures of pentium overdrive intel pentium overdrive support page

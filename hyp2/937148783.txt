it is fitted with a 486-compatible bus unit ( though with an increased pin-count ) , an integrated heatsink and fan , and 32 kb of cpu cache , double the 16 kb offered on regular p54c chips as the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width , per-clock performance was much lower than that of a 'regular ' pentium , though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the pentium 's architectural improvements , such as the much improved fpu the 63 & nbsp ; mhz model was launched in february 1995 , and supported 25 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems the much faster 83 & nbsp ; mhz version , which supported both 25 ( 63 & nbsp ; mhz effective ) and 33 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems , launched much later the same year on october , and was very expensive at 299 compared to other upgrade alternatives , such as those based on am5x86 and cyrix cx5x86 chips system upgrades : intel plans overdrive for pentium systems podp5v120 : 120 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp5v133 : 133 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus or 120 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus the overdrive processors for the pentium 75 , 90 and 100 were also released ( socket 5 , 3.3 v ) , running at 125 , 150 and 166 & nbsp ; mhz ( clock multiplier of 2.5 ) combining the pentium ii deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 kb full speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus , wayback machine archive of heise , accessed april 12 , 2009 as noted in the pentium ii processor update documentation from intel , '' please note that although this processor has a cpuid of 163xh , it uses a pentium ii processor cpuid 065xh processor core

the pentium overdrive is a heavily modified , 3.3 volt pentium p54 core manufactured on 0.6 micrometer technology as the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width , per-clock performance was much lower than that of a 'regular ' pentium , though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the pentium 's architectural improvements , such as the much improved fpu the 63 & nbsp ; mhz model was launched in february 1995 , and supported 25 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems the much faster 83 & nbsp ; mhz version , which supported both 25 ( 63 & nbsp ; mhz effective ) and 33 & nbsp ; mhz bus systems , launched much later the same year on october , and was very expensive at 299 compared to other upgrade alternatives , such as those based on am5x86 and cyrix cx5x86 chips podp5v63 introduced february 3 , 1995 235 pins , p24t pinout 5 or 3.3 volts l1 cache 32 kb ( 16 kb + 16 kb ) 63 mhz on 25 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ( 25 × 2.5 ) podp5v83 introduced october 1995 237 pins , p24t pinout 5 or 3.3 volts l1 cache 32 kb ( 16 kb + 16 kb ) 83 & nbsp ; mhz on 33 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ( 33 × 2.5 ) some 63 cpu models ( part number 109x4405h6j05 ) have 234 pins instead of 235 podp3v125 : 125 & nbsp ; mhz on 50 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp3v150 : 150 & nbsp ; mhz on 60 & nbsp ; mhz bus podp3v166 : 166 & nbsp ; mhz on 66 & nbsp ; mhz bus these were replaced by pentium overdrive & nbsp ; mmx , which also upgraded the pentium 120 - 200 & nbsp ; mhz to the faster version with mmx technology combining the pentium ii deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 kb full speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus , wayback machine archive of heise , accessed april 12 , 2009 as noted in the pentium ii processor update documentation from intel , '' please note that although this processor has a cpuid of 163xh , it uses a pentium ii processor cpuid 065xh processor core

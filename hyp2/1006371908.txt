watercolor painting is extremely old , dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic europe , and has been used for illustrated manuscript since at least ancient egypt but especially in the middle ages the german northern renaissance artist albrecht dürer ( 1471–1528 ) , who painted several fine botanical , wildlife , and landscape watercolors , is generally considered among the earliest exponents of watercolor an important school of watercolor painting in germany was led by hans bol ( 1534–1593 ) as part of the dürer renaissance notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were van dyck ( during his stay in england ) , claude lorrain , giovanni benedetto castiglione , and many dutch and flemish artists however , botanical illustration and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters , and even today , watercolors—with their unique ability to summarize , clarify , and idealize in full color—are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as john james audubon , and today many naturalist field guides are still illustrated with watercolor paintings several factors contributed to the spread of watercolor painting during the 18th century , particularly in england among the elite and aristocratic classes , watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education ; mapmakers , military officers , and engineers used it for its usefulness in depicting properties , terrain , fortifications , field geology , and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects watercolor artists were commonly brought with the geological or archaeological expeditions , funded by the society of dilettanti ( founded in 1733 ) , to document discoveries in the mediterranean , asia , and the new world william blake published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry , provided illustrations to dante 's inferno , and he also experimented with large monotype works in watercolor among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were thomas gainsborough , john robert cozens , francis towne , michael angelo rooker , william pars , thomas hearne , and john warwick smith watercolors were used as the basic document from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed , and hand-painted watercolor originals or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios the confluence of amateur activity , publishing markets , middle class art collecting , and 19th-century technique led to the formation of english watercolor painting societies : the society of painters in water colours ( 1804 , now known as the royal watercolour society ) and the new water colour society ( 1832 , now known as the royal institute of painters in water colours ) they also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates , particularly between advocates of traditional ( '' transparent '' ) watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with gouache ( '' opaque '' watercolor ) watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by varley , cox , and others , establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today ; the elements of drawing , a watercolor tutorial by english art critic john ruskin , has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857 these pigments , in turn , stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media , but in english watercolors , particularly by the pre-raphaelite brotherhood watercolor painting also became popular in the united states during the 19th century ; outstanding early practitioners included john james audubon , as well as early hudson river school painters such as william h the american society of painters in watercolor ( now the american watercolor society ) was founded in 1866 among the many 20th-century artists who produced important works in watercolor , wassily kandinsky , emil nolde , paul klee , egon schiele , and raoul dufy must be mentioned in america , the major exponents included charles burchfield , edward hopper , georgia o'keeffe , charles demuth , and john marin ( 80 % of his total work is watercolor ) in this period , american watercolor painting often imitated european impressionism and post-impressionism , but significant individualism flourished in '' regional '' styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s the california water color society , founded in 1921 and later renamed the national watercolor society , sponsored important exhibitions of their work although the rise of abstract expressionism , and the trivializing influence of amateur painters and advertising- or workshop-influenced painting styles , led to a temporary decline in the popularity of watercolor painting after c 187 the traditional claim that '' transparent '' watercolors gain '' luminosity '' because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper—the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment , reflects from the paper , and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer—is false acrylic painting techniques history of painting ink wash painting : category : watercolorists american watercolor society national watercolor society ( usa ) belgian watercolor institute

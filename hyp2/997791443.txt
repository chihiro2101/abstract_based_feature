the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements unlike previous pentium and pentium pro processors , the pentium ii cpu was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a cpu socket this larger package was a compromise allowing intel to separate the secondary cache from the processor while still keeping it on a closely coupled back-side bus the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level the intel pentium ii ( 'klamath ' ) cpu , tom 's hardware , march 1 , 1997 intel pentium ii , anandtech , may 30 , 1997 to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process ia-32 implementation intel p2 ( incl the deschutes core pentium ii ( 80523 ) , which debuted at 333 & nbsp ; mhz in january 1998 , was produced with a 0.25 μm process and has a significantly lower power draw the pentium ii xeon was a high-end version of deschutes core intended for use on workstations and servers versions were produced with 512 & nbsp ; kb , 1 & nbsp ; mb or 2 & nbsp ; mb l2 caches by varying the number of 512 & nbsp ; kb chips incorporated on the board the 0.25 & nbsp ; μm tonga core was the first mobile pentium ii and had all of the features of the desktop models in intel 's '' family/model/stepping '' scheme , tonga cpus are family 6 , model 5 l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency

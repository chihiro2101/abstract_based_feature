the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements intel 's slot 1 cpus uncovered , tom 's hardware , may 3 , 1998 the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level the intel pentium ii ( 'klamath ' ) cpu , tom 's hardware , march 1 , 1997 intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs the pentium ii was also the first p6-based cpu to implement the intel mmx integer simd instruction set which had already been introduced on the pentium mmx the pentium ii was basically a more consumer-oriented version of the pentium pro the '82459ad ' revision of the chip on some 333 & nbsp ; mhz and all 350 & nbsp ; mhz and faster pentium iis lifted this restriction and also offered a full 4 gb cacheable area the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process the deschutes core pentium ii ( 80523 ) , which debuted at 333 & nbsp ; mhz in january 1998 , was produced with a 0.25 μm process and has a significantly lower power draw the 333 & nbsp ; mhz variant was the final pentium cpu that used the older 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus ; all subsequent deschutes-core models used a 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb combining the deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 & nbsp ; kb full-speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus this combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the pentium ii and the pentium ii xeon : mmx support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed l2 cache , respectively packaging : slot 1 module mmx front-side bus : 66 & nbsp ; mhz , gtl+ vcore : 2.8 & nbsp ; v process : 0.35 & nbsp ; μm cmos first release : may 7 , 1997 clockrate : 233 , 266 , 300 & nbsp ; mhz mobile pentium ii pe ( '' performance enhanced '' ) l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 256 & nbsp ; kb , on-die , full speed

the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements unlike previous pentium and pentium pro processors , the pentium ii cpu was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a cpu socket the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level the intel pentium ii ( 'klamath ' ) cpu , tom 's hardware , march 1 , 1997 intel pentium ii , anandtech , may 30 , 1997 intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs the pentium ii was also the first p6-based cpu to implement the intel mmx integer simd instruction set which had already been introduced on the pentium mmx presumably , intel put this limitation deliberately in place to distinguish the pentium ii from the more upmarket pentium pro line , which has a full 4 & nbsp ; gb cacheable area the '82459ad ' revision of the chip on some 333 & nbsp ; mhz and all 350 & nbsp ; mhz and faster pentium iis lifted this restriction and also offered a full 4 gb cacheable area the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process on july 14 , 1997 , intel announced a version of the pentium ii klamath with 2× 72-bit ecc l2 cache for entry-level servers , as opposed to the 2× 64-bit non-ecc l2 cache on regular models while klamath features 4 cache chips and simulates dual-porting through interleaving ( 2x 64-bit ) for a slight performance improvement on concurrent accesses , deschutes only sports 2 cache chips and offers slightly lower l2 cache performance at the same clockspeed this combination brought together some of the more attractive aspects of the pentium ii and the pentium ii xeon : mmx support/improved 16-bit performance and full-speed l2 cache , respectively mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency mobile pentium ii pe ( '' performance enhanced '' ) l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 256 & nbsp ; kb , on-die , full speed

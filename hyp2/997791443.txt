the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements unlike previous pentium and pentium pro processors , the pentium ii cpu was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a cpu socket the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches the pentium ii was also the first p6-based cpu to implement the intel mmx integer simd instruction set which had already been introduced on the pentium mmx the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process on july 14 , 1997 , intel announced a version of the pentium ii klamath with 2× 72-bit ecc l2 cache for entry-level servers , as opposed to the 2× 64-bit non-ecc l2 cache on regular models the deschutes core pentium ii ( 80523 ) , which debuted at 333 & nbsp ; mhz in january 1998 , was produced with a 0.25 μm process and has a significantly lower power draw the pentium ii xeon was a high-end version of deschutes core intended for use on workstations and servers intel 's pentium ii xeon processor , tom 's hardware , july 2 , 1998 in 1998 , the 0.25 μm deschutes core was utilized in the creation of the pentium ii overdrive processor , which was aimed at allowing corporate pentium pro users to upgrade their aging servers combining the deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 & nbsp ; kb full-speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus wayback machine archive of heise , accessed june 17 , 2009 the later '' dixon '' mobile pentium ii would emulate this combination with 256 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache later , in 1999 , the 0.25 ; 0.18 ( 400 & nbsp ; mhz ) μm dixon core with 256 & nbsp ; kb of on-die full speed cache was produced for the mobile market l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency

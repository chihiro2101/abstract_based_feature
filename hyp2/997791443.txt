the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements unlike previous pentium and pentium pro processors , the pentium ii cpu was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a cpu socket this larger package was a compromise allowing intel to separate the secondary cache from the processor while still keeping it on a closely coupled back-side bus however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level intel improved 16-bit code execution performance on the pentium ii , an area in which the pentium pro was at a notable handicap , by adding segment register caches to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs the pentium ii was basically a more consumer-oriented version of the pentium pro presumably , intel put this limitation deliberately in place to distinguish the pentium ii from the more upmarket pentium pro line , which has a full 4 & nbsp ; gb cacheable area the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process these cpus had a 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus and were initially used on motherboards equipped with the aging intel 440fx natoma chipset designed for the pentium pro later in 1998 , pentium iis running at 266 , 300 , 350 , 400 , and 450 & nbsp ; mhz were also released rather than destroy already multiplier-locked units , those deschutes units that had been tested and locked with a multiplier of 5 were sold as being 333 & nbsp ; mhz replacing the aged 66 & nbsp ; mhz fsb , which had been on the market since 1993 , the 100 & nbsp ; mhz fsb resulted in solid performance improvements for the pentium ii lineup combining the deschutes core in a flip-chip package with a 512 & nbsp ; kb full-speed l2 cache chip from the pentium ii xeon into a socket 8-compatible module resulted in a 300 or 333 & nbsp ; mhz processor that could run on a 60 or 66 & nbsp ; mhz front side bus the 0.25 & nbsp ; μm tonga core was the first mobile pentium ii and had all of the features of the desktop models mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency mobile pentium ii pe ( '' performance enhanced '' ) l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 256 & nbsp ; kb , on-die , full speed

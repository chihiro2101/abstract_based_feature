the pentium ii microprocessor was largely based upon the microarchitecture of its predecessor , the pentium pro , but with some significant improvements unlike previous pentium and pentium pro processors , the pentium ii cpu was packaged in a slot-based module rather than a cpu socket this larger package was a compromise allowing intel to separate the secondary cache from the processor while still keeping it on a closely coupled back-side bus the l2 cache ran at half the processor 's clock frequency , unlike the pentium pro , whose off die l2 cache ran at the same frequency as the processor however , its associativity was increased to 16-way ( compared to 4-way on the pentium pro ) and its size was always 512 & nbsp ; kb , twice of the smallest option of 256 & nbsp ; kb on the pentium pro off-package cache solved the pentium pro 's low yield issues , allowing intel to introduce the pentium ii at a mainstream price level intel pentium ii , anandtech , may 30 , 1997 to compensate for the slower l2 cache , the pentium ii featured 32 & nbsp ; kb of l1 cache , double that of the pentium pro , as well as 4 write buffers ( vs the pentium ii was also the first p6-based cpu to implement the intel mmx integer simd instruction set which had already been introduced on the pentium mmx the pentium ii was basically a more consumer-oriented version of the pentium pro the original klamath pentium ii microprocessor ( intel product code 80522 ) ran at 233 , 266 , and 300 & nbsp ; mhz and was produced in a 0.35 μm process the 300 & nbsp ; mhz version , however , only became available in quantities later in 1997 the deschutes core pentium ii ( 80523 ) , which debuted at 333 & nbsp ; mhz in january 1998 , was produced with a 0.25 μm process and has a significantly lower power draw intel 's pentium ii xeon processor , tom 's hardware , july 2 , 1998 wayback machine archive of heise , accessed june 17 , 2009 the later '' dixon '' mobile pentium ii would emulate this combination with 256 & nbsp ; kb of full-speed cache l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency mobile pentium ii l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 512 & nbsp ; kb , as external chips on the cpu module clocked at half the cpu frequency mobile pentium ii pe ( '' performance enhanced '' ) l1 cache : 16 + 16 & nbsp ; kb ( data + instructions ) l2 cache : 256 & nbsp ; kb , on-die , full speed

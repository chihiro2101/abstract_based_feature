since its original inception , the telegraph key 's design has developed such that there are now multiple types of keys a straight key is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies traditionally , american telegraph keys had flat topped knobs and narrow bars ( frequently curved ) , while british telegraph keys had ball shaped knobs and thick bars the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages this was to complete the electrical path to the next station so that its sounder would operate , as in the operator receiving a message from the next town the straight key is simple and reliable , but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots ( or dits as most operators call them ) poses some significant drawbacks in addition to the basic up-and-down telegraph key , telegraphers have been experimenting with alternate key designs from the beginning of telegraphy from the mid-20th century electronic devices called '' keyers '' have been developed , operated by special keys of various designs generally categorized as single-paddle keys and '' iambic '' or double-paddle keys although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used , nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action ; semi-automatic key thumb a popular side-to-side key is the semi-automatic key or bug , sometimes known as a vibroplex key , after the company that first manufactured them when pressed to one side , the keyer electronics generate a series of '' dahs '' ; when pressed to the other side , a series of '' dits '' keyers work with two different types of keys : single paddle and double paddle keys like semi-automatic keys , pressing the paddle on one side produces a dit and the other a dah double paddle keys are also called '' iambic '' keys or '' squeeze '' keys keys having two separate levers , one for dits and the other for dahs are called dual or dual-lever paddles when a single-paddle key is used with an electronic keyer , continuous dits are created by holding the dit side simple telegraph-like keys were long used to control the flow of electricity in laboratory tests of electrical circuits modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called '' keys '' due to their origins as telegraph keys

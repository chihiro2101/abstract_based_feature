since its original inception , the telegraph key 's design has developed such that there are now multiple types of keys a straight key is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies it is a simple bar with a knob on top and a switch underneath traditionally , american telegraph keys had flat topped knobs and narrow bars ( frequently curved ) , while british telegraph keys had ball shaped knobs and thick bars the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages this was to complete the electrical path to the next station so that its sounder would operate , as in the operator receiving a message from the next town although occasionally included in later keys for reasons of tradition , the shorting bar is unnecessary for radio telegraphy , except as a convenience when tuning the transmitter in the early days of telegraphy , a number of professional telegraphers developed a repetitive stress injury known as glass arm or telegrapher 's paralysis in addition to the basic up-and-down telegraph key , telegraphers have been experimenting with alternate key designs from the beginning of telegraphy ; sideswipers the first widely accepted alternative key was the sideswiper or sidewinder , sometimes called a cootie key or bushwhacker although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used , nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action '' keyers work with two different types of keys : single paddle and double paddle keys single paddle keys are also called single lever keys or sideswipers , the same name as the older side-to-side key design they greatly resemble thumb using a keyer in what 's called '' iambic '' mode requires a key with two paddles : one paddle produces dits and the other produces dahs when a single-paddle key is used with an electronic keyer , continuous dits are created by holding the dit side simple telegraph-like keys were long used to control the flow of electricity in laboratory tests of electrical circuits telegraph keys were once used in the study of operant conditioning with pigeons modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called '' keys '' due to their origins as telegraph keys

since its original inception , the telegraph key 's design has developed such that there are now multiple types of keys a straight key is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages the straight key is simple and reliable , but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots ( or dits as most operators call them ) poses some significant drawbacks transmission speeds vary from 5 & nbsp ; words ( 25 & nbsp ; characters ) per minute , by novice operators , up to about 30 & nbsp ; words ( 150 & nbsp ; characters ) per minute by skilled operators in addition to the basic up-and-down telegraph key , telegraphers have been experimenting with alternate key designs from the beginning of telegraphy when the paddle is pressed to the left it makes a continuous contact suitable for sending dashes ( or dahs , as most operators call them ) ; electronic keyers and paddle keys like semi-automatic keys , the telegrapher operates an electronic keyer paddle by swinging the lever from side-to-side when pressed to one side , the keyer electronics generate a series of '' dahs '' ; when pressed to the other side , a series of '' dits '' keyers work with two different types of keys : single paddle and double paddle keys like semi-automatic keys , pressing the paddle on one side produces a dit and the other a dah single paddle keys are also called single lever keys or sideswipers , the same name as the older side-to-side key design they greatly resemble double paddle keys are also called '' iambic '' keys or '' squeeze '' keys most electronic keyers include dot and / or dash memory functions , so the operator do not need to use perfect spacing between dits and dahs or vice versa when a single-paddle key is used with an electronic keyer , continuous dits are created by holding the dit side a third electronic keyer mode useful with a dual paddle is the '' ultimatic '' mode , named for the electronic keyer that introduced it simple telegraph-like keys were long used to control the flow of electricity in laboratory tests of electrical circuits modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called '' keys '' due to their origins as telegraph keys

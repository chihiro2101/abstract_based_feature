a straight key is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages from the mid-20th century electronic devices called '' keyers '' have been developed , operated by special keys of various designs generally categorized as single-paddle keys and '' iambic '' or double-paddle keys although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used , nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action ; electronic keyers and paddle keys like semi-automatic keys , the telegrapher operates an electronic keyer paddle by swinging the lever from side-to-side '' keyers work with two different types of keys : single paddle and double paddle keys double paddle keys are also called '' iambic '' keys or '' squeeze '' keys single paddle keys are essentially the same as sideswiper keys with separate contacts on the left and right most electronic keyers include dot and / or dash memory functions , so the operator do not need to use perfect spacing between dits and dahs or vice versa keys having two separate levers , one for dits and the other for dahs are called dual or dual-lever paddles with a dual paddle both contacts may be closed simultaneously , enabling the '' iambic '' functions of an electronic keyer that is designed to support them the operator can create a series of alternating dits and dahs ( similar to a sequence of iamb ( poetry ) ) by squeezing the levers together . for that reason , dual paddles are sometimes called squeeze keys insofar as iambic keying is a function of the electronic keyer , it is technically incorrect to refer to a dual paddle as an '' iambic '' paddle , although this has often been done for marketing purposes a dual paddle is required for iambic sending with an iambic keyer , but it can be used without squeezing and there are electronic keyers which do not offer iambic functions iambic keyers function in one of at least two major modes : mode & nbsp ; a and mode & nbsp ; b when the paddles are released , the keying continues by sending one more element , i.e a third electronic keyer mode useful with a dual paddle is the '' ultimatic '' mode , named for the electronic keyer that introduced it

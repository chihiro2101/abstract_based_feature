since its original inception , the telegraph key 's design has developed such that there are now multiple types of keys a straight key is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages in addition to the basic up-and-down telegraph key , telegraphers have been experimenting with alternate key designs from the beginning of telegraphy ; sideswipers the first widely accepted alternative key was the sideswiper or sidewinder , sometimes called a cootie key or bushwhacker although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used , nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action a skilled operator can achieve sending speeds in excess of 40 & nbsp ; words per minute with a ‘ bug ’ ; electronic keyers and paddle keys like semi-automatic keys , the telegrapher operates an electronic keyer paddle by swinging the lever from side-to-side when pressed to one side , the keyer electronics generate a series of '' dahs '' ; when pressed to the other side , a series of '' dits '' keyers work with two different types of keys : single paddle and double paddle keys double paddle keys are also called '' iambic '' keys or '' squeeze '' keys single paddle keys are essentially the same as sideswiper keys with separate contacts on the left and right an additional advantage of electronic keyers over semiautomatic keys is that code speed is easily changed with electronic keyers , just by turning a knob a dual paddle is required for iambic sending with an iambic keyer , but it can be used without squeezing and there are electronic keyers which do not offer iambic functions in mode & nbsp ; b , dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed simple telegraph-like keys were long used to control the flow of electricity in laboratory tests of electrical circuits telegraph keys were once used in the study of operant conditioning with pigeons modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called '' keys '' due to their origins as telegraph keys

since its original inception , the telegraph key 's design has developed such that there are now multiple types of keys a straight key is the common telegraph key as seen in various movies traditionally , american telegraph keys had flat topped knobs and narrow bars ( frequently curved ) , while british telegraph keys had ball shaped knobs and thick bars the straight keys used in wire telegraphy also had a shorting bar that closed the electrical circuit when the operator was not actively sending messages from the mid-20th century electronic devices called '' keyers '' have been developed , operated by special keys of various designs generally categorized as single-paddle keys and '' iambic '' or double-paddle keys ; sideswipers the first widely accepted alternative key was the sideswiper or sidewinder , sometimes called a cootie key or bushwhacker although the original sideswiper is now rarely seen or used , nearly all advanced keys use some form of side-to-side action ; electronic keyers and paddle keys like semi-automatic keys , the telegrapher operates an electronic keyer paddle by swinging the lever from side-to-side when pressed to one side , the keyer electronics generate a series of '' dahs '' ; when pressed to the other side , a series of '' dits like semi-automatic keys , pressing the paddle on one side produces a dit and the other a dah single paddle keys are also called single lever keys or sideswipers , the same name as the older side-to-side key design they greatly resemble double paddle keys are also called '' iambic '' keys or '' squeeze '' keys single paddle keys are essentially the same as sideswiper keys with separate contacts on the left and right with dit or dah memory , the operator 's keying action can be about one dit ahead of the actual transmission thumb using a keyer in what 's called '' iambic '' mode requires a key with two paddles : one paddle produces dits and the other produces dahs when a single-paddle key is used with an electronic keyer , continuous dits are created by holding the dit side mode & nbsp ; a is the original iambic mode , in which alternate dots and dashes are produced as long as both paddles are depressed modern pigeon response keys are specially made switches but are still called '' keys '' due to their origins as telegraph keys

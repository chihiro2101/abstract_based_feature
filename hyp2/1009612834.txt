theory of everything : is there a theory which explains the values of all fundamental physical constants , i.e can a multiverse resolve it ? yang–mills theory : given an arbitrary compact gauge group , does a non-trivial quantum yang–mills theory with a finite mass gap exist ? ( this problem is also listed as one of the millennium prize problems in mathematics ) color confinement : the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) color confinement conjecture is that color charged particles ( such as quarks and gluons ) can not be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons is it possible to provide an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory ? dimensionless physical constant : at the present time , the values of the dimensionless physical constants can not be calculated ; they are determined only by physical measurement m , cosmic coincidences : dark matter , mankind , and anthropic cosmology p in general relativity time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime , and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer the cosmic inflation hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable , but , since 2003 , jean-pierre luminet , et al current cosmological models say there should be very little structure on scales larger than a few hundred million light years across , due to the expansion of the universe trumping the effect of gravity extra dimensions : does nature have more than four spacetime dimensions ? if so , what is their size ? are dimensions a fundamental property of the universe or an emergent result of other physical laws ? can we experimentally observe evidence of higher spatial dimensions ? hierarchy problem : why is gravity such a weak force ? it becomes strong for particles only at the planck mass , around 10 gev , much above the electroweak scale ( 100 gev , the energy scale dominating physics at low energies ) the sum of the masses of the three charged leptons , divided by the square of the sum of the roots of these masses , to within one standard deviation of observations , is q \frac 2 3 the cosmic-microwave-background data shows several features of anisotropy , which are not consistent with the big bang model plasma physics and fusion power : fusion energy may potentially provide power from abundant resource ( e.g alfvénic turbulence : in the solar wind and the turbulence in solar flares , coronal mass ejections , and magnetospheric substorms are major unsolved problems in space plasma physics

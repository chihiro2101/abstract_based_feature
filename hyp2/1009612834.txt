theory of everything : is there a theory which explains the values of all fundamental physical constants , i.e can a multiverse resolve it ? yang–mills theory : given an arbitrary compact gauge group , does a non-trivial quantum yang–mills theory with a finite mass gap exist ? ( this problem is also listed as one of the millennium prize problems in mathematics is it possible to provide an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory ? dimensionless physical constant : at the present time , the values of the dimensionless physical constants can not be calculated ; they are determined only by physical measurement what is the minimum number of dimensionless physical constants from which all other dimensionless physical constants can be derived ? are dimensional physical constants necessary at all ? fine-tuned universe : the values of the fundamental physical constants are in a narrow range necessary to support carbon-based life 7 , 269 , 1989 , is this because there exist multiverse with different constants , or are our universe 's constants the result of chance , or some other factor or process ? in particular , tegmark 's mathematical universe hypothesis of abstract mathematics parallel universe formalized models , and the string theory landscape of spacetime regions having different formalized sets of laws and physical constants from that of the surrounding space—require formalization problem of time : in quantum mechanics time is a classical background parameter and the flow of time is universal and absolute in general relativity time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime , and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer of a comoving spatial section of the universe , informally called the '' shape '' of the universe ? neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known , though the curvature is known to be '' close '' to zero on observable scales the cosmic inflation hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable , but , since 2003 , jean-pierre luminet , et al current cosmological models say there should be very little structure on scales larger than a few hundred million light years across , due to the expansion of the universe trumping the effect of gravity extra dimensions : does nature have more than four spacetime dimensions ? if so , what is their size ? are dimensions a fundamental property of the universe or an emergent result of other physical laws ? can we experimentally observe evidence of higher spatial dimensions ? hierarchy problem : why is gravity such a weak force ? it becomes strong for particles only at the planck mass , around 10 gev , much above the electroweak scale ( 100 gev , the energy scale dominating physics at low energies ) under what conditions do navier–stokes existence and smoothness , which are the equations that describe the flow of an incompressible fluid ? this problem is also listed as one of the millennium prize problems in mathematics alfvénic turbulence : in the solar wind and the turbulence in solar flares , coronal mass ejections , and magnetospheric substorms are major unsolved problems in space plasma physics

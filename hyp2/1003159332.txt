prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone from 1768 there were a number of grand schemes proposed , all with the aim of linking the bristol channel to the english channel by a waterway , thereby avoiding the need to navigate by sea around cornwall and devon james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route in 1769 , robert whitworth looked at a shorter route from bridgwater bay to seaton , following the river parrett and the river axe william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively he then considered a more modest proposal , based on the original bristol and western plans , and the scheme , now renamed the bristol and taunton canal , was authorised by an act of parliament dated 14 may 1811 a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company thomas telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824 , which would have taken over the line of the bridgwater and taunton canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced the lock at firepool ( taunton ) had a set of reverse-facing gates , to prevent the canal draining if the level of the river tone dropped a system of paddle gearing – using metal ball weights at the top and metal cylinder weights at the bottom – is unique to the bridgwater and taunton canal the early years of the new canal were marred by legal disputes with the conservators of the river tone the conservators promptly built a dam , to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal , which they removed after further legal action and an order of the chancery court reconciliation finally came in late 1831 , when the two parties proposed a new act of parliament to authorise the sale of the tone navigation to the canal company this was obtained in july 1832 , and required the canal company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing north town bridge , which hampered access to the wharfs in taunton they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order at the bridgwater end , navigation onto the river parrett was not easy , and the corporation of bridgwater had commissioned a number of surveys to construct a floating harbour there it entered bridgwater docks , which consisted of : inner basin that covered outer basin covering the two basins were connected by a lock , whilst towards the river a ship lock consisting of a single gate , and a barge lock , consisting of a pair of gates the main source of water was the river tone , although this was not fed into the canal at firepool , in order to ensure that the mills on the upper section could function the remaining traffic moved to the railway , the last commercial boats used the canal , from bridgwater dock to a wharf in north town , taunton , in 1907 , and the canal was effectively closed boating on the canal is encouraged , although the lack of a link to the river parrett at bridgwater is restrictive at this point , the parrett is a salt water river , and is laden with silt , whereas the canal contains fresh water the canal forms part of the local flood relief system , in winter taking water from the river tone at taunton and discharging it into the parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of bridgwater , near the bridgwater canalside centre the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association

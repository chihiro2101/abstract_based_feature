prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone the initial work was completed by 1717 , although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route in 1769 , robert whitworth looked at a shorter route from bridgwater bay to seaton , following the river parrett and the river axe william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company james green proposed a tub-boat canal in 1822 , capable of handling boats , which would have used inclines instead of locks , and would have cost £120,000 thomas telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824 , which would have taken over the line of the bridgwater and taunton canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced construction of the canal began in 1822 , with james hollinsworth as the engineer and john easton obtaining an injunction , and work on the lower half of the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 act a system of paddle gearing – using metal ball weights at the top and metal cylinder weights at the bottom – is unique to the bridgwater and taunton canal the canal was an obvious competitor to the river tone navigation , which was managed by the conservators of the river tone , a legal body created for that purpose by act of parliament in 1699 the canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 january 1827 , but the opening was delayed until 3 january , as the connection to the river tone was not made until 2 january the connection to the tone at taunton had been made forcibly , by the canal company breaching the bank of the river the conservators promptly built a dam , to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal , which they removed after further legal action and an order of the chancery court they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order at the bridgwater end , navigation onto the river parrett was not easy , and the corporation of bridgwater had commissioned a number of surveys to construct a floating harbour subsequently the canal company , in order to protect their trade , sought their own act to construct a floating harbour to the west of bridgwater , and to extend the canal to join it the new owners were remote , and were more interested in the water supply for taunton station and for the bridgwater dock , than running the canal as a going concern , with the result that the canal deteriorated further the remaining traffic moved to the railway , the last commercial boats used the canal , from bridgwater dock to a wharf in north town , taunton , in 1907 , and the canal was effectively closed restoration of the bridges at the taunton end continued during the early 1990s , and the canal was finally re-opened in 1994 boating on the canal is encouraged , although the lack of a link to the river parrett at bridgwater is restrictive the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association

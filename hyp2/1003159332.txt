prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone the tone had been improved by its conservators , who had obtained act of parliament in 1699 and 1707 , which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the parrett , and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route in 1769 , robert whitworth looked at a shorter route from bridgwater bay to seaton , following the river parrett and the river axe william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively he then considered a more modest proposal , based on the original bristol and western plans , and the scheme , now renamed the bristol and taunton canal , was authorised by an act of parliament dated 14 may 1811 a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company the lock at firepool ( taunton ) had a set of reverse-facing gates , to prevent the canal draining if the level of the river tone dropped a system of paddle gearing – using metal ball weights at the top and metal cylinder weights at the bottom – is unique to the bridgwater and taunton canal there was animosity between the company and the conservators , with the company maintaining that they had a right to use the tone to reach the centre of taunton , and the conservators maintaining that they did not the canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 january 1827 , but the opening was delayed until 3 january , as the connection to the river tone was not made until 2 january the early years of the new canal were marred by legal disputes with the conservators of the river tone the connection to the tone at taunton had been made forcibly , by the canal company breaching the bank of the river despite a ruling by the court of king 's bench that their action was illegal , the canal company held on to the river until a high court judgement in february 1830 reconciliation finally came in late 1831 , when the two parties proposed a new act of parliament to authorise the sale of the tone navigation to the canal company they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order there it entered bridgwater docks , which consisted of : inner basin that covered outer basin covering the two basins were connected by a lock , whilst towards the river a ship lock consisting of a single gate , and a barge lock , consisting of a pair of gates the canal company had hoped that the opening of the grand western canal in 1838 and the chard canal in 1842 would increase traffic significantly , but their impact was marginal large volumes of water were discharged from the canal every fortnight , when the bridgwater dock was scoured , in order to free it from silt , while the railway company was extracting water to supply the station and steam locomotive sheds at taunton the new owners were remote , and were more interested in the water supply for taunton station and for the bridgwater dock , than running the canal as a going concern , with the result that the canal deteriorated further the opening by the great western railway of the severn tunnel in 1886 brought further decline , for the imports of coal and slate from south wales to bridgwater dock and the canal could now be moved more directly the remaining traffic moved to the railway , the last commercial boats used the canal , from bridgwater dock to a wharf in north town , taunton , in 1907 , and the canal was effectively closed restoration of the bridges at the taunton end continued during the early 1990s , and the canal was finally re-opened in 1994 the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association

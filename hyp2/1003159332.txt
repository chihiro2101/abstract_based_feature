prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone the tone had been improved by its conservators , who had obtained act of parliament in 1699 and 1707 , which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the parrett , and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels the initial work was completed by 1717 , although further improvements including more locks continued to be made until the early 19th century james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million he then considered a more modest proposal , based on the original bristol and western plans , and the scheme , now renamed the bristol and taunton canal , was authorised by an act of parliament dated 14 may 1811 powers for the bristol to bridgwater section lapsed in 1815 , but work finally commenced in 1822 , to be halted by an injunction because the authorised route was not being followed a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company thomas telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824 , which would have taken over the line of the bridgwater and taunton canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced it included a embankment at lyng , which was high , two short cuttings , eleven brick-built bridges to carry roads over the canal , and more than twelve timber swing bridges , built to provide accommodation bridges for farms which had been divided by the line of the canal the lock at firepool ( taunton ) had a set of reverse-facing gates , to prevent the canal draining if the level of the river tone dropped a system of paddle gearing – using metal ball weights at the top and metal cylinder weights at the bottom – is unique to the bridgwater and taunton canal despite a ruling by the court of king 's bench that their action was illegal , the canal company held on to the river until a high court judgement in february 1830 the conservators promptly built a dam , to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal , which they removed after further legal action and an order of the chancery court reconciliation finally came in late 1831 , when the two parties proposed a new act of parliament to authorise the sale of the tone navigation to the canal company they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order at the bridgwater end , navigation onto the river parrett was not easy , and the corporation of bridgwater had commissioned a number of surveys to construct a floating harbour all came to nothing , but in 1836 the bristol and exeter railway company obtained an act to construct a railway which would pass through bridgwater the opening by the great western railway of the severn tunnel in 1886 brought further decline , for the imports of coal and slate from south wales to bridgwater dock and the canal could now be moved more directly the remaining traffic moved to the railway , the last commercial boats used the canal , from bridgwater dock to a wharf in north town , taunton , in 1907 , and the canal was effectively closed bridgwater and taunton canal at canals.com the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association

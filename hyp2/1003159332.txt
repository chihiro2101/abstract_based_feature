prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone the tone had been improved by its conservators , who had obtained act of parliament in 1699 and 1707 , which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the parrett , and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels from 1768 there were a number of grand schemes proposed , all with the aim of linking the bristol channel to the english channel by a waterway , thereby avoiding the need to navigate by sea around cornwall and devon james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company thomas telford revived the idea of a ship canal in 1824 , which would have taken over the line of the bridgwater and taunton canal – enabling boats to reach the south coast – at a cost of £1.75 million finally , a barge canal between bridgwater and beer , costing £600,000 , was proposed in 1828 , but enthusiasm for large canal schemes was waning , and the advent of iron-hulled steamships meant that the risks of navigation around the south-west peninsula were reduced construction of the canal began in 1822 , with james hollinsworth as the engineer and john easton obtaining an injunction , and work on the lower half of the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 act it included a embankment at lyng , which was high , two short cuttings , eleven brick-built bridges to carry roads over the canal , and more than twelve timber swing bridges , built to provide accommodation bridges for farms which had been divided by the line of the canal one final lock connected the basin to the river , and again it had a set of reverse-facing gates , so that the basin could be drained at low tide , and the low level retained for maintenance if required by mid-1826 , the canal company had insufficient funds to complete the work , and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit the early years of the new canal were marred by legal disputes with the conservators of the river tone the connection to the tone at taunton had been made forcibly , by the canal company breaching the bank of the river the conservators promptly built a dam , to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal , which they removed after further legal action and an order of the chancery court reconciliation finally came in late 1831 , when the two parties proposed a new act of parliament to authorise the sale of the tone navigation to the canal company they also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at french weir , to connect with the grand western canal , while the conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal , and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order unlike many such acquisitions , the canal was seen as a useful adjunct to the railway network , and was maintained in good order for several years , with the conservators of the river tone continuing their annual inspections , and reporting any defects to the railway company the main source of water was the river tone , although this was not fed into the canal at firepool , in order to ensure that the mills on the upper section could function instead water was pumped out of the river at creech , by the charlton pumping station , where the river and canal were only apart the remaining traffic moved to the railway , the last commercial boats used the canal , from bridgwater dock to a wharf in north town , taunton , in 1907 , and the canal was effectively closed the canal forms part of the local flood relief system , in winter taking water from the river tone at taunton and discharging it into the parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of bridgwater , near the bridgwater canalside centre the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association

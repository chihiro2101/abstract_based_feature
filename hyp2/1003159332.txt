prior to the building of the canal , navigation between the towns of bridgwater and taunton was possible by using the river parrett and the river tone the tone had been improved by its conservators , who had obtained act of parliament in 1699 and 1707 , which had allowed them to straighten and dredge the river and parts of the parrett , and to build locks and half-locks to manage the water levels james brindley was the first to survey a route , which would have run from the bristol channel to exeter , following the course of the river tone for part of its route william jessop surveyed a route between taunton and exeter in 1794 , while another group proposed a canal linking bristol , nailsea , bridgwater and taunton , which was surveyed by william white jessop 's assistant , josiah easton , suggested a route from uphill ( on the bristol channel ) to seaton , again in 1794 , and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the grand western canal and the bristol and western canal , respectively john rennie surveyed the line for a ship canal from the mouth of the river parrett to seaton in 1810 , which was designed for ships of , but it was felt that the economic situation would not support the projected expenditure of over £1 & nbsp ; million he then considered a more modest proposal , based on the original bristol and western plans , and the scheme , now renamed the bristol and taunton canal , was authorised by an act of parliament dated 14 may 1811 powers for the bristol to bridgwater section lapsed in 1815 , but work finally commenced in 1822 , to be halted by an injunction because the authorised route was not being followed a further act , of 17 june 1824 , authorised the revised route , and changed the name of the project to the bridgwater and taunton canal company the predicted costs for the construction of the shorter canal were £34,145 , as opposed to £429,990 for the longer scheme james green proposed a tub-boat canal in 1822 , capable of handling boats , which would have used inclines instead of locks , and would have cost £120,000 construction of the canal began in 1822 , with james hollinsworth as the engineer and john easton obtaining an injunction , and work on the lower half of the canal stopped until the new route could be properly authorised by the 1824 act the lock at firepool ( taunton ) had a set of reverse-facing gates , to prevent the canal draining if the level of the river tone dropped over fifty culverts were built to carry streams and ditch under the canal by mid-1826 , the canal company had insufficient funds to complete the work , and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit the early years of the new canal were marred by legal disputes with the conservators of the river tone the connection to the tone at taunton had been made forcibly , by the canal company breaching the bank of the river the conservators promptly built a dam , to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal , which they removed after further legal action and an order of the chancery court this was obtained in july 1832 , and required the canal company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing north town bridge , which hampered access to the wharfs in taunton all came to nothing , but in 1836 the bristol and exeter railway company obtained an act to construct a railway which would pass through bridgwater subsequently the canal company , in order to protect their trade , sought their own act to construct a floating harbour to the west of bridgwater , and to extend the canal to join it the construction work involved a deep cutting from albert street to west street , a short tunnel at west street at this point , the parrett is a salt water river , and is laden with silt , whereas the canal contains fresh water not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal , but the salt water can not be allowed to contaminate the fresh , as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of bridgwater the bridgwater and taunton canal by john swayne bridgwater and taunton canal - the route bridgwater and taunton canal from the inland waterways association

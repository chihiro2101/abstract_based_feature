in current technical usage , for one to state that a feature is deprecated is merely a recommendation against using it it is still possible to produce a program or product without heeding the deprecation while a deprecated software feature remains in the software , its use may raise warning messages recommending alternative practices deprecated status may also indicate the feature will be removed in the future features are deprecated , rather than immediately removed , to provide backward compatibility and to give programmers time to bring affected code into compliance with the new standard among the most common reasons for deprecation are : the feature has been replaced by a more powerful alternative feature the feature contains a design flaw , frequently a security flaw , and so should be avoided , but existing code depends upon it the feature is considered extraneous , and will be removed in the future in order to simplify the system as a whole standardization would result in the use of only one of the regional spellings throughout , and all occurrences of the other spelling would be deprecated in technical standards , use of a certain clause may be discouraged or superseded by new clauses

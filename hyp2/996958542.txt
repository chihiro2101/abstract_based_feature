in current technical usage , for one to state that a feature is deprecated is merely a recommendation against using it while a deprecated software feature remains in the software , its use may raise warning messages recommending alternative practices deprecated status may also indicate the feature will be removed in the future features are deprecated , rather than immediately removed , to provide backward compatibility and to give programmers time to bring affected code into compliance with the new standard among the most common reasons for deprecation are : the feature has been replaced by a more powerful alternative feature the feature is considered extraneous , and will be removed in the future in order to simplify the system as a whole the original name will likely remain indefinitely , but will be deprecated to encourage use of the newer , more consistent naming convention standardization would result in the use of only one of the regional spellings throughout , and all occurrences of the other spelling would be deprecated a building code example is the use of ungrounded ( '' 2-prong '' ) electrical receptacles the term deprecated may also be used when a technical term becomes obsolete , either through change or supersession

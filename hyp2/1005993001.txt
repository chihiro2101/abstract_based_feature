alan marshall and michael smith are two examples of this , as cited by peter vardy in '' the puzzle of ethics '' peter vardy , paul grosch : the puzzle of ethics according to marshall , three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years : libertarian extension , the ecologic extension , and conservation ethics in environmentalism , the community is generally thought to consist of non-humans as well as humans andrew brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism ( eco-humanism ) , the argument that all ontological entities , animate and inanimate , can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself their argument falls under both the libertarian extension and the ecologic extension he reasoned that the '' expanding circle of moral worth '' should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals , and to not do so would be guilty of speciesism singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic alan marshall 's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence of all biological ( and some abiological ) entities and their essential diversity ecological extension is roughly the same classification of smith 's eco-holism , and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity the planet is characterized as a unified , holism entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run marshall 's category of 'conservation ethics ' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world the christian world view sees the universe as created by god , and humankind accountable to god for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind adeney : global ethics in new dictionary of christian ethics and pastoral theology 1995 leicester ) abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public these religious scholars , columnists and politicians historically have used these ideas and continue to do so to justify the consumptive tendencies of a young america around the time of the industrial revolution detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them ( see speciesism ) instead , norton distinguishes between strong anthropocentrism and weak-or-extended-anthropocentrism and argues that the former must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world humans are central because only they can secure life beyond the duration of the sun , possibly for trillions of eons in germany , the university of greifswald has recently established an international program in landscape ecology & nature conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics stanford university : ott , konrad ( 2020 ) : environmental ethics

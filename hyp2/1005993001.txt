alan marshall and michael smith are two examples of this , as cited by peter vardy in '' the puzzle of ethics according to marshall , three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years : libertarian extension , the ecologic extension , and conservation ethics in environmentalism , the community is generally thought to consist of non-humans as well as humans deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself he reasoned that the '' expanding circle of moral worth '' should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals , and to not do so would be guilty of speciesism singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth peter singer : practical ethics however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic alan marshall 's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence of all biological ( and some abiological ) entities and their essential diversity ecological extension is roughly the same classification of smith 's eco-holism , and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity the planet is characterized as a unified , holism entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run peter singer advocated the preservation of '' world heritage sites , '' unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a '' scarcity value '' as they diminish over time a good example of a world heritage site would be the tropical rainforest , a very specialist ecosystem that has taken centuries to evolve the christian world view sees the universe as created by god , and humankind accountable to god for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind this applies both in breadth of scope - caring for people ( matthew 25 ) and environmental issues , e.g adeney : global ethics in new dictionary of christian ethics and pastoral theology 1995 leicester ) abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public these religious scholars , columnists and politicians historically have used these ideas and continue to do so to justify the consumptive tendencies of a young america around the time of the industrial revolution in order to solidify the understanding that god had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources , environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature , on a higher order detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them ( see speciesism ) weak anthropocentrism , however , argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view , thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it in germany , the university of greifswald has recently established an international program in landscape ecology & nature conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics stanford university : ott , konrad ( 2020 ) : environmental ethics

alan marshall and michael smith are two examples of this , as cited by peter vardy in '' the puzzle of ethics '' peter vardy , paul grosch : the puzzle of ethics according to marshall , three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years : libertarian extension , the ecologic extension , and conservation ethics marshall ’ s libertarian extension echoes a civil liberty approach ( i.e andrew brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism ( eco-humanism ) , the argument that all ontological entities , animate and inanimate , can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist the work of arne næss and his collaborator sessions also falls under the libertarian extension , although they preferred the term '' deep ecology '' deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself peter singer 's work can be categorized under marshall 's 'libertarian extension ' he reasoned that the '' expanding circle of moral worth '' should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals , and to not do so would be guilty of speciesism peter singer : practical ethics however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic alan marshall 's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence of all biological ( and some abiological ) entities and their essential diversity whereas libertarian extension can be thought of as flowing from a political reflection of the natural world , ecologic extension is best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world ecological extension is roughly the same classification of smith 's eco-holism , and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity marshall 's category of 'conservation ethics ' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world peter singer advocated the preservation of '' world heritage sites , '' unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a '' scarcity value '' as they diminish over time the christian world view sees the universe as created by god , and humankind accountable to god for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind adeney : global ethics in new dictionary of christian ethics and pastoral theology 1995 leicester ) abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them ( see speciesism ) weak anthropocentrism , however , argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view , thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it instead , norton distinguishes between strong anthropocentrism and weak-or-extended-anthropocentrism and argues that the former must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world in germany , the university of greifswald has recently established an international program in landscape ecology & nature conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics

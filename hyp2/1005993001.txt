alan marshall and michael smith are two examples of this , as cited by peter vardy in '' the puzzle of ethics according to marshall , three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years : libertarian extension , the ecologic extension , and conservation ethics the work of arne næss and his collaborator sessions also falls under the libertarian extension , although they preferred the term '' deep ecology '' deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic whereas libertarian extension can be thought of as flowing from a political reflection of the natural world , ecologic extension is best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world ecological extension is roughly the same classification of smith 's eco-holism , and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity this category might include james lovelock 's gaia hypothesis ; the theory that the planet earth alters its geo-physiological structure over time in order to ensure the continuation of an equilibrium of evolving organic and inorganic matter marshall 's category of 'conservation ethics ' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world it contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology , ' hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology , ' and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings it could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by governments at the kyoto summit in 1997 and three agreements reached in the earth summit in 1992 the christian world view sees the universe as created by god , and humankind accountable to god for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind adeney : global ethics in new dictionary of christian ethics and pastoral theology 1995 leicester ) abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public , 1995 , 69-90 ; the use of abrahamic religious allusions assisted muir and the sierra club to create support for some of the first public nature preserves detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them ( see speciesism ) another point of view has been developed by bryan norton , who has become one of the essential actors of environmental ethics by launching environmental pragmatism , now one of its leading trends environmental pragmatism refuses to take a stance in disputes between defenders of anthropocentrist and non-anthropocentrist ethics humans can secure the future of life , and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose beginning in 2005 the department of philosophy and religion studies at the university of north texas offered a phd program with a concentration in environmental ethics/philosophy in 2009 , the university of munich and deutsches museum founded the rachel carson center for environment and society , an international , interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities center for environmental philosophy unt dept of philosophy creation care reading room : extensive online resources for environment and faith ( tyndale seminary ) category list -- - religion-online.org '' ecology/environment '' islam , christianity and the environment

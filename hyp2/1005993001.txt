according to marshall , three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years : libertarian extension , the ecologic extension , and conservation ethics andrew brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism ( eco-humanism ) , the argument that all ontological entities , animate and inanimate , can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist the work of arne næss and his collaborator sessions also falls under the libertarian extension , although they preferred the term '' deep ecology '' he reasoned that the '' expanding circle of moral worth '' should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals , and to not do so would be guilty of speciesism singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or '' non-sentient '' ( non-conscious ) entities , and concluded in his first edition of '' practical ethics '' that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth however , in a later edition of '' practical ethics '' after the work of næss and sessions , singer admits that , although unconvinced by deep ecology , the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible , but at best problematic alan marshall 's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence of all biological ( and some abiological ) entities and their essential diversity whereas libertarian extension can be thought of as flowing from a political reflection of the natural world , ecologic extension is best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world ecological extension is roughly the same classification of smith 's eco-holism , and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a whole entity marshall 's category of 'conservation ethics ' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world it contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology , ' hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology , ' and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings conservation is therefore a means to an end and purely concerned with mankind and inter-generational considerations peter singer advocated the preservation of '' world heritage sites , '' unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a '' scarcity value '' as they diminish over time their preservation is a bequest for future generations as they have been inherited from human 's ancestors and should be passed down to future generations so they can have the opportunity to decide whether to enjoy unspoilt countryside or an entirely urban landscape the christian world view sees the universe as created by god , and humankind accountable to god for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind environmental health ( deuteronomy 22.8 ; 23.12-14 ) - and dynamic motivation , the love of christ controlling ( 2 corinthians 5.14f ) and dealing with the underlying spiritual disease of sin , which shows itself in selfishness and thoughtlessness adeney : global ethics in new dictionary of christian ethics and pastoral theology 1995 leicester ) abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them ( see speciesism ) in particular , humans can continue sentient life that enjoys its existence , adding further motivation to propagate life in 2009 , the university of munich and deutsches museum founded the rachel carson center for environment and society , an international , interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities stanford university : ott , konrad ( 2020 ) : environmental ethics bioethics literature database brief history of environmental ethics thesaurus ethics in the life sciences envirolink library : environmental ethics - online resource for environmental ethics information envirolink forum - environmental ethics discussion/debate environmental ethics online ( journal , 1979-present ) sustainable and ethical architecture architectural firm stanford encyclopedia of philosophy environmental ethics entry in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy

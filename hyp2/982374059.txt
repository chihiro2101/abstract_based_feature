the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbr√ºcken , germany this shared track runs from gouda through alphen aan den rijn to leiden the existing heavy rail track was to bee adapted and seven additional stops added for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the province of south holland was in favour of this , but based on a referendum in march 2007 among the leiden population , the municipality was against it the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk the light-rail vehicles used were of the bombardier flexity swift model , produced in vienna in the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between gouda and alphen aan den rijn from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn the tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network , with branches to leiderdorp , the district of ridderfeld in alphen and schiphol the critics were in favour of extending the rail line from leiden to utrecht , and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from leiden to katwijk and noordwijk on the route leiden-katwijk/noordwijk the number of passengers would only be slightly higher than on the current bus network from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn the future rgl would then continue to leiden lammenschans railway station accordingly , the town rejected the rgl , but the province threatened to impose the tram line anyway the rgl noordwijk-binnen would run to voorhout station and the ns station at sassenheim in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles on 13 december 2009 , the trial ended and '' sprinter '' trains took over the line with the route through the hooigracht/langegracht in leiden decided ( 2008 ) , and the decision of the provincial government on the western route , the future of the rgl was a little clearer , but that did not mean that all obstacles have been overcome

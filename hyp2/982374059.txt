the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbr√ºcken , germany this shared track runs from gouda through alphen aan den rijn to leiden for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the province of south holland was in favour of this , but based on a referendum in march 2007 among the leiden population , the municipality was against it the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk in the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between gouda and alphen aan den rijn the stations were adapted by adding new low-level platforms , either as extensions to existing high-level platforms or by building them on the opposite side of the track to the high-level platforms from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn in the 1960s , 70s and 80s plan were often put forward for the tram to return to the previous sections of the blue and yellow tram the first ideas for the rgl were presented in the early 90s by boudewijn leeuwenburgh , the former district chief of nzh the tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network , with branches to leiderdorp , the district of ridderfeld in alphen and schiphol the critics were in favour of extending the rail line from leiden to utrecht , and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from leiden to katwijk and noordwijk despite the negative impact on the bus network in favor of the rgl it was expected that the accessibility of central leiden would be greatly improved eastern section ( gouda - alphen aan den rijn - leiden ) from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn from transferium 't schouw a44 , the rgl would go as light rail to katwijk aan den rijn , then fork into branches to katwijk aan zee and noordwijk respectively in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles in alphen aan den rijn a new 4lr wooden platform was built along the old freight track gouda alphen aan den rijn leiden katwijk randstadrail

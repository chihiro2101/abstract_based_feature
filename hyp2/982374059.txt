the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbr√ºcken , germany this shared track runs from gouda through alphen aan den rijn to leiden the existing heavy rail track was to bee adapted and seven additional stops added for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the province of south holland was in favour of this , but based on a referendum in march 2007 among the leiden population , the municipality was against it the province threatened to force the municipality to accept a trajectory through leiden the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk in the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between gouda and alphen aan den rijn from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn long before there was light rail , some of the tracks had tram traffic the tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network , with branches to leiderdorp , the district of ridderfeld in alphen and schiphol a track through the centre of leiden would mean that the travel time for people who have a destination outside leiden would be significantly longer , and this course had repercussions for the passenger forecast from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn the original plan was that the rgl should continue from leiden lammenschans railway station as a city tram to leiden central station in one of those alternatives the rgl would follow the existing route of the railway line all the way to leiden centraal , or to a point near the station the railway would be doubled , and perhaps be moved to a concrete overpass above the current track whereas the tram in the initial proposal would go through steenstraat/3e binnenvestgracht stationsweg to the station , it was to go through the lammermarkt and schuttersveld in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles gouda alphen aan den rijn leiden katwijk randstadrail

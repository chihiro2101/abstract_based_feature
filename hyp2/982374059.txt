the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbrücken , germany this shared track runs from gouda through alphen aan den rijn to leiden the existing heavy rail track was to bee adapted and seven additional stops added for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the province of south holland was in favour of this , but based on a referendum in march 2007 among the leiden population , the municipality was against it the province and municipality then agreed that the route would follow hooigracht and langegracht the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk in the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between gouda and alphen aan den rijn from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn long before there was light rail , some of the tracks had tram traffic the tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network , with branches to leiderdorp , the district of ridderfeld in alphen and schiphol the critics were in favour of extending the rail line from leiden to utrecht , and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from leiden to katwijk and noordwijk the most recent forecasts a ridership of 50,000 passengers — 42,000 more than in the busiest tram line in amsterdam ( number 5 ) from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn the future rgl would then continue to leiden lammenschans railway station therefore , in addition to the original plan several alternative plans were developed on 7 march 2007 a referendum was held in leiden , on the arrival of the rgl to leiden ( a specific route was not mentioned in the referendum question ) in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles gouda alphen aan den rijn leiden katwijk randstadrail

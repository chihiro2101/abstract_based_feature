the rgl would have been the first system in the netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains , similar to the tram-train systems around karlsruhe and saarbrücken , germany this shared track runs from gouda through alphen aan den rijn to leiden for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the province of south holland was in favour of this , but based on a referendum in march 2007 among the leiden population , the municipality was against it the province and municipality then agreed that the route would follow hooigracht and langegracht the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk the light-rail vehicles used were of the bombardier flexity swift model , produced in vienna in the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between gouda and alphen aan den rijn from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn completion depended on financial support from the national government , and in the autumn of 2009 , state secretary of transport tineke huizinga indicated that the line to katwijk would cost €45 million there were also suggestions to link the rgl to randstadrail , for example by establishing the trajectory of leiden-zoetermeer and/or leiden-leidschendam-voorburg via voorschoten the critics were in favour of extending the rail line from leiden to utrecht , and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from leiden to katwijk and noordwijk on the route leiden-katwijk/noordwijk the number of passengers would only be slightly higher than on the current bus network eastern section ( gouda - alphen aan den rijn - leiden ) from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn in one of those alternatives the rgl would follow the existing route of the railway line all the way to leiden centraal , or to a point near the station in both communities the tram line would have to be imposed by the provincial government , as had happened earlier in leiden in march 2003 test traffic was started between gouda and alphen aan den rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks , largely using rgl vehicles in august 2009 it was announced that the proposed precursor of the rgl on the gouda-alphen route would disappear as of 13 december 2009 , because using only sprinter the train timetables could be improved

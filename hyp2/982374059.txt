this shared track runs from gouda through alphen aan den rijn to leiden for leiden , the plan was to have new track through the centre ( breestraat ) at street level ( alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track , or in a tunnel through the centre ) the province threatened to force the municipality to accept a trajectory through leiden the province and municipality then agreed that the route would follow hooigracht and langegracht the proposed line passed through leiden centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to katwijk with a branch to noordwijk from 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from gouda to alphen aan den rijn long before there was light rail , some of the tracks had tram traffic in the 1990s it was projected that approximately 78,000 passengers a day would use the rgl ( total number for the system gouda-katwijk/noordwijk ) despite the negative impact on the bus network in favor of the rgl it was expected that the accessibility of central leiden would be greatly improved on the route leiden-katwijk/noordwijk the number of passengers would only be slightly higher than on the current bus network eastern section ( gouda - alphen aan den rijn - leiden ) from 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between gouda and alphen aan den rijn the future rgl would then continue to leiden lammenschans railway station in one of those alternatives the rgl would follow the existing route of the railway line all the way to leiden centraal , or to a point near the station from transferium 't schouw a44 , the rgl would go as light rail to katwijk aan den rijn , then fork into branches to katwijk aan zee and noordwijk respectively the rgl noordwijk-binnen would run to voorhout station and the ns station at sassenheim in both communities the tram line would have to be imposed by the provincial government , as had happened earlier in leiden these were bombardier a32s , a model that is also used on the tv√§rbanan light rail line in stockholm gouda alphen aan den rijn leiden katwijk randstadrail

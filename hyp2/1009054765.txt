prior to newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made , but most were essentially novelties university of rochester , ny , the growth of the steam engine online history resource , chapter one around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a coffee percolator century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the '' miner 's friend '' , the miners friend essentially identical to somerset 's design and almost certainly a direct copy the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow , so savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam a theoretical problem with savery 's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so , raised by steam pressure in savery 's pamphlet , he suggests setting the boiler and containers on a ledge in the mineshaft and even a series of two or more pumps for deeper levels the more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure , as demonstrated when thomas savery application of the engine , perhaps in 1705 the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston although the engine certainly worked as far as it went , it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got this far , papin never developed it further , although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by '' firetubes '' the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed the rod descended the mine shaft by gravity and drove a force pump , or pole pump ( or most often a gang of two ) inside the mineshaft the boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe this is generally accepted as the first successful newcomen engine and followed by one built a mile and a half east of wolverhampton both these were used by newcomen and his partner john calley to pump out water-filled coal mines another newcomen engine was in cornwall since savery 's patent had not yet run out , newcomen was forced to come to an arrangement with savery and operate under the latter 's patent , as its term was much longer than any newcomen could have easily obtained although its first use was in coal-mining areas , newcomen 's engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native west country , such as the tin mines of cornwall evidence of the use of a newcomen steam engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in midlothian , va ( site of some of the first coal mines in the us ) its name was derived from the noise it made when it operated to release the air and steam '' like a man snifting with a cold '' on the 1712 engine , the water feed pump was attached to the bottom of the plug tree , but later engines had the pump outside suspended from a separate small arch-head this was replaced by a newcomen engine in 1742â€“3 newcomen 's engine was only replaced when james watt improved it in 1769 to avoid this problem ( watt had been asked to repair a model of a newcomen engine by glasgow university ; a small model that exaggerated the problem ) in the watt steam engine , condensation took place in an exterior condenser unit , attached to the steam cylinder via a pipe levine , and alessandro nuvolari , do patents encourage or hinder innovation ? the case of the steam engine - there was a rush to install watt engines , and newcomen engines were eclipsed , even in collieries black country living museum : newcomen steam engine the 'fire engine ' as it was known , is an impressive brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall

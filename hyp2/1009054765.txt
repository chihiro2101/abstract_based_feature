prior to newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made , but most were essentially novelties university of rochester , ny , the growth of the steam engine online history resource , chapter one century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container a fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the '' miner 's friend '' , the miners friend essentially identical to somerset 's design and almost certainly a direct copy savery 's invention can not be strictly regarded as the first steam '' engine '' since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device such pumps were common already , powered by horses , but required a vertical reciprocating drive that savery 's system did not provide the more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure , as demonstrated when thomas savery application of the engine , perhaps in 1705 the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston although the engine certainly worked as far as it went , it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got this far , papin never developed it further , although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by '' firetubes '' the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed the suction stroke of the pump was only for the length of the upward ( priming ) stroke , there consequently was no longer the 30-foot restriction of a vacuum pump and water could be forced up a column from far greater depths the boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe making all this work needed the skill of a practical engineer ; newcomen 's trade as an '' ironmonger '' or metal merchant would have given him significant practical knowledge of what materials would be suitable for such an engine and brought him into contact with people having even more detailed knowledge this is generally accepted as the first successful newcomen engine and followed by one built a mile and a half east of wolverhampton since savery 's patent had not yet run out , newcomen was forced to come to an arrangement with savery and operate under the latter 's patent , as its term was much longer than any newcomen could have easily obtained evidence of the use of a newcomen steam engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in midlothian , va ( site of some of the first coal mines in the us ) installed high up in the engine house was a water tank c ( or header tank ) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head the pump equipment was heavier than the steam piston , so that the position of the beam at rest was pump-side down/engine-side up , which was called '' out of the house '' to start the engine , the regulator valve v was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler , filling the space beneath the piston this condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston steam was then readmitted to the cylinder , destroying the vacuum and driving the condensate down the sinking or '' eduction '' pipe the later watt engines worked lift pumps powered by the engine stroke and it may be that later versions of the newcomen engine did so too this was replaced by a newcomen engine in 1742â€“3 it also enabled the development of a double-acting cylinder , with both upwards and downwards power strokes , increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase in the size of the engine in 1986 , a full-scale operational replica of the 1712 newcomen steam engine was completed at the black country living museum in dudley black country living museum : newcomen steam engine the 'fire engine ' as it was known , is an impressive brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall

prior to newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made , but most were essentially novelties university of rochester , ny , the growth of the steam engine online history resource , chapter one around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a coffee percolator first a container was filled with water via a pipe , which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom the bottom of the pipe would be submerged in the water , making the container airtight the steam generated pressurized the container , but the inner pipe , immersed at the bottom by liquid , and lacking an airtight seal at top , remained at a lower pressure ; expanding steam forced the water at the bottom of the container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a nozzle on top in 1606 , the spaniard , jerónimo de ayanz y beaumont demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container a fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow , so savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam savery 's invention can not be strictly regarded as the first steam '' engine '' since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device a theoretical problem with savery 's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so , raised by steam pressure obviously these were inconvenient solutions and some sort of mechanical pump working at surface level – one that lifted the water directly instead of '' sucking '' it up – was desirable such pumps were common already , powered by horses , but required a vertical reciprocating drive that savery 's system did not provide papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water into the bottom of a vertical cylinder , inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston , placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed unlike savery 's device , pumping was entirely mechanical , the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the rocking beam the boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe this is generally accepted as the first successful newcomen engine and followed by one built a mile and a half east of wolverhampton since savery 's patent had not yet run out , newcomen was forced to come to an arrangement with savery and operate under the latter 's patent , as its term was much longer than any newcomen could have easily obtained although its first use was in coal-mining areas , newcomen 's engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native west country , such as the tin mines of cornwall as the low pressure steam from the boiler flowed into the cylinder , the weight of the pump and gear returned the beam to its initial position whilst at the same time driving the water up from the mine newcomen found that his first engine would stop working after a while , and eventually discovered that this was due to small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam use of the newcomen engine was extended in some places to pump municipal water supply ; for instance the first newcomen engine in france was built at passy in 1726 to pump water from the seine to the city of paris it also enabled the development of a double-acting cylinder , with both upwards and downwards power strokes , increasing amount of power from the engine without a great increase in the size of the engine a coal fire heats the water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated then passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above the boiler the steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move

prior to newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made , but most were essentially novelties around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a coffee percolator first a container was filled with water via a pipe , which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom in 1606 , the spaniard , jer√≥nimo de ayanz y beaumont demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container a fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the '' miner 's friend '' , the miners friend essentially identical to somerset 's design and almost certainly a direct copy the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow , so savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam savery 's invention can not be strictly regarded as the first steam '' engine '' since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device a theoretical problem with savery 's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so , raised by steam pressure the more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure , as demonstrated when thomas savery application of the engine , perhaps in 1705 it seems that the idea came to papin whilst working with robert boyle at the royal society in london the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston upon releasing the catch , the piston was sharply drawn down to the bottom of the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum ; enough force was thus generated to raise a weight although the engine certainly worked as far as it went , it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got this far , papin never developed it further , although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by '' firetubes '' the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed this is generally accepted as the first successful newcomen engine and followed by one built a mile and a half east of wolverhampton a working replica can today be seen at the nearby black country living museum , which stands on another part of what was lord dudley 's conygree park another newcomen engine was in cornwall the action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking beam engine , the lever e of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building , the engine being located in-house newcomen found that his first engine would stop working after a while , and eventually discovered that this was due to small amounts of air being admitted to the cylinder with the steam the urgent need for an engine to give rotary motion was making itself felt and this was done with limited success by wasborough and pickard using a newcomen engine to drive a flywheel through a crank this meant that a considerable amount of fuel was being used just to heat the cylinder back to the point where the steam would start to fill it again watt 's vigorous defence of his patents resulted in the continued use of the newcomen engine in an effort to avoid royalty payments levine , and alessandro nuvolari , do patents encourage or hinder innovation ? the case of the steam engine - there was a rush to install watt engines , and newcomen engines were eclipsed , even in collieries in 1986 , a full-scale operational replica of the 1712 newcomen steam engine was completed at the black country living museum in dudley the steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move

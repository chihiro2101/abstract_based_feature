prior to newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made , but most were essentially novelties university of rochester , ny , the growth of the steam engine online history resource , chapter one first a container was filled with water via a pipe , which extended through the top of the container to nearly the bottom the steam generated pressurized the container , but the inner pipe , immersed at the bottom by liquid , and lacking an airtight seal at top , remained at a lower pressure ; expanding steam forced the water at the bottom of the container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a nozzle on top in 1606 , the spaniard , jerónimo de ayanz y beaumont demonstrated and was granted a patent for a steam powered water pump century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container a fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow , so savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam a theoretical problem with savery 's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so , raised by steam pressure obviously these were inconvenient solutions and some sort of mechanical pump working at surface level – one that lifted the water directly instead of '' sucking '' it up – was desirable the more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure , as demonstrated when thomas savery application of the engine , perhaps in 1705 the fire was then removed , allowing the cylinder to cool , which condensed steam back into water , thus creating a vacuum beneath the piston to the end of the piston rod was attached a cord passing over two pulleys and a weight hung down from the cord 's end unlike savery 's device , pumping was entirely mechanical , the work of the steam engine being to lift a weighted rod slung from the opposite extremity of the rocking beam making all this work needed the skill of a practical engineer ; newcomen 's trade as an '' ironmonger '' or metal merchant would have given him significant practical knowledge of what materials would be suitable for such an engine and brought him into contact with people having even more detailed knowledge another newcomen engine was in cornwall since savery 's patent had not yet run out , newcomen was forced to come to an arrangement with savery and operate under the latter 's patent , as its term was much longer than any newcomen could have easily obtained during the latter years of its currency , the patent belonged to an unincorporated company , the proprietors of the invention for raising water by fire evidence of the use of a newcomen steam engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in midlothian , va ( site of some of the first coal mines in the us ) although based on simple principles , newcomen 's engine was rather complex and showed signs of incremental development , problems being empirically addressed as they arose the action of the engine was transmitted through a rocking beam engine , the lever e of which rested on the very solid end-gable wall of the purpose-built engine house with the pump side projecting outside of the building , the engine being located in-house the piston was surrounded by a seal in the form of a leather ring , but as the cylinder bore was finished by hand and not absolutely true , a layer of water had to be constantly maintained on top of the piston installed high up in the engine house was a water tank c ( or header tank ) fed by a small in-house pump slung from a smaller arch-head the later watt engines worked lift pumps powered by the engine stroke and it may be that later versions of the newcomen engine did so too this was replaced by a newcomen engine in 1742–3 the newcomen memorial engine can be seen operating in newcomen 's home town of dartmouth , where it was moved in 1963 by the newcomen society the steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move

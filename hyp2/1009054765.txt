prior to newcomen a number of small steam devices of various sorts had been made , but most were essentially novelties around 1600 a number of experimenters used steam to power small fountains working like a coffee percolator the bottom of the pipe would be submerged in the water , making the container airtight the steam generated pressurized the container , but the inner pipe , immersed at the bottom by liquid , and lacking an airtight seal at top , remained at a lower pressure ; expanding steam forced the water at the bottom of the container into and up the pipe to spurt out of a nozzle on top century of inventions one was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains ; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure two containers were alternately filled with steam , then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense ; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container a fresh charge of steam under pressure then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated in 1698 thomas savery patented a steam-powered pump he called the '' miner 's friend '' , the miners friend essentially identical to somerset 's design and almost certainly a direct copy the process of cooling and creating the vacuum was fairly slow , so savery later added an external cold water spray to quickly cool the steam savery 's invention can not be strictly regarded as the first steam '' engine '' since it had no moving parts and could not transmit its power to any external device a theoretical problem with savery 's device stemmed from the fact that a vacuum could only raise water to a maximum height of about ; to this could be added another , or so , raised by steam pressure obviously these were inconvenient solutions and some sort of mechanical pump working at surface level – one that lifted the water directly instead of '' sucking '' it up – was desirable such pumps were common already , powered by horses , but required a vertical reciprocating drive that savery 's system did not provide the more practical problem concerned having a boiler operating under pressure , as demonstrated when thomas savery application of the engine , perhaps in 1705 upon releasing the catch , the piston was sharply drawn down to the bottom of the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum ; enough force was thus generated to raise a weight the way forward was to provide , as savery had , a boiler capable of ensuring the continuity of the supply of steam to the cylinder , providing the vacuum power stroke by condensing the steam , and disposing of the water once it had been condensed the boiler supplied the steam at extremely low pressure and was at first located immediately beneath the power cylinder but could also be placed behind a separating wall with a connecting steam pipe this is generally accepted as the first successful newcomen engine and followed by one built a mile and a half east of wolverhampton another newcomen engine was in cornwall although its first use was in coal-mining areas , newcomen 's engine was also used for pumping water out of the metal mines in his native west country , such as the tin mines of cornwall evidence of the use of a newcomen steam engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in midlothian , va ( site of some of the first coal mines in the us ) although based on simple principles , newcomen 's engine was rather complex and showed signs of incremental development , problems being empirically addressed as they arose water usually contains some dissolved air , and boiling the water released this with the steam the later watt engines worked lift pumps powered by the engine stroke and it may be that later versions of the newcomen engine did so too use of the newcomen engine was extended in some places to pump municipal water supply ; for instance the first newcomen engine in france was built at passy in 1726 to pump water from the seine to the city of paris newcomen 's engine was only replaced when james watt improved it in 1769 to avoid this problem ( watt had been asked to repair a model of a newcomen engine by glasgow university ; a small model that exaggerated the problem ) in 1986 , a full-scale operational replica of the 1712 newcomen steam engine was completed at the black country living museum in dudley the steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move

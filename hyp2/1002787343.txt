in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam the solution to draining deep mines was found by thomas newcomen who developed an '' atmospheric '' engine that also worked on the vacuum principle it employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end at the bottom of each stroke , steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston as the piston rose within the cylinder , drawn upward by a counterbalance , it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam this water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston the atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder , thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder while newcomen engines brought practical benefits , they were inefficient in terms of the use of energy to power them the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate , condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder steam was drawn from the boiler to the cylinder under the piston external atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine this gave the watt engine greater efficiency than the newcomen engine , reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a newcomen engine the volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam , and was determined as seven times the volume of the condensed steam watt 's next improvement to the newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston , keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it the second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum on the other side of the piston this increased the efficiency of the engine , but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications , in particular pumping hulse david k ( 1999 ) : '' the early development of the steam engine '' ; tee publishing , leamington spa , u.k driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum raised the possibility of reciprocating engine development the oldest still in its original engine house and still capable of doing the job for which it was installed is the 1812 boulton and watt engine at the crofton pumping station the oldest extant rotative steam engine , the whitbread engine ( from 1785 , the third rotative engine ever built ) , is located in the powerhouse museum in sydney , australia watt atmospheric engine – michigan state university , chemical engineering watt 's 'perfect engine ' – excerpts from transactions of the newcomen society boulton & watt engine at the national museum of scotland boulton and watt steam engine at the powerhouse museum , sydney james watt steam engine act on the uk parliament website

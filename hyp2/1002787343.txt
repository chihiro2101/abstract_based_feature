in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam the solution to draining deep mines was found by thomas newcomen who developed an '' atmospheric '' engine that also worked on the vacuum principle it employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end at the bottom of each stroke , steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston as the piston rose within the cylinder , drawn upward by a counterbalance , it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam the atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder , thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder in the next fifty years only a few small changes were made to the engine design while newcomen engines brought practical benefits , they were inefficient in terms of the use of energy to power them the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate , condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder the condenser remained cold and below atmospheric pressure at all times , while the cylinder remained hot at all times steam was drawn from the boiler to the cylinder under the piston when the piston reached the top of the cylinder , the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine the condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder watt 's next improvement to the newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket the steam supply was cut during the stroke , and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side this increased the efficiency of the engine , but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications , in particular pumping watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum raised the possibility of reciprocating engine development an arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser this was effective in engines that were used for pumping water , but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull watt was also concerned with fundamental research on the functioning of the steam engine the oldest extant rotative steam engine , the whitbread engine ( from 1785 , the third rotative engine ever built ) , is located in the powerhouse museum in sydney , australia boulton & watt engine at the national museum of scotland boulton and watt steam engine at the powerhouse museum , sydney james watt steam engine act on the uk parliament website

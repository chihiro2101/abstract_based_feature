in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam the solution to draining deep mines was found by thomas newcomen who developed an '' atmospheric '' engine that also worked on the vacuum principle it employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end at the bottom of each stroke , steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston as the piston rose within the cylinder , drawn upward by a counterbalance , it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam this water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston the atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder , thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder the piston , attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the '' rocking beam '' , pulled down the end of the beam , lifting the opposite end of the beam in the next fifty years only a few small changes were made to the engine design the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate , condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder steam was drawn from the boiler to the cylinder under the piston the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine this gave the watt engine greater efficiency than the newcomen engine , reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a newcomen engine the condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder watt 's next improvement to the newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston , keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it the second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum on the other side of the piston the steam supply was cut during the stroke , and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side watt had tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain an accurately bored cylinder for his steam engines , and was forced to use hammered iron , which was out of round and caused leakage past the piston additional benefits of the double acting engine were increased efficiency , higher speed ( greater power ) and more regular motion to bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston , watt developed his parallel motion the oldest working engine in the world is the smethwick engine , brought into service in may 1779 and now at thinktank in birmingham ( formerly at the now defunct museum of science and industry , birmingham ) carnot cycle corliss steam engine heat engine thermodynamics preserved beam engines ivan polzunov made a powerful non-condensing steam engine in 1776 , but died before he could mass-produce it boulton & watt engine at the national museum of scotland boulton and watt steam engine at the powerhouse museum , sydney james watt steam engine act on the uk parliament website

the appliance was also proposed for draining mines , but it could only draw fluid up approximately 25 feet , meaning it had to be located within this distance of the mine floor being drained it also consumed a large amount of fuel compared with later engines the solution to draining deep mines was found by thomas newcomen who developed an '' atmospheric '' engine that also worked on the vacuum principle it employed a cylinder containing a movable piston connected by a chain to one end of a rocking beam that worked a mechanical lift pump from its opposite end at the bottom of each stroke , steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston as the piston rose within the cylinder , drawn upward by a counterbalance , it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam this water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston the atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder , thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke each charge of steam introduced would continue condensing until the cylinder approached working temperature once again because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate , condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder steam was drawn from the boiler to the cylinder under the piston when the piston reached the top of the cylinder , the steam inlet valve closed and the valve controlling the passage to the condenser opened external atmospheric pressure then pushed the piston down the cylinder the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine this gave the watt engine greater efficiency than the newcomen engine , reducing the amount of coal consumed while doing the same amount of work as a newcomen engine the volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam , and was determined as seven times the volume of the condensed steam watt 's next improvement to the newcomen design was to seal the top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston , keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it the steam supply was cut during the stroke , and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side hulse david k ( 1999 ) : '' the early development of the steam engine '' ; tee publishing , leamington spa , u.k hulse david k ( 2001 ) : '' the development of rotary motion by the steam power '' ; tee publishing , leamington spa , u.k an arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser watt was also concerned with fundamental research on the functioning of the steam engine carnot cycle corliss steam engine heat engine thermodynamics preserved beam engines ivan polzunov made a powerful non-condensing steam engine in 1776 , but died before he could mass-produce it boulton & watt engine at the national museum of scotland boulton and watt steam engine at the powerhouse museum , sydney james watt steam engine act on the uk parliament website

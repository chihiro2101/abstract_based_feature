in 1698 , the english mechanical designer thomas savery invented a pumping appliance that used steam to draw water directly from a well by means of a vacuum created by condensing steam the solution to draining deep mines was found by thomas newcomen who developed an '' atmospheric '' engine that also worked on the vacuum principle at the bottom of each stroke , steam was allowed to enter the cylinder below the piston as the piston rose within the cylinder , drawn upward by a counterbalance , it drew in steam at atmospheric pressure at the top of the stroke the steam valve was closed , and cold water was briefly injected into the cylinder as a means of cooling the steam this water condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum below the piston the atmospheric pressure outside the engine was then greater than the pressure within the cylinder , thereby pushing the piston into the cylinder the piston , attached to a chain and in turn attached to one end of the '' rocking beam '' , pulled down the end of the beam , lifting the opposite end of the beam the pump pushed , rather than pulled the column of water upward , hence it could lift water any distance the system of alternately sending jets of steam , then cold water into the cylinder meant that the walls of the cylinder were alternately heated , then cooled with each stroke in 1763 , james watt was working as instrument maker at the university of glasgow when he was assigned the job of repairing a model newcomen engine and noted how inefficient it was in 1765 , watt conceived the idea of equipping the engine with a separate condensation chamber , which he called a '' condenser '' because the condenser and the working cylinder were separate , condensation occurred without significant loss of heat from the cylinder the separation of the cylinder and condenser eliminated the loss of heat that occurred when steam was condensed in the working cylinder of a newcomen engine the condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder the volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam , and was determined as seven times the volume of the condensed steam steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston , keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it hulse david k ( 1999 ) : '' the early development of the steam engine '' ; tee publishing , leamington spa , u.k as fully developed , it used about 75 % less fuel than a similar newcomen one the first watt engines were atmospheric pressure engines , like the newcomen engine but with the condensation taking place separate from the cylinder an arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser before the development of the double acting piston , the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain , which meant that power could only be applied in one direction , by pulling this was effective in engines that were used for pumping water , but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull the oldest still in its original engine house and still capable of doing the job for which it was installed is the 1812 boulton and watt engine at the crofton pumping station file : grazebrook beam engine.jpg the 1817 engine in birmingham , england file:15 23 1056 ford museum.jpg watt atmospheric pump engine ( 1796 ) at the henry ford museum watt atmospheric engine – michigan state university , chemical engineering watt 's 'perfect engine ' – excerpts from transactions of the newcomen society boulton & watt engine at the national museum of scotland boulton and watt steam engine at the powerhouse museum , sydney james watt steam engine act on the uk parliament website

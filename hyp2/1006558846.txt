'' ( a contraction of '' let 's go '' ) when rushed or excited and '' g ' h ! '' when he is startled or learns something that feeds into his paranoid nature however , he openly admits that he completely trusts his friends ( particularly hank ) , even more than himself , and in cases where he does realize the full impact of his actions , he can be surprisingly self-sacrificing when he and his friends became volunteer firemen , he secretly switched his full oxygen tank with hank 's low-running one just before putting out a fire dale also typically comes to wrong conclusions about actual events ; a running gag in the show is dale being unaware of nancy cheating on him , despite walking in on her and john redcorn moreover , he typically thinks most events that occur to him are motivated , malicious acts against him and not accidents , such as when hank cuts off dale 's finger by accident using his circular saw and dale becomes convinced that hank meant to injure him according to a high ranking manitoba president , dale should have died by now , having smoked over 991,863 cigarettes ( essentially 90 cigarettes per day ) , enough to earn every item in the manitoba catalog dale remembers when hank was a smoker and even is thrilled when hank re-lapses '' dale also refuses to pay taxes , does not vote at all ( '' the perils of polling '' ) , and occasionally prints his own currency ( hank hill typically appearing on the hundred-gribble bill , according to hank in '' mega-lo dale '' ) dale runs his own extermination business , dale 's dead-bug , although he generally does not pay taxes on his income and has filled out an income tax form only once he regularly makes insults behind her back ( usually about her appearance ) to hank 's face , and makes no real attempt to hide it from anyone she attempts to be the one to tell dale of nancy 's infidelities and of hank 's harboring dale 's temporarily stolen lawn-mower in the episode '' peggy 's gone to pots , '' rusty shackleford is revealed to be a real person after showing up on dale 's doorstep dale used the alias of central american singing sensation lamotil when he was in mexico for the elections in the episode '' the perils of polling ''

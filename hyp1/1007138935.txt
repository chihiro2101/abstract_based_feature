sabbateans who remained jews image : shabbatai2.jpg thumb right sabbatai zevi '' enthroned '' as the jewish messiah , from tikkun , amsterdam , 1666 in jewish history , many jews after sabbatai zevi 's feigned apostasy , although horrified , clung to the belief that zevi could still be regarded as the true jewish messiah by the 19th century , jewish sabbateans had been reduced to small groups of hidden followers who feared being discovered for their beliefs , that were deemed to be entirely heretical and antithetical to rabbinic judaism these very jews fell under the category of '' sectarian '' sabbateans , which originated when many sabbateans refused to accept that zevi 's feigned apostasy might have been indicative of the fact that their faith was genuinely an illusion another large group of sabbateans succeeding zevi 's feigned apostasy began to view islam in an extremely negative light criticism of islam erupted directly after zevi 's forced conversion accusations coming from anti-sabbatean jews revolved around the idea that sabbatai zevi 's feigned conversion to islam was rightfully an indicator of a false claim of messianship . sabbatai zevi 's conversion to islam many within zevi 's inner circle followed him into islam , including his wife sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends nathan of gaza , the scholar closest to zevi , who had caused zevi to reveal his messiahship and in turn became his prophet , never followed his master into islam but remained a jew , albeit excommunicated by his jewish brethren claims of ties between sabbatean kabbalah and sufism go back to the days of sabbatai zevi.2 this is largely based on the contention that zevi 's exile in the balkans brought him into close contact with several forms of unorthodox sufism which existed in the region the often claimed connection between the movement and bektashi order relies merely on circumstantial evidence and coincidence rather than any concrete substantiation inside the ottoman empire , those followers of zevi who had converted to islam but who secretly continued jewish observances and brit mila became known as the dönme '' convert '' ) emden was known for his attacks directed against the adherents , or those he supposed to be adherents , of sabbatai zevi emden 's assertion of heresy was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by eybeschutz , in which emden professed to see sabbatean allusions the controversy was a momentous incident in jewish history of the period , involving both yechezkel landau and the vilna gaon , and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in sabbatai current even in some orthodox circles related to this is the drive of the donmeh in turkey for secularizing their society just as european jews promoted the values of age of enlightenment and its jewish equivalent the haskalah rabbi aaron lapapa ( 1590–1674 ) was the rabbi at smyrna in 1665 , when zevi 's movement was at its height there zevi and his adherents retorted by deposing him and forcing him to leave the city , and his office was given to his colleague , hayyim benveniste , at that time one of sabbatai 's followers rabbi tzvi ashkenazi ( 1656–1718 ) known as the chacham tzvi , for some time rabbi of amsterdam , was a resolute opponent of the followers of sabbatai zevi

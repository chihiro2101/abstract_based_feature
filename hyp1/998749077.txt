'' nachmanides '' ( ναχμανίδης ) is a greek-influenced formation meaning '' son of nahman '' he is also commonly known by the hebrew acronym ( ra-m-ba-n , for r abbeinu m ōšeh b ēn- n āḥmān , '' our rabbi moses son of nahman '' ) ramban was born in girona in 1194 , where he grew up and studied ( hence he is also called mosheh ben nahman gerondi , or '' moses son of nahman the gironan '' ) , and died in the land of israel about 1270 in the view of nachmanides , the wisdom of the rabbis of the mishnah and talmud , as well as the geonim ( rabbis of the early medieval era ) was unquestionable '' we bow , '' he says , '' before them , and even when the reason for their words is not quite evident to us , we submit to them '' ( aseifat zekkenim , commentary on ketubot ) nachmanides ' adherence to the words of the rishonim may be due to piety , or the influence of the northern french jewish school of thought however , it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of greek philosophy among the jews of spain and provence ; this occurred soon after the appearance of maimonides ' guide for the perplexed against this tendency nachmanides strove , and went to the other extreme , not even allowing the utterances of the immediate disciples of the geonim to be questioned called upon , about 1238 , for support by solomon ben abraham of montpellier , who had been excommunicated by supporters of maimonides , nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of aragon , navarre , and castile , in which solomon 's adversaries were severely rebuked as to maimonides ' guide for the perplexed , nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief , but for those who had been led astray by the non-jewish philosophical works of aristotle and galen however , modern scholarship attributes it to a different author , perhaps rabbi joseph ben abraham gikatilla , nachmanides sharply criticizes writers who strove to render man indifferent to both pleasure and pain for nachmanides , divine revelation is the best guide in all these questions , and proceeds to give his views on jewish eschatology ramban 's commentary on the torah ( five books of moses ) was his last work , and his most well known his exposition , intermingled with aggadah and kabbalah interpretations , is based upon careful philology and original study of the bible his commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance : as in his preceding works , he vehemently attacks the greek philosophy , especially aristotle , and frequently criticizes maimonides ' biblical interpretations next to belief in miracles nachmanides places three other beliefs , which are , according to him , the jewish principles of faith , namely , the belief in creationism , in the omniscience of god , and in divine providence over time , nachmanides updated his commentary in at least 250 places , particularly after moving from spain to the land of israel nachmanides , first as rabbi of girona and later as chief rabbi of catalonia , seems to have led a largely untroubled life when well advanced in years , however , his life was interrupted by an event which made him leave his family and his country and wander in foreign lands nachmanides countered that christiani 's interpretations were distortions ; the rabbis would not hint that jesus was messiah while , at the same time , explicitly opposing him as such as the disputation seemed to turn in favor of nachmanides , the jews of barcelona , fearing the resentment of the dominicans , entreated him to discontinue ; but the king , whom nachmanides had acquainted with the apprehensions of the jews , desired him to proceed nachmanides then settled at acre , where he was very active in spreading jewish learning , which was at that time very much neglected in the holy land it was to arouse the interest of the israeli jews in the exposition of the bible that nachmanides wrote the greatest of his works , the above-mentioned commentary on the torah shortly after his arrival in jerusalem , he addressed a letter to his son nahman , in which he described the desolation of the holy city , where there were at that time only two jewish inhabitants—brothers , dyers by trade nachmanides ' writings in the defense of simeon kayyara and alfasi also belong in the category of his talmudic and halachic works

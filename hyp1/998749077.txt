'' nachmanides '' ( ναχμανίδης ) is a greek-influenced formation meaning '' son of nahman '' he is also commonly known by the hebrew acronym ( ra-m-ba-n , for r abbeinu m ōšeh b ēn- n āḥmān , '' our rabbi moses son of nahman '' ) his catalan name was bonastruc ça porta ( also written saporta or de porta ) , literally '' mazel tov near the gate '' ramban was born in girona in 1194 , where he grew up and studied ( hence he is also called mosheh ben nahman gerondi , or '' moses son of nahman the gironan '' ) , and died in the land of israel about 1270 nachmanides ' adherence to the words of the rishonim may be due to piety , or the influence of the northern french jewish school of thought however , it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of greek philosophy among the jews of spain and provence ; this occurred soon after the appearance of maimonides ' guide for the perplexed against this tendency nachmanides strove , and went to the other extreme , not even allowing the utterances of the immediate disciples of the geonim to be questioned called upon , about 1238 , for support by solomon ben abraham of montpellier , who had been excommunicated by supporters of maimonides , nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of aragon , navarre , and castile , in which solomon 's adversaries were severely rebuked however , the great respect he professed for maimonides ( though he did not share the latter 's views ) , reinforced by innate gentleness of character , kept him from allying himself with the anti-maimonist party and led him to assume the role of a conciliator as to maimonides ' guide for the perplexed , nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief , but for those who had been led astray by the non-jewish philosophical works of aristotle and galen the book iggeret ha-kodesh ( אגרת הקודש - the holy epistle ) on the topics of marriage , holiness , and sexual relations was commonly attributed to nachmanides , who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift in this book , the author criticizes maimonides for stigmatizing man 's sexual nature as a disgrace to man in the view of the author , the body with all its functions being the work of god , is holy , and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable for nachmanides , divine revelation is the best guide in all these questions , and proceeds to give his views on jewish eschatology besides the animal soul , which is derived from the '' supreme powers '' and is common to all creatures , man possesses a special soul through the medium of man it enters the material life ; and at the dissolution of its medium it either returns to its original source or enters the body of another man this belief is , according to nachmanides , the basis of the levirate marriage , the child of which inherits not only the name of the brother of his fleshly father , but also his soul , and thus continues its existence on the earth ramban 's commentary on the torah ( five books of moses ) was his last work , and his most well known his commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance : as in his preceding works , he vehemently attacks the greek philosophy , especially aristotle , and frequently criticizes maimonides ' biblical interpretations next to belief in miracles nachmanides places three other beliefs , which are , according to him , the jewish principles of faith , namely , the belief in creationism , in the omniscience of god , and in divine providence over time , nachmanides updated his commentary in at least 250 places , particularly after moving from spain to the land of israel nachmanides , first as rabbi of girona and later as chief rabbi of catalonia , seems to have led a largely untroubled life relying upon the reserve his adversary would be forced to exercise due to fear of offending the feelings of the christians , pablo assured the king that he would prove the truth of christianity from the talmud and other rabbinical writings shortly after his arrival in jerusalem , he addressed a letter to his son nahman , in which he described the desolation of the holy city , where there were at that time only two jewish inhabitants—brothers , dyers by trade in another , addressed to his second son , who occupied an official position at the castilian court , nachmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality nachmanides ' writings in the defense of simeon kayyara and alfasi also belong in the category of his talmudic and halachic works

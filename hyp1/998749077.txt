'' nachmanides '' ( ναχμανίδης ) is a greek-influenced formation meaning '' son of nahman '' he is also commonly known by the hebrew acronym ( ra-m-ba-n , for r abbeinu m ōšeh b ēn- n āḥmān , '' our rabbi moses son of nahman '' ) his catalan name was bonastruc ça porta ( also written saporta or de porta ) , literally '' mazel tov near the gate '' ramban was born in girona in 1194 , where he grew up and studied ( hence he is also called mosheh ben nahman gerondi , or '' moses son of nahman the gironan '' ) , and died in the land of israel about 1270 bar ilan cd-rom he was a descendant of isaac ben reuben of barcelona and cousin of jonah gerondi ( rabbeinu yonah ) in the view of nachmanides , the wisdom of the rabbis of the mishnah and talmud , as well as the geonim ( rabbis of the early medieval era ) was unquestionable however , it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of greek philosophy among the jews of spain and provence ; this occurred soon after the appearance of maimonides ' guide for the perplexed against this tendency nachmanides strove , and went to the other extreme , not even allowing the utterances of the immediate disciples of the geonim to be questioned called upon , about 1238 , for support by solomon ben abraham of montpellier , who had been excommunicated by supporters of maimonides , nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of aragon , navarre , and castile , in which solomon 's adversaries were severely rebuked however , the great respect he professed for maimonides ( though he did not share the latter 's views ) , reinforced by innate gentleness of character , kept him from allying himself with the anti-maimonist party and led him to assume the role of a conciliator as to maimonides ' guide for the perplexed , nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief , but for those who had been led astray by the non-jewish philosophical works of aristotle and galen ( note that nachmanides 's analysis of the guide is not the consensus view of modern scholars the book iggeret ha-kodesh ( אגרת הקודש - the holy epistle ) on the topics of marriage , holiness , and sexual relations was commonly attributed to nachmanides , who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift however , modern scholarship attributes it to a different author , perhaps rabbi joseph ben abraham gikatilla in the view of the author , the body with all its functions being the work of god , is holy , and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable it derides the presumption of the philosophers who pretend to a knowledge of the essence of god and the angels , while even the composition of their own bodies is a mystery to them for nachmanides , divine revelation is the best guide in all these questions , and proceeds to give his views on jewish eschatology this reward and punishment must take place in another world , for the good and evil of this world are relative and transitory this belief is , according to nachmanides , the basis of the levirate marriage , the child of which inherits not only the name of the brother of his fleshly father , but also his soul , and thus continues its existence on the earth his exposition , intermingled with aggadah and kabbalah interpretations , is based upon careful philology and original study of the bible instead , maimonides takes a rationalist approach that , because angels are incorporeal , they do not consume food like ordinary man , and thus it only '' appeared '' that they were eating , or that abraham had a prophetic vision of the angels eating next to belief in miracles nachmanides places three other beliefs , which are , according to him , the jewish principles of faith , namely , the belief in creationism , in the omniscience of god , and in divine providence furthermore , nachmanides demonstrated from numerous biblical and talmudic sources that traditional jewish belief ran contrary to christiani 's postulates he may also have been fined , but this was lifted as a favor to benveniste ça porta , who according to some authorities graetz , geschichte der juden vol nachmanides then settled at acre , where he was very active in spreading jewish learning , which was at that time very much neglected in the holy land nachmanides ' writings in the defense of simeon kayyara and alfasi also belong in the category of his talmudic and halachic works

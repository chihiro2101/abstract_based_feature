'' nachmanides '' ( ναχμανίδης ) is a greek-influenced formation meaning '' son of nahman '' he is also commonly known by the hebrew acronym ( ra-m-ba-n , for r abbeinu m ōšeh b ēn- n āḥmān , '' our rabbi moses son of nahman '' ) his catalan name was bonastruc ça porta ( also written saporta or de porta ) , literally '' mazel tov near the gate '' ramban was born in girona in 1194 , where he grew up and studied ( hence he is also called mosheh ben nahman gerondi , or '' moses son of nahman the gironan '' ) , and died in the land of israel about 1270 during his teens he began to get a reputation as a learned jewish scholar in the view of nachmanides , the wisdom of the rabbis of the mishnah and talmud , as well as the geonim ( rabbis of the early medieval era ) was unquestionable however , it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of greek philosophy among the jews of spain and provence ; this occurred soon after the appearance of maimonides ' guide for the perplexed called upon , about 1238 , for support by solomon ben abraham of montpellier , who had been excommunicated by supporters of maimonides , nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of aragon , navarre , and castile , in which solomon 's adversaries were severely rebuked as to maimonides ' guide for the perplexed , nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief , but for those who had been led astray by the non-jewish philosophical works of aristotle and galen the book iggeret ha-kodesh ( אגרת הקודש - the holy epistle ) on the topics of marriage , holiness , and sexual relations was commonly attributed to nachmanides , who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift in the view of the author , the body with all its functions being the work of god , is holy , and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable in nachmanides 's torat ha-adam , which deals with mourning rites , burial customs , etc through the medium of man it enters the material life ; and at the dissolution of its medium it either returns to its original source or enters the body of another man this belief is , according to nachmanides , the basis of the levirate marriage , the child of which inherits not only the name of the brother of his fleshly father , but also his soul , and thus continues its existence on the earth the resurrection spoken of by the prophets , which will take place after the coming of the messiah , is referred by nachmanides to the body his exposition , intermingled with aggadah and kabbalah interpretations , is based upon careful philology and original study of the bible his commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance : as in his preceding works , he vehemently attacks the greek philosophy , especially aristotle , and frequently criticizes maimonides ' biblical interpretations next to belief in miracles nachmanides places three other beliefs , which are , according to him , the jewish principles of faith , namely , the belief in creationism , in the omniscience of god , and in divine providence nachmanides , first as rabbi of girona and later as chief rabbi of catalonia , seems to have led a largely untroubled life christiani argued , based upon several aggadah passages , that the pharisee sages believed that the messiah had lived during the talmudic period , and that they ostensibly believed that the messiah was therefore jesus furthermore , nachmanides demonstrated from numerous biblical and talmudic sources that traditional jewish belief ran contrary to christiani 's postulates & nbsp ; 494 believe that the identification of bonastruc ça porta with nachmanides is incorrect his re-establishment of jewish communal life in jerusalem ( which had been interrupted by crusades repression ) is notable in that it marked the beginning of almost 700 consecutive jewish years in jerusalem until the 1948 arab–israeli war it was to arouse the interest of the israeli jews in the exposition of the bible that nachmanides wrote the greatest of his works , the above-mentioned commentary on the torah nachmanides ' wrote glosses on the whole talmud , made compendiums of parts of jewish law , after the model of isaac alfasi nachmanides ' writings in the defense of simeon kayyara and alfasi also belong in the category of his talmudic and halachic works

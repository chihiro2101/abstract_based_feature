linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct paradigms though they developed sequentially , all three paradigms are still practiced today language as culture in u.s anthropology : three paradigms the themes include : grammatical description , linguistic typology and linguistic relativity second paradigm : linguistic anthropology the second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology , signalling a more anthropological focus on the study this term was preferred by dell hymes , who was also responsible , with john gumperz , for the idea of ethnography of communication the term linguistic anthropology reflected hymes ' vision for the future , where language would be studied in the context of the situation , and relative to the community speaking it this new era would involve many new technological developments , such as mechanical recording hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology , the first of which was a new unit of analysis unlike the first paradigm , which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of phonemes and morphemes , the second paradigm 's unit of analysis was the '' speech event '' a speech event is an event defined by speech occurring during it ( ex hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology however , hymes ' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology the third paradigm , which began in the late 1980s , refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues rather than focusing on exploring language , third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above : documentation of languages , study of language through context , and study of identity through linguistic means a great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural identity linguistically and discursively linguistic anthropologist don kulick has done so in relation to identity , for example , in a series of settings , first in a village called gapun in northern papua new

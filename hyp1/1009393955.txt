linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct paradigms though they developed sequentially , all three paradigms are still practiced today language as culture in u.s anthropology : three paradigms current anthropology 44 ( 3 ) :323–348 . first paradigm : anthropological linguistics the field is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline : documentation of languages that were then seen as doomed to extinction , with special focus on the languages of native north american tribes the themes include : grammatical description , linguistic typology and linguistic relativity second paradigm : linguistic anthropology the second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology , signalling a more anthropological focus on the study this term was preferred by dell hymes , who was also responsible , with john gumperz , for the idea of ethnography of communication this new era would involve many new technological developments , such as mechanical recording hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology , the first of which was a new unit of analysis unlike the first paradigm , which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of phonemes and morphemes , the second paradigm 's unit of analysis was the '' speech event '' hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to ethnopoetics however , hymes ' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology . third paradigm : anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data the third paradigm , which began in the late 1980s , refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues rather than focusing on exploring language , third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above : documentation of languages , study of language through context , and study of identity through linguistic means a great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural identity linguistically and discursively linguistic anthropologist don kulick has done so in relation to identity , for example , in a series of settings , first in a village called gapun in northern papua new guinea language shift and cultural reproduction : socialization , self and syncretism in a papua new guinea village albuquerque : school of american research , university of new mexico press to speak the taiap language is associated with one identity : not only local but '' backward '' and also an identity based on the display of hed ( personal autonomy ) discourse studies , 7 ( 4–5 ) , 585–614 new york , ny , us : cambridge university press ( among many others ) have contributed to understandings of identity as '' intersubjectivity '' by examining the ways it is discursively constructed culture and language development : language acquisition and language socialization in a samoan village they discovered that the processes of enculturation and socialization do not occur apart from the process of language acquisition , but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process creating

, and culture , university of california , los angeles , 2006 pastors have introduced new ways of conveying knowledge , new linguistic epistemic markers —and new ways of speaking about time language structure and linguistic ideology silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere false consciousness but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures , including the dropping of '' thee '' and '' thou '' from everyday english usage kroskrity , paul v in language ideologies : practice and theory other linguists have carried out research in the areas of language contact , language endangerment , and 'english as a global language ' more recently , a new line of ideology work is beginning to enter the field of linguistics in relation to heritage language '' discourse , ideology and heritage language socialization : micro and macro perspectives '' although this is arguably a fledgling line of language ideology research , this work is poised to contribute to the understanding of how ideologies of language operate in a variety of settings he feels , in fact , that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology 's three most important

strategies in a transnational context the revitalization efforts can take the form of teaching the language to new speakers or encouraging the continued use within the community encouraging those who already know the language to use it , increasing the domains of usage , and increasing the overall prestige of the language are all components of reclamation

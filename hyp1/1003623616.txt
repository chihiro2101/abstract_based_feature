a subdeacon or hypodeacon is the highest of the minor orders of clergy in the eastern orthodox church this is symbolic of his suppression of his own tastes , will , and desires , and his canonical obedience to god , his bishop , and the liturgical and canonical norms of the church as a concession in countries where eastern orthodoxy is little known , many only wear the cassock when attending services or when moving about the faithful on church business there is a special service for the tonsuring of a subdeacon , although in contemporary practice an acolyte or a reader may receive the bishop 's blessing to vest and act as a subdeacon generally or for a particular occasion if there is no subdeacon available this situation often arises if there is a need for a subdeacon and a likely candidate has stated an intention to marry but has not yet done so , causing a delay in his ordination in the byzantine rite , ( followed by the majority of eastern orthodox churches ) , the subdeacon 's liturgy role is primarily that of servant to the bishop in addition to the above duties , the subdeacon may read the reading from the epistle at the divine liturgy if there is only one deacon the subdeacon also has practical responsibilities in the care of the altar , by cleaning it , looking after the clergy vestments and the cloths of the holy table , cleaning and mending them , and changing them according to the feasts , fasts , and seasons many wear the cassock only when present among the church community or attending to church business the new subdeacon kisses the bishop 's right hand and makes a prostration before the bishop , after which the more senior subdeacons drape a towel over his shoulders and present him with a ewer and basin , with which he washes the bishop 's hands after the usual manner the bishop dries his hands and the three subdeacons receive the bishop 's blessing and kiss his hands the subdeacon remains on the solea until the cherubikon , when he and two senior subdeacons wash the bishop 's hands as usual at pontifical services ( services at which a pontiff or bishop is present and presiding ) , the subdeacon also assists the deacon in the vesting of the bishop unlike his brother subdeacons in the byzantine rite who wear the orar , the western rite subdeacon does not wear its western equivalent - the stole - which is reserved for deacons , priests , and bishops in the eastern catholic churches which use the byzantine rite , the order of subdeacon is the highest of the minor orders and its functions are equivalent to those of orthodox subdeacons in practice , an anglican subdeacon performs similar roles to those performed in latin rite catholic or western rite orthodox churches

mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers ( about 1.6 square miles ) and has over 4000 structures , most of them residences , packed into this compound within the city walls the stone perimeter wall has twelve gates , including seven major gates with vaulted entrances the ceremonial center of the site is located in square q of the city 's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure the ceremonial center has a tightly packed cluster of temples , colonnaded halls , oratories , shrines , sanctuaries , altars , and platforms ( for oration , dancing , or stela display ) smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall , revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities for example , most or all of the vaulted roofs in mayapan have collapsed , while many of the better-built buildings at chichen itza remain intact unlike chichen itza , mayapan has no ballcourts the extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures , with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer the houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards lanes wind among the residences and walls the residential areas of the site contain many cenotes , perhaps as many as 40 the lords divided the towns of yucatán among them , and chose the chief of the cocom family as their leader the ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of mayapan ( roys 1962 ) another family , the xiu , may have been living in the mayapan area prior to the arrival of the cocom ; the xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from uxmal below the two primary officials were many other officials with varying responsibilities the social climate of mayapan was made complicated by the antagonistic relationship between the factions of nobles , which were often arranged by kinship ( pugh 2009 ; milbrath 2003 ) stephens was the first to document parts of the mayapan site with two important illustrations the first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by r.t the final report was published by the carnegie institution as mayapan , yucatan , mexico , by h several years later , the national institute of anthropology and history ( inah ) of mexico began extensive architectural excavations and consolidation under the direction of archaeologist carlos peraza lope marilyn masson from the state university new york at albany , carlos peraza lope of inah , and timothy s this '' economic foundations of mayapan '' ( pemy ) project performed mapping , surface survey and collection , test-pitting , and horizontal excavation across the city some evidence suggests overlapping occupation of the area by different cultures : in an alley fill between the templo redondo and an adjoining hall , some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540–820 b.c the burial appeared to be a secondary interment , and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall there was no pottery with the burial ; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots : charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to a.d researchers think that this sample is not associated with the context in which it was found the construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age however , two of these dates come from inexact sources one was burned copal found in an unknown structure ( apparently the label had eroded off of the structure ) ; the researchers inferred that it was q-95 the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history mayapan 's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time ; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins the fall of the city is tentatively dated around a.d 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse there is evidence that the area around mayapan was regularly used for slash-and-burn agriculture cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area , making them essential to support agriculture today farmers use mixed fields , called the milpa fields , to cultivate maize , beans , squash , watermelons , mangoes , papayas and other crops also , citrus fruit such as oranges and limes are often grown within the domestic house groups of the local residents ( russell 2008:16 ) these percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize in the settlement zone , researchers found : white-tailed deer ( 8.4 % ) , dog ( 1.4 % ) , turkey ( 5.3 % ) , iguana ( 14.5 % ) , and fish ( 3.6 % ) they concluded that the fish were being traded into mayapan , and not collected near the site mayapan was a major capital in the yucatán , and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes , as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region also , tiny “ dwarf ” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at mayapan the two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time ; which may suggest a connection between their governments architectural and artifact connections are seen between mayapan and the utatlan in highland guatemala the east coast sites exported products such as cotton , salt , and honey from the yucatán el chayal in guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at mayapan there are many similarities between the murals in mayapan and the art and iconography of the aztec and mixteca-puebla regions , carlos peraza lope , miguel delgado kú , carlos peraza lope , miguel delgado kú 2010 ) ( milbrath 2009:583 ) there are also depictions of the monkey-man god most of the iconography in mayapan is found either in murals on the temple walls , stone carving , or carved stone covered in plaster the east was associated with : life , males , and heat ; whereas the west was associated with : death , females , and cold this has led many sources to believe that the itza and the xiw may have been associated with east and west there was very little evidence for obvious separation of residence between classes peraza lope , carlos 1998 mayapán : ciudad-capital del postclasico ledyard smith ( 1962 ) '' residential and associated structures at mayapán '' , in mayapán yucatan mexico , edited by h.e.d

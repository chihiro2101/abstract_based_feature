mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers ( about 1.6 square miles ) and has over 4000 structures , most of them residences , packed into this compound within the city walls built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions the wall is 9.1 & nbsp ; km ( about 5.65 miles ) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner the ceremonial center of the site is located in square q of the city 's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people his survey results are posted online at www.mayapanperiphery.net people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities for example , most or all of the vaulted roofs in mayapan have collapsed , while many of the better-built buildings at chichen itza remain intact the extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures , with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer the houses are often arranged in small patio groups surrounding small courtyards settlement was the most dense in the southwestern part of the city where cenotes are more numerous the ethnohistorical sources recount multiple different histories of the rise and fall of mayapan ( roys 1962 ) these histories are often confusing , chronologically implausible , and difficult to reconcile for example , some sources say that the maya revolted in 1221 against the maya-toltec lords of chichen itza the new city was built within a defensive wall and named mayapan , meaning '' standard of the maya people '' mexican mercenaries from tabasco were also employed to keep order and maintain power though mayapan was ruled by a council , the jalach winik and the aj k ’ in ( the highest ruler , and the high priest ) dominated the political sphere excavation has revealed burnt roof beams in several of the major buildings in the site center stephens was the first to document parts of the mayapan site with two important illustrations the first was of the q-152 round temple , and the second was of the pyramid of kukulkan he was the first in a long string of explorers who drew the ruins of mayapan the first large-scale archeological site surveys were not conducted until 1938 by r.t these surveys mapped the main plaza group and the city wall , and were the basis of later maps ( russell 2008 ) smith , and tatiana proskouriakoff ( 1962 , publication 619 ) robert smith published a two-volume monograph on the pottery of mayapan in 1971 ( papers of the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology 66 , harvard university ) it has resulted in the discovery of many important artifacts , murals , stuccoes , and architectural elements from 2001 to 2009 , further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of dr this '' economic foundations of mayapan '' ( pemy ) project performed mapping , surface survey and collection , test-pitting , and horizontal excavation across the city according to robert smith , the ceramicist for the carnegie institution , there were two ceramic phases in mayapan : hocaba , which he said started around a.d 1200 and may have included types named mama red and navula unslipped , more commonly associated with southern lowland settlements : in an alley fill between the templo redondo and an adjoining hall , some charcoal was found that yielded a calibrated date of 540–820 b.c there was no pottery with the burial ; midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots : charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to a.d three separate samples form the frame for early mayapan occupation the fall of the city is tentatively dated around a.d diego de landa calderon , yucatán before and after the conquest , 1937 ( reprinted in 2008 ) see : abridged history of yucatan , pp yucatán before and after the conquest , by diego de landa ledyard smith , publication 619 : carnegie institution of washington , washington , d.c cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area , making them essential to support agriculture a study done by m.a these percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites , but they were consumed in small amounts ( less than 1.5 % ) while excavating , the researchers noted many fish skeletons , but few fish heads within the ceremonial center , numerous deer heads and teeth were found among the remains mayapan was a major capital in the yucatán , and there is extensive evidence that it had far-reaching trade routes , as seen in architecture and artifacts of other settlements in the region a wide variety of goods were traded , including maize , honey , salt , fish , game , cloth , and birds topoxte in lake yaxha , peten also shares similarities of architecture and artifacts of effigy censers architectural and artifact connections are seen between mayapan and the utatlan in highland guatemala this region also shows apparent influence of mayapan , in similar temple assemblages , similarities in architecture , effigy censers at some sites , and parallels between architectural decoration at mayapan and some east coast sites sites in guatemala traded back cacao el chayal in guatemala was the only source of the obsidian found at mayapan this area may have mediated trade between mayapan and the rest of central mexico sculptures and murals at mayapan suggest that there was contact between mayapan and the rising aztec empire some mayapan figures showed details of aztec dress , and what appears to be an aztec deity is carved on an altar in mayapan pestilence may have been involved in the subsequent abandonment of the site by the remaining xiu inhabitants '' postclassic maya society regenerated at mayapán '' , in after collapse : the regeneration of complex societies , edited by glenn m restall , matthew 2001 the people of the patio : ethnohistoric evidence of yucatec maya royal courts en royal courts of the maya , volume two : data and case studies , edited by takeshi inomata and stephen d ( 2008 ) postclassic maya settlement on the rural urban fringe of mayapán , yucatán , mexico , ph.d

mayapan is 4.2 square kilometers ( about 1.6 square miles ) and has over 4000 structures , most of them residences , packed into this compound within the city walls built-up areas extend a half kilometer beyond the city walls in all directions the wall is 9.1 & nbsp ; km ( about 5.65 miles ) long and is roughly ovate with a pointed northeast corner the ceremonial center of the site is located in square q of the city 's grid in the center of the wider western half of the walled enclosure smith , an archeologist with the carnegie institute , estimated 10–12,000 people lived within the walled city gregory simons survey outside the city walls , there were numerous additional dwellings and he revised the total population estimate to between 15,000–17,000 people people living outside of the city wall engaged in agriculture , animal-raising , and specialized activities such as lime production russell also found a colonnaded hall outside the city wall , revealing much is still to be discovered regarding the complexity of this urban landscape the temple of kukulcan , a large pyramid also known as the castillo , is the main temple in mayapan in form , the temple of kukulcan ( structure q-162 on the site map ) is a radial four-staircase temple with nine terraces ; it is generally similar to the temple of kukulcan at the earlier site of chichen itza however , the mayapan temple appears to be an inferior imitation of the one at chichen itza , and the city 's buildings in general are not constructed as well as those in other mayan cities for example , most or all of the vaulted roofs in mayapan have collapsed , while many of the better-built buildings at chichen itza remain intact unlike chichen itza , mayapan has no ballcourts the extensive residential zones of the site are composed of dwellings and ancillary domestic structures , with those around the ceremonial district larger and of higher quality and those toward the fringes being generally poorer he convened the lords of the region , who agreed to found a new capital at mayapan for example , some sources say that the maya revolted in 1221 against the maya-toltec lords of chichen itza they decided to build a new capital city near the town of telchaquillo , hometown of hunac ceel , the general who defeated the rulers of chichen itza the new city was built within a defensive wall and named mayapan , meaning '' standard of the maya people '' another family , the xiu , may have been living in the mayapan area prior to the arrival of the cocom ; the xiu claim to be a part of the lineage from uxmal this arrangement lasted for over 200 years ) mayapan became the primary city in a group of allies that included much of the northern yucatán , and trade partners that extended directly to honduras , belize , and the caribbean island of cozumel , and indirectly to mexico though mayapan was ruled by a council , the jalach winik and the aj k ’ in ( the highest ruler , and the high priest ) dominated the political sphere the range of classes went from the nobility , down to slaves , with intermediary classes in between archaeological evidence indicates that at least the ceremonial center was burned at the end of the occupation stephens was the first to document parts of the mayapan site with two important illustrations their work was published in a mimeographed series of current reports the final report was published by the carnegie institution as mayapan , yucatan , mexico , by h from 2001 to 2009 , further investigations were begun at the site by a team under the direction of dr marilyn masson from the state university new york at albany , carlos peraza lope of inah , and timothy s great variation is now recognized in the types of work performed by commoners of different households and their degrees of affluence researchers think that this sample represented old charcoal that predated the context in which it was found : a burial found on bedrock in the houselot soils of a post-classical solare dated between a.d the burial appeared to be a secondary interment , and could not be completely excavated because it intruded into a wall : charcoal was found on the upper floor of one of the temples that was dated to a.d the construction fill as well as the upper floors were of post-classical age one was burned copal found in an unknown structure ( apparently the label had eroded off of the structure ) ; the researchers inferred that it was q-95 the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history carbon dating of the pits below what was assumed to be q-97 ( again the label had eroded ) dated from a.d charcoal found in the early construction phase of the site 's main pyramid was dated a.d diego de landa calderon , yucatán before and after the conquest , 1937 ( reprinted in 2008 ) see : abridged history of yucatan , pp 8 kukulcan 's realm : urban life at ancient mayapán , marilyn masson & carlos peraza lope , university press of colorado 2014 , chapter 8 : militarism , misery and collapse researchers have suggested that mayapan was an import/export center , and that they often traded luxury goods , such as cotton , salt , and honey , for products of obsidian and metal , which they would have forged the largest samples of recognized remains within the monumental center were from : white-tailed deer ( 23 % ) , dog ( 4.4 % ) , turkey ( 12.9 % ) , and iguana ( 10.2 % ) primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize a wide variety of goods were traded , including maize , honey , salt , fish , game , cloth , and birds zacpeten on lake salpeten & nbsp ; – incense burners found at this site are nearly identical to those found at mayapan the temple assemblages at zacpeten are very similar to those at mayapan also , tiny “ dwarf ” shrines found at this site were very similar to shrines found at mayapan the two sites appear to have been abandoned around the same time ; which may suggest a connection between their governments architectural and artifact connections are seen between mayapan and the utatlan in highland guatemala sculptures and murals at mayapan suggest that there was contact between mayapan and the rising aztec empire some mayapan figures showed details of aztec dress , and what appears to be an aztec deity is carved on an altar in mayapan this evidence suggests a : “ circum-yucatecan trade route that linked mayapan to peten , northern belize , and east-coast sites in the late postclassic period : representations of quetzalcoatl : murals in structure q.80 show reptile iconography which has been interpreted as participation in mixteca-puebla traditions , carlos peraza lope , miguel delgado kú this has led many sources to believe that the itza and the xiw may have been associated with east and west the integration of classes extends to the outer edges of the residential areas probably due to the convenience of being close to the agricultural fields however , written records state that the site was abandoned in a.d very little evidence has been found to support later usage of mayapan in the carnegie maya ii : carnegie institution of washington current reports , 1952–1957 , edited by john weeks , pp “ mayapan ” in international dictionary of historic places , volume i : americas ( 2008 ) postclassic maya settlement on the rural urban fringe of mayapán , yucatán , mexico , ph.d

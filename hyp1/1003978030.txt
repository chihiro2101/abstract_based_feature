midden samples in this area suggest occupation prior to the construction of the post-classical houselots the early date would suggest that this temple was built and in use in mayapan 's early history mayapan 's settlement pattern radiated outwards to its fringes over time ; many of the later dates are from materials outside of the main group of ruins cenotes and underground limestone canals serve as the only source of freshwater in this area , making them essential to support agriculture researchers have suggested that mayapan was an import/export center , and that they often traded luxury goods , such as cotton , salt , and honey , for products of obsidian and metal , which they would have forged faunal remains indicate that the local population used varying methods of animal acquisition peraza lope in 2008 looked at faunal remains from two different middens , one located in the monumental center by some houses , and the other is located in the domestic area outside the monumental compound these percentages as well as the ones that will follow for the settlement zone are based on recognized remains primary animals may have made up larger portions of the diet but their remains are too difficult to recognize both turtle and rabbit remains were found in both sites , but they were consumed in small amounts ( less than 1.5 % ) while excavating , the researchers noted many fish skeletons , but few fish heads they concluded that the fish were being traded into mayapan , and not collected near the site if the fish had been prepared at the site , the heads would have been common refuse the east coast sites exported products such as cotton , salt , and honey from the yucatán the presence of matillas fine orange ceramics in mayapan suggests trade with tabasco the symbolism present in mayapan is particularly significant , partially because the center of the site is mainly used for ritual purposes there are similar representations found at coba and on some pottery in cholula dated to circa 1350–1550 ad 2010 ) serpent iconography is very common at mayapan , serpent balustrade carvings are common throughout the ritual center in the complexes that are associated with the cocom lineage like the castillo ( milbrath , susan the east was associated with : life , males , and heat ; whereas the west was associated with : death , females , and cold many of these tandem structures include multiple residential buildings ; the size of these residential buildings , relative to each other , suggests that some of them were for slaves this is shown in relation to the analysis of household oratarios and those oriented around the ceremonial center of mayapan the strongest evidence for inequality in mayapan is found in the presence of deep shafts full of sacrificial victims , this suggests that the noble class had enough power to condemn some people to death the site of mayapan was abandoned sometime in the 15th century and carlos peraza lope 2007 kukulkan/quetzalcoat , death god , and creation mythology of burial shaft temples at mayapan '' literary sources for the history of mayapan '' , in mayapan , yucatán , mexico

al ( oh ) 3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers all forms of al ( oh ) 3 crystals are hexagonal : gibbsite is also known as γ-al ( oh ) 3 or α-al ( oh ) 3 bayerite is also known as α-al ( oh ) 3 or β-alumina trihydrate citation needed nordstrandite is also known as al ( oh ) 3 doyleite hydrargillite , once thought to be aluminium hydroxide , is an aluminium phosphate nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe it neutralizes the acid , yielding a salt : : 3 hcl + al ( oh ) 3 → alcl 3 + 3 h 2 o in bases , it acts as a lewis acid by binding hydroxide ions : : al ( oh ) 3 + oh − → al ( oh ) 4 − virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate since then , multiple epidemiology studies have found no connection between exposure to environmental or swallowed aluminium and neurological disorders , though injected aluminium was not looked at in these studies

al ( oh ) 3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination aluminium hydroxide also finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications in addition to behaving as a fire retardant , it is very effective as a smoke suppressant in a wide range of polymers , most especially in polyesters , acrylics , ethylene vinyl acetate , epoxies , pvc and rubber aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate under the generic name '' algeldrate '' , aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid in humans and animals ( mainly cats and dogs )

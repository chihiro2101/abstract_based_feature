al ( oh ) 3 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination the residue or bauxite tailings , which is mostly iron oxide , is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide it was historically stored in lagoons ; this led to the ajka alumina plant accident in 2010 in hungary , where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels , which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification since then , multiple epidemiology studies have found no connection between exposure to environmental or swallowed aluminium and neurological disorders , though injected aluminium was not looked at in these studies

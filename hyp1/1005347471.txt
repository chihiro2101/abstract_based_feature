all feature layers of octahedron aluminium hydroxide units , with hydrogen bonds between the layers nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric in acid , it acts as a brønsted–lowry base virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination the residue or bauxite tailings , which is mostly iron oxide , is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide the aluminium salt , when ingested , binds to phosphate in the intestines and reduce the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed precipitated aluminium hydroxide is included as an adjuvant in some vaccines ( e.g vaccine formulations containing aluminium hydroxide stimulate the immune system by inducing the release of uric acid , an immunological danger signal

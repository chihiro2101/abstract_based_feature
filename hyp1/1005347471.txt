nonetheless , both gibbsite and hydrargillite refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide , with gibbsite used most commonly in the united states and hydrargillite used more often in europe aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric it neutralizes the acid , yielding a salt : : 3 hcl + al ( oh ) 3 → alcl 3 + 3 h 2 o in bases , it acts as a lewis acid by binding hydroxide ions : : al ( oh ) 3 + oh − → al ( oh ) 4 − virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to the waste solid , bauxite tailings , is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate this aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination it was historically stored in lagoons ; this led to the ajka alumina plant accident in 2010 in hungary , where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds : speciality calcined aluminas , aluminium sulfate , polyaluminium chloride , aluminium chloride , zeolites , sodium aluminate , activated alumina , and aluminium nitrate under the generic name '' algeldrate '' , aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid in humans and animals ( mainly cats and dogs ) aluminium hydroxide is sometimes called '' alum '' , a term generally reserved for one of several sulfates

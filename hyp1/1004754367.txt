members of parliament ( mps ) wishing to give up their seats before the next general election are appointed to an office which causes the mp to be disqualified from membership historically , all '' offices of profit under the crown '' could be used for this purpose however , only two are still in use : crown steward and bailiff of the three chiltern hundreds of stoke , desborough and burnham crown steward and bailiff of the manor of northstead the stewardships are unpaid positions that provide no benefits and carry no responsibilities the chiltern hundreds last required an actual steward in the 16th century the stewardships have been maintained as nominal offices of profit solely as a legal fiction to meet the requirements of the house of commons disqualification act 1975 the offices are used alternately , making it possible for two members to resign at the same time resignation from the house of commons has never been allowed in theory , although five mps were allowed to resign in the early 17th century on grounds of ill health an mp could not effectively tend to personal business at home while he was away at parliament , yet mps were unpaid originally , the disqualification of office holders from parliament came about as part of the long struggle to ensure that parliament would remain free from undue influence on the part of the monarch since anyone receiving a salary from the crown could not be truly independent , the house of commons passed a resolution on 30 december 1680 stating that an mp who '' shall accept any office , or place of profit , from the crown , without the leave of this house however , mps were able to hold crown stewardships until 1740 , when sir watkin williams-wynn became steward of the lordship and manor of bromfield and yale and was deemed to have vacated his commons seat after the precedent set in 1740 , it became possible for mps to step down by being appointed to a crown stewardship moreover , it quickly became apparent that if ministers of the crown were to be meaningfully responsible to parliament , they needed to be able to sit in the house of commons for this reason , someone appointed to an office of profit was only disqualified from continuing to sit in the house of commons ; it was possible for someone already in office to be ( re- ) elected to parliament without relinquishing the office on 17 january 1751 , pitt was appointed to the office of steward of the chiltern hundreds , and was then elected unopposed for dorchester the law relating to resignation is now codified and consolidated in section 4 of the house of commons disqualification act 1975 : schedule 1 lists actual offices that are disqualifying for membership in the house of commons when an mp is appointed to the post , the treasury releases a public notice : '' the chancellor of the exchequer has this day appointed named individual to be steward and bailiff of the three hundreds of chiltern the escheatorship of munster was first used for parliamentary purposes in the irish parliament from 1793 to 1800 , and in the united parliament ( 24 times for irish seats and once for a scottish seat ) from 1801 to 1820

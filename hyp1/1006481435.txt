data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the chief founders were edson de castro , henry burkhardt iii , and richard sogge of digital equipment ( dec ) , and herbert richman of fairchild semiconductor edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market de castro was watching developments in manufacturing , especially more complex printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) and wave soldering that suggested that the pdp-8 could be greatly cost-reduced it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash the original nova was soon followed by the faster supernova , which replaced the nova 's 4-bit arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast during this period the nova generated 20 % annual growth rates for the company , becoming a star in the business community and generating us 100 million in sales in 1975 based on many of the same concepts as the nova , it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) this would allow the isa to be tailored to the programs being run , for instance , one might upload an isa tuned for cobol if the company 's workload included significant numbers of cobol programs by late 1979 , it became clear that eagle would deliver before fountainhead , igniting an intense turf war within the company for constantly shrinking project funds ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation dg technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the dg factory in mexico where they were made and refurbished while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation data general developed operating systems for its hardware : dos and rdos for the nova , rdos and aos for the 16-bit eclipse c , m , and s lines , aos/vs and aos/vs ii for the eclipse mv line , and a modified version of unix system v called dg/ux for the eclipse mv and aviion machines the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components data general also offered an office automation suite named ceo ( data general ) ( ceo ) , which included a mail system , a calendar , a folder-based document store , a word processor ( ceowrite ) , a spreadsheet processor , and other assorted tools ceowrite was also offered on the dg one portable pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents these products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features the second was the cs40 line of products , which used cobol and their own isam data manager both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from cobol to handle the screen the cs40 ( the first of this line ) was a package system which supported four terminal users , each running a different cobol program tpms used defined subroutine calls for screen functions from cobol or pl/i , which in some users ' eyes made it more difficult to use because it was based on x.25 , remote sites could be linked together over commercial x.25 services like telenet in the us or datapac in canada data general software packages supporting xodiac included comprehensive electronic office ( ceo ) '' specifically '' , the report stated , '' dg should examine the unix market , where all of the needed software already exists , and see if dg can provide compelling unix solutions dg attacked this problem in the same fashion as the processor issue , by running a large number of drives in parallel the clariion line was marketed not only to aviion and data general mv series customers , but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as sun microsystems , hewlett packard and silicon graphics after leaving dg he co-founded alliant computer systems along with former dg colleague craig mundie microsoft presspass - microsoft executives and images ray ozzie was a software developer at data general edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola as ceo

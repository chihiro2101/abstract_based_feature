origin , founding and early years : nova and supernova data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market it was designed specifically to be used in laboratory equipment settings ; as the technology improved , it was reduced in size to fit into a 19-inch rack the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash dec sued for misappropriation of its trade secrets , data general corp with the initial success of the nova , data general went public in the fall of 1969 the original nova was soon followed by the faster supernova , which replaced the nova 's 4-bit arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast the last major version , the nova 4 , was released in 1978 during this period the nova generated 20 % annual growth rates for the company , becoming a star in the business community and generating us 100 million in sales in 1975 the nova series played a very important role as instruction-set inspiration to charles p thumb in 1974 , the nova was supplanted by their upscale 16-bit machine , the eclipse newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' this coincided with the ageing 16-bit products , notably the pdp-11 , which were coming due for replacement data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it the developers were given free rein over the design and selected a system that used a writable instruction set the idea was that the instruction set architecture ( isa ) was not fixed , programs could write their own isa and upload it as microcode to the processor 's control store dg 's customers left quickly for the vax world it was backwards-compatible with 16-bit eclipse applications , used the same command-line interpreter , but offered improved 32-bit performance over the vax 11/780 while using fewer components ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the mv systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for data general through the early 1980s sales picked up , and by 1984 the company had over a billion dollars in annual sales despite some tensions , the implementation was effective and the overall effects on the agency notably positive the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation the mv/60000ha was intended to be a high availability system , with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure in retrospect , the nicely performing mv series was too little , too late while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation the rpg product ( shipped in 1976 ) incorporated a language runtime system implemented as a virtual machine which executed pre-compiled code as sequences of pln statements and eclipse commercial instruction routines both of these products were a major departure from the transaction monitors of the day which did not have a screen design tool and used subroutine calls from cobol to handle the screen eventually , idea ran on every commercial hardware product from the micronova ( 4 users ) to the mv series under aos/vs , the same idea program running all those systems data general 's introduction of the data general-one ( dg-1 ) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough pc product dg quickly responded by introduced new models of the aviion series based on a true commodity processor , the intel x86 series the clariion and celerra storage products evolved into emc 's unified storage platform , the vnx platform craig mundie was a software developer at data general and later became chief technologist at microsoft edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola as ceo

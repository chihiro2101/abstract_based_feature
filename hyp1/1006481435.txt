origin , founding and early years : nova and supernova the chief founders were edson de castro , henry burkhardt iii , and richard sogge of digital equipment ( dec ) , and herbert richman of fairchild semiconductor edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer dec sued for misappropriation of its trade secrets , data general corp with the initial success of the nova , data general went public in the fall of 1969 the last major version , the nova 4 , was released in 1978 during this period the nova generated 20 % annual growth rates for the company , becoming a star in the business community and generating us 100 million in sales in 1975 thacker and others at xerox parc during their construction of the xerox alto production problems with the eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s many customers sued data general after more than a year of waiting , charging the company with breach of contract , while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) this would allow the isa to be tailored to the programs being run , for instance , one might upload an isa tuned for cobol if the company 's workload included significant numbers of cobol programs when digital 's vax-11/780 was shipped in february 1978 , however , fountainhead was not yet ready to deliver a machine , due mainly to problems in project management in the spring of 1978 , with fountainhead apparently in development hell , a secret skunkworks project was started to develop an alternative 32-bit system known as '' eagle '' by a team led by tom west eagle was a straightforward , 32-bit extension of the nova-based eclipse in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history the mv systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for data general one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation dg technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the dg factory in mexico where they were made and refurbished while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation dg had also changed their marketing to focus on direct sales to fortune 100 companies and thus alienated many resellers data general developed operating systems for its hardware : dos and rdos for the nova , rdos and aos for the 16-bit eclipse c , m , and s lines , aos/vs and aos/vs ii for the eclipse mv line , and a modified version of unix system v called dg/ux for the eclipse mv and aviion machines the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components related system software also in common use at the time included such packages as x.25 , xodiac , and tcp/ip for networking , fortran , cobol , rpg , pl/i , c and data general business basic for programming , infos ii and dg/dbms for databases , and the nascent relational database software dg/sql data general also offered an office automation suite named ceo ( data general ) ( ceo ) , which included a mail system , a calendar , a folder-based document store , a word processor ( ceowrite ) , a spreadsheet processor , and other assorted tools pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer these products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features the clariion line was marketed not only to aviion and data general mv series customers , but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as sun microsystems , hewlett packard and silicon graphics clariion was the only product line that saw continued success through the later 1990s after finding a large niche for unix storage systems , and its sales were still strong enough to make dg a takeover target although details of the acquisition specified that emc had to take the entire company , and not just the storage line , emc quickly ended all development and production of dg computer hardware and parts , effectively ending data general 's presence in the segment edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions at apollo computer , sun microsystems and motorola

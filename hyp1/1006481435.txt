origin , founding and early years : nova and supernova data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the chief founders were edson de castro , henry burkhardt iii , and richard sogge of digital equipment ( dec ) , and herbert richman of fairchild semiconductor edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture it lacked general registers and the stack-pointer functionality of the more advanced pdp-11 , as did competing products , such as the hp 2100 ; compilers used hardware-based memory locations in lieu of a stack pointer designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster dec sued for misappropriation of its trade secrets , data general corp with the initial success of the nova , data general went public in the fall of 1969 during this period the nova generated 20 % annual growth rates for the company , becoming a star in the business community and generating us 100 million in sales in 1975 in 1977 , dg launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the micronova to poor commercial success newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered many customers sued data general after more than a year of waiting , charging the company with breach of contract , while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it the developers were given free rein over the design and selected a system that used a writable instruction set when digital 's vax-11/780 was shipped in february 1978 , however , fountainhead was not yet ready to deliver a machine , due mainly to problems in project management in the spring of 1978 , with fountainhead apparently in development hell , a secret skunkworks project was started to develop an alternative 32-bit system known as '' eagle '' by a team led by tom west it was backwards-compatible with 16-bit eclipse applications , used the same command-line interpreter , but offered improved 32-bit performance over the vax 11/780 while using fewer components ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all the introduction , implementation , and effects of the dg systems in usfs were documented in a series of evaluative reports prepared in the late 1980s by the rand corporation the mv/60000ha was intended to be a high availability system , with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure at a time when dg invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment , the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment , and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines , once dg 's best customer segment while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components data general also offered an office automation suite named ceo ( data general ) ( ceo ) , which included a mail system , a calendar , a folder-based document store , a word processor ( ceowrite ) , a spreadsheet processor , and other assorted tools ceowrite was also offered on the dg one portable pln ( created by robert nichols ) was the host language for a number of dg products , making them easier to develop , enhance , and maintain than macro assembler equivalents the rpg product ( shipped in 1976 ) incorporated a language runtime system implemented as a virtual machine which executed pre-compiled code as sequences of pln statements and eclipse commercial instruction routines the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers these products were popular with business customers because of their screen design feature and other ease-of-use features data general 's introduction of the data general-one ( dg-1 ) in 1984 is one of the few cases of a minicomputer company introducing a truly breakthrough pc product '' specifically '' , the report stated , '' dg should examine the unix market , where all of the needed software already exists , and see if dg can provide compelling unix solutions the clariion line was marketed not only to aviion and data general mv series customers , but also to customers running servers from other vendors such as sun microsystems , hewlett packard and silicon graphics official website , circa 1996 simulogics ( '' dedicated to preserving the history and legacy of the

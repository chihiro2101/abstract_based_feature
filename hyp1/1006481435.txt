data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market it was designed specifically to be used in laboratory equipment settings ; as the technology improved , it was reduced in size to fit into a 19-inch rack de castro was watching developments in manufacturing , especially more complex printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) and wave soldering that suggested that the pdp-8 could be greatly cost-reduced the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash dec sued for misappropriation of its trade secrets , data general corp with the initial success of the nova , data general went public in the fall of 1969 in 1977 , dg launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the micronova to poor commercial success newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of dg 's customers , which were never delivered the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year strong demand continued for the nova series , resulting in the nova 4 , perhaps as a result of the continuing problems with the eclipse while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it the developers were given free rein over the design and selected a system that used a writable instruction set it was backwards-compatible with 16-bit eclipse applications , used the same command-line interpreter , but offered improved 32-bit performance over the vax 11/780 while using fewer components ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history the mv systems generated an almost miraculous turnaround for data general one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c this required equipment of high reliability and generally rugged construction that could be deployed in a wide range of places , often to be maintained and used by people with no computer background at all despite some tensions , the implementation was effective and the overall effects on the agency notably positive the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer the mv/60000ha was intended to be a high availability system , with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure at a time when dg invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment , the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment , and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines , once dg 's best customer segment while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation data general developed operating systems for its hardware : dos and rdos for the nova , rdos and aos for the 16-bit eclipse c , m , and s lines , aos/vs and aos/vs ii for the eclipse mv line , and a modified version of unix system v called dg/ux for the eclipse mv and aviion machines the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components the latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters the dg easy product , a portable application platform developed by nichols and others from 1975 to 1979 but never marketed , had roots easily traceable back to the rpg vm created by stephen schleimer also notable were several commercial software products developed in the mid to late 1970s in conjunction with the commercial computers the first product was idea ( interactive data entry/access ) , which consisted of a screen design tool ( ifmt ) , tp controller ( imon ) , and a program development language ( ifpl ) because it was based on x.25 , remote sites could be linked together over commercial x.25 services like telenet in the us or datapac in canada '' now the customer could run any software they wished as long as it ran on unix , and by the early 1990s , everything did clariion was the only product line that saw continued success through the later 1990s after finding a large niche for unix storage systems , and its sales were still strong enough to make dg a takeover target craig mundie was a software developer at data general and later became chief technologist at microsoft asher waldfogel was a software engineer in special systems ( software ) who later went on to found redback networks , tollbridge technologies and peakstream

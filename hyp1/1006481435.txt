data general ( dg ) was founded by several engineers from digital equipment corporation who were frustrated with dec 's management and left to form their own company the chief founders were edson de castro , henry burkhardt iii , and richard sogge of digital equipment ( dec ) , and herbert richman of fairchild semiconductor edson de castro was the chief engineer in charge of the pdp-8 , dec 's line of inexpensive computers that created the minicomputer market de castro was watching developments in manufacturing , especially more complex printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) and wave soldering that suggested that the pdp-8 could be greatly cost-reduced convinced he could do one better , de castro began work on his own low-cost 16-bit design the nova , like the pdp-8 , used a simple accumulator-based architecture designed to be rack-mounted similarly to the later pdp-8 machines , it was packaged on four pcb cards and was thus smaller in height , while also including a number of features that made it run considerably faster announced as '' the best small computer in the world '' , the nova quickly gained a following , especially in scientific and educational markets , and made the company flush with cash the original nova was soon followed by the faster supernova , which replaced the nova 's 4-bit arithmetic logic unit ( alu ) with a 16-bit version that made the machine roughly four times as fast the last major version , the nova 4 , was released in 1978 in 1977 , dg launched a 16-bit microcomputer called the micronova to poor commercial success based on many of the same concepts as the nova , it included support for virtual memory and multitasking more suitable to the small office environment production problems with the eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s many customers sued data general after more than a year of waiting , charging the company with breach of contract , while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere the eclipse was originally intended to replace the nova outright , evidenced by the fact that the nova 3 series , released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the eclipse , was phased out the next year while dg was still struggling with eclipse , in 1977 , digital announced the vax series , their first 32-bit minicomputer line , described as '' super-minis '' it appeared there was an enormous potential market for 32-bit machines , one that dg might be able to '' scoop '' data general immediately launched their own 32-bit effort in 1976 to build what they called the '' world 's best 32-bit machine '' , known internally as the '' fountainhead project '' , or fhp for short ( fountain head project ) development took place off-site so that even dg workers would not know of it the idea was that the instruction set architecture ( isa ) was not fixed , programs could write their own isa and upload it as microcode to the processor 's control store this would allow the isa to be tailored to the programs being run , for instance , one might upload an isa tuned for cobol if the company 's workload included significant numbers of cobol programs it was backwards-compatible with 16-bit eclipse applications , used the same command-line interpreter , but offered improved 32-bit performance over the vax 11/780 while using fewer components in the meantime , customers were abandoning data general in droves , driven not only by the delivery problems with the original eclipse , including very serious quality control and customer service problems , but also the power and versatility of digital 's new vax line ultimately , fountainhead was cancelled and eagle became the new mv series , with the first model , the data general eclipse mv/8000 , announced in april 1980 the eagle project was the subject of tracy kidder 's pulitzer prize-winning book , the soul of a new machine , making the mv line the best-documented computer project in recent history one of data general 's significant customers at this time was the united states forest service , which starting in the mid-1980s used dg systems installed at all levels from headquarters in washington , d.c down to individual ranger stations and fire command posts the mv series came in various iterations , from the mv/2000 ( later mv/2500 ) , mv/4000 , mv/10000 , mv/15000 , mv/20000 , mv/30000 , mv/40000 and ultimately concluded with the mv/60000ha minicomputer the mv/60000ha was intended to be a high availability system , with many components duplicated to eliminate the single point of failure dg technicians were kept quite busy replacing boards and many blamed poor quality control at the dg factory in mexico where they were made and refurbished at a time when dg invested its last dollar into the dying minicomputer segment , the microcomputer was rapidly making inroads to the lower-end market segment , and the introduction of the first workstations wiped out all 16-bit machines , once dg 's best customer segment while the mv series did stop the erosion of dg 's customer base , this now smaller base was no longer large enough to allow dg to develop their next generation data general developed operating systems for its hardware : dos and rdos for the nova , rdos and aos for the 16-bit eclipse c , m , and s lines , aos/vs and aos/vs ii for the eclipse mv line , and a modified version of unix system v called dg/ux for the eclipse mv and aviion machines the aos/vs software was the most commonly used dg software product and included cli ( command line interpreter ) allowing for complex scripting , dump/load , and other custom components the latter provided microcode acceleration of arithmetic and conversion operations for a wide range of now-arcane data types such as overpunch characters in june 1987 , data general announced its intention to replace xodiac with the osi protocols '' specifically '' , the report stated , '' dg should examine the unix market , where all of the needed software already exists , and see if dg can provide compelling unix solutions data general would be only one of many new england based computer companies , including the original digital equipment corporation , that collapsed or were sold to larger companies after the 1980s edward zander was product marketing manager at data general before his positions

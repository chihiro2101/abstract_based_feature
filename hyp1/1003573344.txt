a symbolic link contains a text string that is automatically interpreted and followed by the operating system as a path to another file or directory the symbolic link is a second file that exists independently of its target if a symbolic link points to a target , and sometime later that target is moved , renamed or deleted , the symbolic link is not automatically updated or deleted , but continues to exist and still points to the old target , now a non-existing location or file symbolic links are different from hard links hard links do not link paths on different volumes or file system , whereas symbolic links may point to any file or directory irrespective of the volumes on which the link and target reside hard links always refer to an existing file , whereas symbolic links may contain an arbitrary path that does not point to anything symbolic links operate transparently for many operations : programs that read or write to files named by a symbolic link will behave as if operating directly on the target file some unix as well as linux distributions use symbolic links extensively in an effort to reorder the file system hierarchy posix and unix-like operating systems in posix-compliant operating systems , symbolic links are created with the symlink symlink , symlinkat the following command creates a symbolic link at the command-line interface ( shell ) : ln -s target_path link_path target_path is the relative or absolute path to which the symbolic link should point usually the target will exist , although symbolic links may be created to non-existent targets when a directory listing of a symbolic link that points to a directory is requested , only the link itself will be displayed early implementations of symbolic links stored the symbolic link information as data in regular files the file contained the textual reference to the link 's target , and the file mode bits indicated that the type of the file is a symbolic link it is also used for disk compatibility with other or older versions of operating systems the file system permissions of a symbolic link are not used ; the access modes of the target file are controlled by the target file 's own permissions ntfs 3.1 introduced support for symbolic links for any type of file additionally , the ntfs symbolic link implementation provides full support for cross-filesystem links symbolic link programming considerations , msdn only users with the new create symbolic link privilege , which only administrators have by default , can create symbolic links in windows vista and later , when the working directory path ends with a symbolic link , the current parent path reference , , will refer to the parent directory of the symbolic link rather than that of its target a variable or variant symbolic link is a symbolic link that has a variable name embedded in it operating systems that make use of variant symbolic links include netbsd , dragonfly bsd , domain/os symbolic drivers for windows xp : file system drivers to enables symbolic links for windows xp ( also mirrored on link shell extension site )

joseph ber soloveitchik was born on february 27 , 1903 , in pruzhany , then russia ( next poland , now belarus ) he came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years : his paternal grandfather was chaim soloveitchik , and his great-grandfather and namesake was yosef dov soloveitchik , the beis halevi his great-great-grandfather was naftali zvi yehuda berlin ( the netziv ) , and his great-great-great-great grandfather was chaim volozhin his father , moshe soloveichik ( note different spelling of last name ) , preceded him as head of the riets rabbinical school at yeshiva university on his maternal line , soloveitchik was a grandson of eliyahu feinstein and his wife guta feinstein , née davidovitch , who , in turn , was a descendant of a long line of kapulyan rabbis , and of the tosafot yom tov , the shelah , the maharshal , and rashi soloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a talmud torah , an elementary yeshiva , and by private tutors , as his parents realized his great mental prowess in 1924 , he entered the free polish university in warsaw , where he spent three terms , studying political science he passed the examination for supplementary subjects at the german institute for studies by foreigners , and was then given full matriculation at the university during his years in berlin , soloveitchik became a close disciple of hayyim heller , who had established an institute for advanced jewish studies from an orthodox perspective in the city both of them developed a system of thought that bridged the eastern european way of traditional scholarship with the new forces of modernity in the western world among the other personalities with whom he came into contact were the lubavitcher rebbe , professor alexander altmann , yehiel yaakov weinberg , rector of the hildesheimer rabbinical seminary , and professor yeshayahu leibowitz an american orthodox dreamer : rabbi joseph b soloveitchik and boston 's maimonides school , by seth farber , university press of new england , 2003 when the school 's high school was founded in the late 1940s , he instituted a number of innovations in the curriculum , including teaching talmud to boys and girls studying in classes together he was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of kosher slaughtering - shechita - and an educator , gladly accepting invitations to lecture in jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious new england colleges and universities rabbi soloveitchik was also the head of boston 's council of orthodox synagogues ( also called the vaad ha'ir ) he was the first occupant of the leib merkin distinguished professorial chair in talmud and jewish philosophy at riets he ordained over 2,000 rabbis , many of whom are among the leaders of orthodox judaism and the jewish people today in addition , he gave public lectures that were attended by thousands from throughout the greater jewish community , as well as regular classes at other new york institutions with his enlightened outlook , he attracted and inspired many young men and women to become spiritual leaders and educators in jewish communities worldwide they , in turn , went out with the education of yeshiva university to head synagogues , schools , and communities , where they continue to influence many jews to remain - or become - committed to orthodoxy and observance through public lectures , writings , and his policy decisions for the modern orthodox world , he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of modern orthodoxy soloveitchik describes how the man of faith integrates both of these aspects in the first chapter , adam i is created together with eve , and they are given the mandate to subdue nature , master the cosmos , and transform the world '' into a domain for their power and sovereignty '' adam i is majestic man who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional , pragmatic terms adam i , created in the image of god , fulfills this apparently '' secular '' mandate by conquering the universe , imposing his knowledge , technology , and cultural institutions upon the world the human community depicted in genesis 1 is a utilitarian one , where man and woman join together , like the male and female of other animals , to further the ends of their species in chapter two of genesis , adam ii , on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith - bringing a '' redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence '' in halakhic man , soloveitchik propounds the centrality of halakha in jewish thought soloveitchik emphasizes halakha 's '' this-worldly , here-and-now grounding '' , as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm after all , the torah does say 'love the lord thy god with all thy heart and soul and might ' there was - and is - an ish torah torah man who combines halakhah and aggadah , but that is another matter altogether when i came to berlin i was shocked to hear my fellow students talking about the problem of halakha as a central issue soloveitchik became a '' lightning rod '' of criticism from two directions departure from the traditional brisker view of zionism despite their religious disagreements , soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty , speaking fondly of his '' uncle '' yitzchak zev soloveitchik ( the '' brisker rov '' ) to his relatives and namesakes who now lived in jerusalem , where they had established their own branch of the brisk yeshiva , he was respected for his genius in talmudic scholarship which few could challenge or disparage , despite their very differing views on zionism ( the '' briskers '' in jerusalem being staunch anti-zionists ) in any case , most modern orthodox institutions today , including yeshiva university , have connections to soloveitchik relations with agudath israel after soloveitchik left agudath israel , the organization 's leadership was mostly quiet when it came to public statements involving soloveitchik the article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the jewish observer 's usually comparatively long obituaries , for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents , and portraying soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough '' two letters and a response '' by lawrence kaplan and the novominsker rebbe schoenfeld quoted soloveitchik as having told him that when he was studying at the university of berlin , '' i can testify that schneerson never missed going to the mikva one single day '' in 1964 , soloveitchik paid a lengthy visit while schneerson was mourning the death of his mother their conversation during this visit lasted approximately two hours soloveitchik later visited again following the death of schneerson 's mother-in-law the visit lasted close to two hours after which soloveitchik told schacter his opinion of schneerson : '' he is a gaon ( genius ) , he is a great one , he is a leader of israel many of soloveitchik 's students became leaders in the modern orthodox community these students tend to espouse very distinct world views the institution he founded , the shalom hartman institute , is a home for serious thinkers from orthodoxy , conservative/masorti , reform and even secular scholars , and trains hundreds of jewish community leaders annually rabbis avi weiss and saul berman , who represent liberal modern orthodox institutions such as yeshivat chovevei torah and edah , are somewhat further to the right of irving greenberg , riskin and hartman , but still very liberal in comparison to most orthodox thinkers ( weiss has classified this approach as '' open orthodoxy '' ) many students of soloveitchik represent a centrist approach to modern orthodoxy ( which lamm has coined '' centrist orthodoxy '' ) such as rabbis aharon lichtenstein , benjamin blech , lawrence kaplan , and lamm the torah umadda journal , tradition magazine , the rabbinical council of america , efrat , yeshiva university , bnei akiva , the orthodox union , and various post-high school yeshivot and seminaries in israel ( i.e similarly , some scholars of soloveitchik 's philosophy maintain that an eclectic pragmatic approach was adopted by soloveitchik as well this issue has been discussed in many articles in tradition : a journal of orthodox thought , published by the rabbinical council of america according to this view , soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for jews to learn secular philosophy , music , art , literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this he stated that many of his students '' act like children , and experience religion like children '' ( a reader 's companion to ish ha-halakhah : introductory section , david shatz , yeshiva university , joseph b against any revisionism , any attempts to misinterpret the rav 's work in both worlds the world of torah and the world of madda ( science ) soloveitchik held that non-orthodox jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny , yet they are still bound together with orthodox jews in the covenant of fate per halpern , subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the orthodox , but a letter from eleven rosh yeshivas was circulated declaring that orthodox rabbis were forbidden to cooperate with conservative rabbis ( proceedings of the cjls of the

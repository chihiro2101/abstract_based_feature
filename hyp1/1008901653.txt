, who , in turn , was a descendant of a long line of kapulyan rabbis , and of the tosafot yom tov , the shelah , the maharshal , and rashi soloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a talmud torah , an elementary yeshiva , and by private tutors , as his parents realized his great mental prowess in 1924 , he entered the free polish university in warsaw , where he spent three terms , studying political science he passed the examination for supplementary subjects at the german institute for studies by foreigners , and was then given full matriculation at the university he took up studies in philosophy , economics , and hebrew subjects , simultaneously maintaining a rigorous schedule of intensive talmud study eugen mittwoch and professor dr he studied the work of european philosophers , and was a life-long student of neo-kantian thought contrary to most biographies , which erroneously state that in 1931 , he received his degree , he actually passed his oral doctor 's examination on july 24 , 1930 , but graduated with a doctorate only on december 19 , 1932 , as he had requested an extension to allow him to expand his thesis documents exist to support this assertion , located by marc b during his years in berlin , soloveitchik became a close disciple of hayyim heller , who had established an institute for advanced jewish studies from an orthodox perspective in the city one such figure was yitzchok hutner , who would become the rosh yeshiva of the yeshiva rabbi chaim berlin , also in brooklyn , new york he pioneered the maimonides school , one of the first hebrew day schools in boston in 1937 he was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of kosher slaughtering - shechita - and an educator , gladly accepting invitations to lecture in jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious new england colleges and universities rabbi soloveitchik was also the head of boston 's council of orthodox synagogues ( also called the vaad ha'ir ) joseph soloveitchik succeeded his father , moses ( moshe ) soloveichik , as the head of the riets rabbinical school at yeshiva university in 1941 he taught there until 1986 , when illness kept him from continuing , and was considered the top rosh yeshiva ( never , however , a formally recognized position at yu ) from the time he began teaching there until his death in 1993 soloveitchik advocated more intensive textual torah study for jewish women at the stern college for women , giving the first class in talmud inaugurated at stern college they , in turn , went out with the education of yeshiva university to head synagogues , schools , and communities , where they continue to influence many jews to remain - or become - committed to orthodoxy and observance during his tenure at yeshiva university , in addition to his talmudic lectures , soloveitchik deepened the system of '' synthesis '' whereby the best of religious torah scholarship would be combined with the best secular scholarship in western civilization through public lectures , writings , and his policy decisions for the modern orthodox world , he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of modern orthodoxy in his major non-talmudic publications , which altered the landscape of jewish philosophy and jewish theology , soloveitchik stresses the normative and intellectual centrality of the halakha corpus he authored a number of essays and books offering a unique synthesis of neo-kantian existentialism and jewish thought , the most well-known being the lonely man of faith which deals with issues such as the willingness to stand alone in the face of monumental challenges , and halakhic man findarticles.com a less known essay , though not less important , is '' the halakhic mind - an essay on jewish tradition and modern thought '' , written in 1944 and published only 40 years later , without any change , as the author himself stresses the lonely man of faith in the first chapter , adam i is created together with eve , and they are given the mandate to subdue nature , master the cosmos , and transform the world '' into a domain for their power and sovereignty '' adam i is majestic man who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional , pragmatic terms adam i , created in the image of god , fulfills this apparently '' secular '' mandate by conquering the universe , imposing his knowledge , technology , and cultural institutions upon the world in chapter two of genesis , adam ii , on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith - bringing a '' redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence '' adam ii does not subdue the garden , but rather tills it and preserves it soloveitchik emphasizes halakha 's '' this-worldly , here-and-now grounding '' , as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm 'torah ' is the more comprehensive word soloveitchik became a '' lightning rod '' of criticism from two directions despite this criticism , soloveitchik remained steadfast in his beliefs and positions throughout the years of his leadership despite their religious disagreements , soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty , speaking fondly of his '' uncle '' yitzchak zev soloveitchik ( the '' brisker rov '' ) see the paragraph on '' zionism '' below for a discussion of soloveitchik 's zionist viewpoint modern orthodox jews consider soloveitchik to be the paradigmatic modern orthodox jew , based on soloveitchik 's focus on secular studies and world culture , and his zionism ( see paragraph on soloveitchik 's zionism below ) after soloveitchik left agudath israel , the organization 's leadership was mostly quiet when it came to public statements involving soloveitchik in may 1993 , nisson wolpin penned an obituary for soloveitchik in the jewish observer the article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the jewish observer 's usually comparatively long obituaries , for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents , and portraying soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough moshe david tendler , a son-in-law of moshe feinstein , wrote a scathing attack on wolpin 's piece , which was published both in the community synagogue of monsey 's newsletter and the algemeiner journal he also did not sign the ban by america 's foremost rabbis against participating in the synagogue council of america schoenfeld quoted soloveitchik as having told him that when he was studying at the university of berlin , '' i can testify that schneerson never missed going to the mikva one single day many of soloveitchik 's students became leaders in the modern orthodox community these students tend to espouse very distinct world views one of the most iconoclastic is david hartman of jerusalem , whose support for pluralism has gained him serious backing in non-orthodox streams and who has brought soloveitchik 's thinking to the non-orthodox the institution he founded , the shalom hartman institute , is a home for serious thinkers from orthodoxy , conservative/masorti , reform and even secular scholars , and trains hundreds of jewish community leaders annually many students of soloveitchik represent a centrist approach to modern orthodoxy ( which lamm has coined '' centrist orthodoxy '' ) such as rabbis aharon lichtenstein , benjamin blech , lawrence kaplan , and lamm further to the right in the spectrum of orthodoxy lie rabbis yehuda parnes and abba bronspiegel , both of whom resigned from teaching positions in yeshiva university to join right-wing alternative lander college since his death , interpretations of soloveitchik 's beliefs have become a matter of ongoing debate , somewhat analogous to the long-standing debate about samson raphael hirsch this issue has been discussed in many articles in tradition : a journal of orthodox thought , published by the rabbinical council of america soloveitchik stated that although he felt that he successfully transmitted the facts and laws of judaism to his students , he felt that he failed in transmitting the experience of living an authentic jewish life yet , i have never seen so much naïve and uncritical commitment to people and to ideas as i see in america against any revisionism , any attempts to misinterpret the rav 's work in both worlds the world of torah and the world of madda ( science ) certain burgeoning revisionisms may well attempt to disguise and distort the rav 's uniqueness by trivializing one or the other aspect of his rich personality and work , but they must be confronted at once soloveitchik developed the idea that jews have historically been linked together by two distinct covenants in 1954 soloveitchik issued a responsum on working with non-orthodox jews , orthodox , conservative and reform jews in the united states : second article in a series on responsa of orthodox judaism in the united states the responsum recognized the leadership of non-orthodox jews in jewish communal institutions ( but not their rabbis in the orthodox sense of the term ) , and concluded that participation with non-orthodox jews for political or welfare purposes is not only permissible , but obligatory holzer seforim.com , israel , 2013 the koren mesorat harav kinot , koren publishers jerusalem & the

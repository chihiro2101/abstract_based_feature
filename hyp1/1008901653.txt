joseph ber soloveitchik was born on february 27 , 1903 , in pruzhany , then russia ( next poland , now belarus ) he came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years : his paternal grandfather was chaim soloveitchik , and his great-grandfather and namesake was yosef dov soloveitchik , the beis halevi his great-great-grandfather was naftali zvi yehuda berlin ( the netziv ) , and his great-great-great-great grandfather was chaim volozhin in 1926 , he came to berlin , germany , and entered the friedrich wilhelm university he studied the work of european philosophers , and was a life-long student of neo-kantian thought during his years in berlin , soloveitchik became a close disciple of hayyim heller , who had established an institute for advanced jewish studies from an orthodox perspective in the city he also made the acquaintance of other young scholars pursuing a similar path to his own one such figure was yitzchok hutner , who would become the rosh yeshiva of the yeshiva rabbi chaim berlin , also in brooklyn , new york among the other personalities with whom he came into contact were the lubavitcher rebbe , professor alexander altmann , yehiel yaakov weinberg , rector of the hildesheimer rabbinical seminary , and professor yeshayahu leibowitz in 1932 , soloveitchik emigrated to america and settled in boston , where he referred to himself as '' the soloveitchik of boston '' he pioneered the maimonides school , one of the first hebrew day schools in boston in 1937 he was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of kosher slaughtering - shechita - and an educator , gladly accepting invitations to lecture in jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious new england colleges and universities rabbi soloveitchik was also the head of boston 's council of orthodox synagogues ( also called the vaad ha'ir ) joseph soloveitchik succeeded his father , moses ( moshe ) soloveichik , as the head of the riets rabbinical school at yeshiva university in 1941 he taught there until 1986 , when illness kept him from continuing , and was considered the top rosh yeshiva ( never , however , a formally recognized position at yu ) from the time he began teaching there until his death in 1993 he was the first occupant of the leib merkin distinguished professorial chair in talmud and jewish philosophy at riets he ordained over 2,000 rabbis , many of whom are among the leaders of orthodox judaism and the jewish people today this later became known as the torah umadda - '' torah and secular wisdom '' philosophy- the motto of yeshiva university through public lectures , writings , and his policy decisions for the modern orthodox world , he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of modern orthodoxy in his major non-talmudic publications , which altered the landscape of jewish philosophy and jewish theology , soloveitchik stresses the normative and intellectual centrality of the halakha corpus in the lonely man of faith , soloveitchik reads the first two chapters of genesis as a contrast in the nature of the human being and identifies two human types : adam i , or '' majestic man '' , who employs his creative faculties in order to master his environment ; and adam ii , or '' covenantal man '' , who surrenders himself in submission to his master in the first chapter , adam i is created together with eve , and they are given the mandate to subdue nature , master the cosmos , and transform the world '' into a domain for their power and sovereignty '' adam i is majestic man who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional , pragmatic terms this type of human being is introduced by the words , '' it is not good for man to be alone '' - and through his sacrifice ( of a metaphoric rib ) , he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness - this covenantal community requires the participation of the divine in halakhic man , soloveitchik propounds the centrality of halakha in jewish thought soloveitchik emphasizes halakha 's '' this-worldly , here-and-now grounding '' , as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm this work argues that jewish piety does not , therefore , fit familiar models of western religiosity , and presents a phenomenology of this religious type there was - and is - an ish torah torah man who combines halakhah and aggadah , but that is another matter altogether halakhic mind is a four-part analysis of the historical correlation between science and philosophy despite this criticism , soloveitchik remained steadfast in his beliefs and positions throughout the years of his leadership his highly original use in all of the foregoing works of categories and concepts drawn from existentialism and other schools of secular modern philosophy is analyzed in some depth in the writings of fr departure from the traditional brisker view of zionism despite their religious disagreements , soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty , speaking fondly of his '' uncle '' yitzchak zev soloveitchik ( the '' brisker rov '' ) modern orthodox jews consider soloveitchik to be the paradigmatic modern orthodox jew , based on soloveitchik 's focus on secular studies and world culture , and his zionism ( see paragraph on soloveitchik 's zionism below ) however , some of soloveitchik 's opinions on these issues are vague , and soloveitchik 's students have taken many different stances on these matters in any case , most modern orthodox institutions today , including yeshiva university , have connections to soloveitchik moshe feinstein , who was soloveitchik 's cousin , maintained very warm and profoundly respectful relations with him yitzchok hutner referred to him as a '' gadol '' ( a foremost torah scholar of the time ) the article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the jewish observer 's usually comparatively long obituaries , for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents , and portraying soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough moshe david tendler , a son-in-law of moshe feinstein , wrote a scathing attack on wolpin 's piece , which was published both in the community synagogue of monsey 's newsletter and the algemeiner journal '' two letters and a response '' by lawrence kaplan and the novominsker rebbe herschel schacter , sholem kowalsky , the rebbe and the rav julius berman ; menachem genack , and fabian schoenfeld ( all students of soloveitchik ) have asserted that menachem mendel schneerson and soloveitchik met for the first time while they both studied in berlin '' in 1964 , soloveitchik paid a lengthy visit while schneerson was mourning the death of his mother the visit lasted close to two hours after which soloveitchik told schacter his opinion of schneerson : '' he is a gaon ( genius ) , he is a great one , he is a leader of israel one of the most iconoclastic is david hartman of jerusalem , whose support for pluralism has gained him serious backing in non-orthodox streams and who has brought soloveitchik 's thinking to the non-orthodox many students of soloveitchik represent a centrist approach to modern orthodoxy ( which lamm has coined '' centrist orthodoxy '' ) such as rabbis aharon lichtenstein , benjamin blech , lawrence kaplan , and lamm further to the right in the spectrum of orthodoxy lie rabbis yehuda parnes and abba bronspiegel , both of whom resigned from teaching positions in yeshiva university to join right-wing alternative lander college since his death , interpretations of soloveitchik 's beliefs have become a matter of ongoing debate , somewhat analogous to the long-standing debate about samson raphael hirsch some haredim and some on the right wing of modern orthodoxy believe that hirsch only wanted jews to combine an observant jewish lifestyle with learning the surrounding gentile society 's language , history , and science , so that a religious jew could operate in the surrounding secular society however , this is not a universally held opinion among right-wing orthodox jews ( see , for example , the writings of shimon schwab and the biography of hirsch by eliyahu klugman ) similarly , some scholars of soloveitchik 's philosophy maintain that an eclectic pragmatic approach was adopted by soloveitchik as well according to this view , soloveitchik did not approve of jews learning secular philosophy , music , art , literature or ethics , unless it was for purposes of obtaining a livelihood or outreach according to this view , soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for jews to learn secular philosophy , music , art , literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this consistent with the traditional rabbinic understanding of this issue , soloveitchik ruled that it was forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a separation between the sexes ( mi-d'orayta , a pentateuchal prohibition ) , and without the use of a mechitza , a divider between the men 's and women 's sections ( mi-derabbenan , a rabbinical prohibition ) his responsa on this question was also directed at the small number of orthodox synagogues that were adopting mixed-sex seating soloveitchik believed that reform and conservative rabbis did not have proper training in halakha and jewish theology , and that due to their decisions and actions , they could not be considered rabbis , as orthodox jews traditionally understood the term the second is the brit goral , '' covenant of fate '' , the desire and willingness to be part of a people chosen by god to live a sacred mission in the world , and the fact that all those who live in this covenant share the same fate of persecution and oppression , even if they do not live by halakha soloveitchik held that non-orthodox jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny , yet they are still bound together with orthodox jews in the covenant of fate in 1954 soloveitchik issued a responsum on working with non-orthodox jews , orthodox , conservative and reform jews in the united states : second article in a series on responsa of orthodox judaism in the united states the council of torah sages of agudath yisroel countered with a ruling that such cooperation with non-orthodox jews was equivalent to endorsement of non-orthodox judaism , and thus was forbidden soloveitchik was the pre-eminent leader of politically conscious pro-zionist modern orthodox judaism shiurei harav—a conspectus of the public lectures of rabbi joseph b soloveitchik '' , modern judaism , 32,1 ( 2012 ) , 54–75 soloveitchik his life introduction to the philosophy of soloveitchik the teachings of the rav rav joseph b

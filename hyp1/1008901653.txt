joseph ber soloveitchik was born on february 27 , 1903 , in pruzhany , then russia ( next poland , now belarus ) he came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years : his paternal grandfather was chaim soloveitchik , and his great-grandfather and namesake was yosef dov soloveitchik , the beis halevi his father , moshe soloveichik ( note different spelling of last name ) , preceded him as head of the riets rabbinical school at yeshiva university soloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a talmud torah , an elementary yeshiva , and by private tutors , as his parents realized his great mental prowess according to a curriculum vitae written and signed in his own hand , in 1922 , he graduated from the liberal arts '' gymnasium '' in dubno in 1924 , he entered the free polish university in warsaw , where he spent three terms , studying political science he passed the examination for supplementary subjects at the german institute for studies by foreigners , and was then given full matriculation at the university he took up studies in philosophy , economics , and hebrew subjects , simultaneously maintaining a rigorous schedule of intensive talmud study according to the cv , among his '' highly honored '' teachers in university , bearing the title '' geheimrat '' ( literally : privy council ) , were professor dr shapiro in the university of berlin archives one such figure was yitzchok hutner , who would become the rosh yeshiva of the yeshiva rabbi chaim berlin , also in brooklyn , new york both of them developed a system of thought that bridged the eastern european way of traditional scholarship with the new forces of modernity in the western world in 1932 , soloveitchik emigrated to america and settled in boston , where he referred to himself as '' the soloveitchik of boston '' he pioneered the maimonides school , one of the first hebrew day schools in boston in 1937 rabbi soloveitchik was also the head of boston 's council of orthodox synagogues ( also called the vaad ha'ir ) his son-in-law , isadore twersky , was an internationally renowned expert on the writings of maimonides , and succeeded professor harry austryn wolfson to the nathan littauer chair of jewish history and literature at harvard university joseph soloveitchik succeeded his father , moses ( moshe ) soloveichik , as the head of the riets rabbinical school at yeshiva university in 1941 he was the first occupant of the leib merkin distinguished professorial chair in talmud and jewish philosophy at riets he ordained over 2,000 rabbis , many of whom are among the leaders of orthodox judaism and the jewish people today in addition , he gave public lectures that were attended by thousands from throughout the greater jewish community , as well as regular classes at other new york institutions soloveitchik advocated more intensive textual torah study for jewish women at the stern college for women , giving the first class in talmud inaugurated at stern college with his enlightened outlook , he attracted and inspired many young men and women to become spiritual leaders and educators in jewish communities worldwide . philosophy and major works this later became known as the torah umadda - '' torah and secular wisdom '' philosophy- the motto of yeshiva university through public lectures , writings , and his policy decisions for the modern orthodox world , he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of modern orthodoxy adam i , created in the image of god , fulfills this apparently '' secular '' mandate by conquering the universe , imposing his knowledge , technology , and cultural institutions upon the world in chapter two of genesis , adam ii , on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith - bringing a '' redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence '' soloveitchik emphasizes halakha 's '' this-worldly , here-and-now grounding '' , as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm here , '' halakhic man '' , as a result of his torah study and his observance of the mitzvah , develops a set of coherent attitudes towards intellectual , asceticism , death , esotericism , mysticism , creativity , repentance , and providence he also underscores the necessity for individual self-creation as the divinely assigned task of the human being no , there never was such a typology in judaism as the halakhic man in poland it had been a foreign expression to me only in its fourth and last part does the author introduce the consequences on the halakha of the analysis performed in the previous three parts from the religious left , he was viewed as being too connected to the old world of europe , while for those on the religious right , he was seen as legitimizing those wanting to lower their religious standards in the attempt to modernize and americanize despite this criticism , soloveitchik remained steadfast in his beliefs and positions throughout the years of his leadership despite their religious disagreements , soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty , speaking fondly of his '' uncle '' yitzchak zev soloveitchik ( the '' brisker rov '' ) to his relatives and namesakes who now lived in jerusalem , where they had established their own branch of the brisk yeshiva , he was respected for his genius in talmudic scholarship which few could challenge or disparage , despite their very differing views on zionism ( the '' briskers '' in jerusalem being staunch anti-zionists ) modern orthodox jews consider soloveitchik to be the paradigmatic modern orthodox jew , based on soloveitchik 's focus on secular studies and world culture , and his zionism ( see paragraph on soloveitchik 's zionism below ) however , some of soloveitchik 's opinions on these issues are vague , and soloveitchik 's students have taken many different stances on these matters moshe feinstein , who was soloveitchik 's cousin , maintained very warm and profoundly respectful relations with him they corresponded and spoke ( at least ) on the eve of every jewish holiday yitzchok hutner referred to him as a '' gadol '' ( a foremost torah scholar of the time ) the article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the jewish observer 's usually comparatively long obituaries , for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents , and portraying soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough soloveitchik did not sign feinstein 's proposed ban on interfaith dialogue instead , he published a path-breaking essay expounding his views on the subject , entitled '' confrontation '' it has been debated whether his refusal to sign was because he believed in participating in the sca , or because he was not happy with the way the ban was instituted '' two letters and a response '' by lawrence kaplan and the novominsker rebbe . relations with rabbi menachem mendel schneerson schoenfeld quoted soloveitchik as having told him that when he was studying at the university of berlin , '' i can testify that schneerson never missed going to the mikva one single day their conversation during this visit lasted approximately two hours in 1980 , accompanied by his student herschel schacter , soloveitchik visited schneerson at chabad headquarters in brooklyn on the occasion of a celebration marking the 30th anniversary of his leadership the institution he founded , the shalom hartman institute , is a home for serious thinkers from orthodoxy , conservative/masorti , reform and even secular scholars , and trains hundreds of jewish community leaders annually rabbis avi weiss and saul berman , who represent liberal modern orthodox institutions such as yeshivat chovevei torah and edah , are somewhat further to the right of irving greenberg , riskin and hartman , but still very liberal in comparison to most orthodox thinkers ( weiss has classified this approach as '' open orthodoxy '' ) further to the right in the spectrum of orthodoxy lie rabbis yehuda parnes and abba bronspiegel , both of whom resigned from teaching positions in yeshiva university to join right-wing alternative lander college since his death , interpretations of soloveitchik 's beliefs have become a matter of ongoing debate , somewhat analogous to the long-standing debate about samson raphael hirsch some haredim and some on the right wing of modern orthodoxy believe that hirsch only wanted jews to combine an observant jewish lifestyle with learning the surrounding gentile society 's language , history , and science , so that a religious jew could operate in the surrounding secular society similarly , some scholars of soloveitchik 's philosophy maintain that an eclectic pragmatic approach was adopted by soloveitchik as well in contrast , liberal leaning scholars believe that this understanding of soloveitchik 's philosophy is misguided according to this view , soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for jews to learn secular philosophy , music , art , literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this certain burgeoning revisionisms may well attempt to disguise and distort the rav 's uniqueness by trivializing one or the other aspect of his rich personality and work , but they must be confronted at once according to walter wurzburger , soloveitchik counselled orthodox rabbis against this practice , insisting that non-orthodox have the option to use mikvaot ( wurzburger , 1994 ) on repentance ( hebrew '' al hateshuva '' , jerusalem 1979 ) ; the major points of rabbi soloveitchik 's teachings on teshuvah ( repentance ) , based on his annual series of lectures on this theme , as redacted by prof

the neuroscientist antonio damasio , distinguishes between emotions and feelings , respectively : the mental images ( i.e events and experiences are done and relived to satisfy one 's feelings details and information about the past is used to make decisions , as past experiences of feelings tend to influence current decision-making , how people will feel in the future , and if they want to feel that way again the organismic emotion is the outburst of emotions and feelings in interactive emotion , unlike in organismic emotion , the individual is aware of their decision on how they feel and how they show it like actors , individuals can control how emotions are expressed , but they can not control their inner emotions or feelings individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings when one is in a good state of feeling , they never want it to end ; conversely , when someone is in a bad state , they want that feeling to disappear some people inflict self-harm to punish themselves for feeling a certain way gut feelings are generally regarded as not modulated by conscious thought , but sometimes as a feature of intuition rather than rationality the way that we see other people express their emotions or feelings determines how we respond the way an individual responds to a situation is based on feeling rules emotion work allows individuals to change their feelings to suit the current situation since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal , they are constantly working on their feelings in order to fit the situation feelings are not permanent , but an ongoing thing because people constantly try to bring up , suppress , or manage feelings middle-class children get reprimanded for feeling the wrong way and lower-class children are punished for behaving badly

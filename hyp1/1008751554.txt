native americans mixed beans , maple sugar , and bear fat in earthenware pots which they placed in underground '' bean holes '' which were lined in hot rocks to cook slowly over a long period of time british colonists in new england were the first westerners to adopt the dish from the native peoples ; and were quick to embrace it largely because the dish was reminiscent of peas porridge and because the dish used ingredients native to the new world they substituted molasses or sugar for the maple syrup , bacon or ham for the bear fat , and simmered their beans for hours in pots over the fire instead of underground each colony in america had its own regional variations of the dish , with navy or white pea beans used in massachusetts , jacob 's cattle and soldier beans used in maine , and yellow-eyed beans in vermont this variation likely resulted from the colonists receiving the dish from different native peoples who used different native beans while some historians have theorized that baked beans had originated from the cassoulet or bean stew tradition in southern france , this is unlikely as the beans used to make baked beans are all native to south america and were introduced to europe around 1528 a dish which was a clear precursor to baked beans , entitled '' beans and bacon '' , was known in medieval england the addition of onion and mustard to some baked beans recipes published in new england in the 19th century was likely based on traditional cassoulet recipes from staffordshire , england which utilized mustard , beans , and leeks these ingredients are still often added to baked beans today originally baked beans were sweetened with maple syrup by native americans , a tradition some recipes still follow , but some english colonists modified the sweetening agent to brown sugar beginning in the 17th century the molasses style of baked beans has become closely associated with the city of boston , and is often referred to as boston baked beans today in the new england region , baked beans are flavored either with maple syrup ( northern new england ) , or with molasses ( boston ) , and are traditionally cooked with salt pork in a beanpot in a brick oven for six to eight hours today , baked beans can be made in a slow cooker or in a modern oven using a traditional beanpot , dutch oven , or casserole dish originally , heinz baked beans were prepared in the traditional united states manner for sales in ireland and great britain it is this version of baked beans which is most commonly used outside of the united states baked beans are commonly eaten on toast or as part of a full breakfast united kingdom and ireland today , baked beans are a staple convenience food in the uk , often eaten as part of the modern english breakfast and particularly on toast ( called simply '' beans on toast '' ) in mexico and latin america baked beans are also popular : black beans ( frijoles negros ) and frijoles pintos ( pinto beans ) are the most common

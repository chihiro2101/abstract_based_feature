according to chef and food historian walter staib of philadelphia 's city tavern , baked beans had its roots as a native peoples dish in the americas long before the dish became known to western culture british colonists in new england were the first westerners to adopt the dish from the native peoples ; and were quick to embrace it largely because the dish was reminiscent of peas porridge and because the dish used ingredients native to the new world each colony in america had its own regional variations of the dish , with navy or white pea beans used in massachusetts , jacob 's cattle and soldier beans used in maine , and yellow-eyed beans in vermont this variation likely resulted from the colonists receiving the dish from different native peoples who used different native beans while some historians have theorized that baked beans had originated from the cassoulet or bean stew tradition in southern france , this is unlikely as the beans used to make baked beans are all native to south america and were introduced to europe around 1528 a dish which was a clear precursor to baked beans , entitled '' beans and bacon '' , was known in medieval england the addition of onion and mustard to some baked beans recipes published in new england in the 19th century was likely based on traditional cassoulet recipes from staffordshire , england which utilized mustard , beans , and leeks nineteenth century cookbooks published in new england , spread to other portions united states and canada , which familiarized other people with the dish originally baked beans were sweetened with maple syrup by native americans , a tradition some recipes still follow , but some english colonists modified the sweetening agent to brown sugar beginning in the 17th century in the 18th century the convention of using american made molasses as a sweetening agent became increasingly popular in order to avoid british taxes on sugar today , baked beans can be made in a slow cooker or in a modern oven using a traditional beanpot , dutch oven , or casserole dish the already-cooked beans may also be baked in a casserole dish topped with slices of raw bacon , which is baked until the bacon is cooked canned baked beans with small pork sausages is also available the first mass-produced commercial canning of baked beans in the united states began in 1895 by the pennsylvania-based h over time , the recipe was altered to a less sweet tomato sauce without maple syrup , molasses , or brown sugar in order to appeal to the tastes of the united kingdom it is this version of baked beans which is most commonly used outside of the united states baked beans are commonly eaten on toast or as part of a full breakfast united kingdom and ireland '' franks and beans '' , a recipe wherein hot dogs are cut up and cooked in the same sauce as the baked beans

british forces engaged in the battle were commanded by major general james wolfe who commanded appx 8,000 troops , of which only 4,500 men and 1 gun were taken to the plains of abraham french forces engaged in the battle were commanded by major general marquis de montcalm commanding appx bougainville , tasked with the defence of the large area between cap diamant and cap rouge , was upstream with his troops at cap rouge on the night of 12 september , and missed seeing numerous british ships moving downstream sentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning , but they were expecting a french supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without vergor being notified the boats , however , had drifted slightly off course : instead of landing at the base of the road , many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope a group of 24 volunteers led by colonel william howe with fixed bayonets were sent to clear the picket along the road , and climbed the slope , a maneuver that allowed them to come up behind vergor 's camp and capture it quickly thus , by the time the sun rose over the plains of abraham , wolfe 's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the promontory of quebec left the plateau was undefended save for vergor 's camp , as vaudreuil had ordered one of the french regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing had the immediate defenders been more numerous , the british might have been unable to deploy or even been pushed back . though he might have awaited reinforcement by bougainville 's column ( allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the british position ) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces , or even yielded the city to wolfe , he instead elected to confront wolfe 's force directly in total , montcalm had 13,390 regular troops , troupes de la marine , and militia available in quebec city and along the beauport shore , as well as 200 cavalry , 200 artillery ( including the guns of quebec ) , 300 first nations ( including many odawa under charles de langlade on the morning of 13 september , wolfe 's army formed a line first with their backs to the river , then spread out across the plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the st while the regular french forces were approaching from beauport and quebec , the canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the british left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st . of the british troops , approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across the width of the plains , the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long in order to cover the entire plain , wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep , rather than the more conventional three ranks the defenders pushed the british from one house , but were repelled and , in retreat , lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands . as wolfe 's men waited for the defenders , the steady fire became intense enough that wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position accordingly , he deployed the forces immediately available in and near quebec city and prepared an immediate attack , without waiting for further reinforcements from the beauport shore the 78th fraser highlanders were ordered by brigadier-general james murray to pursue the french with their swords , but were met near the city by a heavy fire from a floating battery covering the bridge over the st 186 townshend took charge of the british forces and realised that bougainville 's column was approaching from the british rear , having taken some time to arrive from cap rouge decided to abandon quebec and the beauport shore , ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with bougainville , leaving the garrison in quebec under the command of jean-baptiste nicolas roch de ramezay the french had defeated the british , but the british were able to withdraw within the walls of quebec , to which the french laid siege

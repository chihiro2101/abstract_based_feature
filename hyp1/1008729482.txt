british forces engaged in the battle were commanded by major general james wolfe who commanded appx french forces engaged in the battle were commanded by major general marquis de montcalm commanding appx a camp of approximately 100 militia led by captain louis du pont duchambon de vergor , who had unsuccessfully faced the british four years previously at fort beauséjour , had been assigned to watch the narrow road at l'anse-au-foulon which followed a streambank , the coulée saint-denis sentries did detect boats moving along the river that morning , but they were expecting a french supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without vergor being notified the boats , however , had drifted slightly off course : instead of landing at the base of the road , many soldiers found themselves at the base of a slope wolfe followed an hour later when he could use an easy access road to climb to the plain thus , by the time the sun rose over the plains of abraham , wolfe 's army had a solid foothold at the top of the cliffs of the promontory of quebec left the plateau was undefended save for vergor 's camp , as vaudreuil had ordered one of the french regiments to relocate to the east of the city not long before the landing an officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to on the night of the 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame . saunders had staged a diversionary action off montmorency , firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops , many of them taken from field hospitals ; this preoccupied montcalm . though he might have awaited reinforcement by bougainville 's column ( allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the british position ) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces , or even yielded the city to wolfe , he instead elected to confront wolfe 's force directly had he waited , the british would have been entirely cut off—they had nowhere to go but back down the foulon , and would have been under fire the entire way on the morning of 13 september , wolfe 's army formed a line first with their backs to the river , then spread out across the plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the st while the regular french forces were approaching from beauport and quebec , the canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the british left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st . of the british troops , approximately 3,300 formed into a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across the width of the plains , the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long in order to cover the entire plain , wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep , rather than the more conventional three ranks on the left wing , regiments under townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line . as wolfe 's men waited for the defenders , the steady fire became intense enough that wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position accordingly , he deployed the forces immediately available in and near quebec city and prepared an immediate attack , without waiting for further reinforcements from the beauport shore . with wolfe dead and several other key officers injured , british troops fell into a disorganised pursuit of the retreating french troops within days , on 18 september , de ramezay , townshend and saunders signed the articles of capitulation of quebec and the city was turned over to british control the french had defeated the british , but the british were able to withdraw within the walls of quebec , to which the french laid siege . the success of the french army 's offensive against quebec in the spring of 1760 had depended on the dispatch of a french armada , with fresh troops and supplies

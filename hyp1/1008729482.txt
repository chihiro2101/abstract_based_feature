the enemy is entrenching , he already has two pieces of cannon in total , montcalm had 13,390 regular troops , troupes de la marine , and militia available in quebec city and along the beauport shore , as well as 200 cavalry , 200 artillery ( including the guns of quebec ) , 300 first nations ( including many odawa under charles de langlade on the morning of 13 september , wolfe 's army formed a line first with their backs to the river , then spread out across the plains with its right anchored by the bluff along the st while the regular french forces were approaching from beauport and quebec , the canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the british left flank , sheltering in the trees and scrub ; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat , eventually holding the bridge over the st the defenders pushed the british from one house , but were repelled and , in retreat , lit several houses on fire to keep them out of enemy hands . as wolfe 's men waited for the defenders , the steady fire became intense enough that wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush watercolour by charles william jefferys ( 1869–1951 ) as french troops arrived from beauport , montcalm , one of few mounted men on the field , decided that a swift assault was the only way to dislodge the british from their position accordingly , he deployed the forces immediately available in and near quebec city and prepared an immediate attack , without waiting for further reinforcements from the beauport shore . thumb wolfe , positioned with the 28th foot and the louisbourg grenadiers , had moved to a rise to observe the battle ;

the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction if the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form , only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency instead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell , an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion , the '' spike '' , which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike as the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes , the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases , as does the drag in front of the vehicle in the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim this design has the advantage of being stackable , allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control this work on aerospike engines continues ; prospector-10 , a ten-chamber aerospike engine , was test-fired june 25 , 2008 a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket

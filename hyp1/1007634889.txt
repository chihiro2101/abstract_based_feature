the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient , this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle it gives no overall thrust , but this part of the nozzle also does n't lose thrust by forming a partial vacuum the thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude an engine of this type is on outdoor display on the grounds of the nasa marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama csulb students had developed their prospector 2 ( p-2 ) rocket using a 1,000 & nbsp ; lb f ( 4.4 & nbsp ; kn ) lox/ethanol aerospike engine the plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out of thrust they later announced that their executor aerospike engine would produce of thrust at sea level and of thrust in a vacuum in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket

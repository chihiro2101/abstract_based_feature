the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction the bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine an aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient , this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle the thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude the recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar , higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle , thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases the rs-2200 linear aerospike engine was derived from the xrs-2200 this work on aerospike engines continues ; prospector-10 , a ten-chamber aerospike engine , was test-fired june 25 , 2008 a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine another spike engine concept model , by ksf space and interstellar space in los angeles , was designed for orbital vehicle named satori

the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike it gives no overall thrust , but this part of the nozzle also does n't lose thrust by forming a partial vacuum the thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude as the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes , the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases , as does the drag in front of the vehicle three xrs-2200 engines were built during the x-33 program and underwent testing at nasa 's stennis space center the rs-2200 linear aerospike engine was derived from the xrs-2200 this work on aerospike engines continues ; prospector-10 , a ten-chamber aerospike engine , was test-fired june 25 , 2008 the engine has a bell-shaped nozzle that has been cut in half , then stretched to form a ring with the half-nozzle now forming the profile of a plug a new company , firefly aerospace , has replaced the aerospike engine with a conventional engine in the alpha 2.0 design they later announced that their executor aerospike engine would produce of thrust at sea level and of thrust in a vacuum another spike engine concept model , by ksf space and interstellar space in los angeles , was designed for orbital vehicle named satori

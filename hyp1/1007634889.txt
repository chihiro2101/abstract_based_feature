the purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction , generating thrust in the opposite direction the bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust , helping to keep it moving in the '' right '' direction as it exits the engine , outward from the main exhaust plume ) , the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine the idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient as the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes , the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases , as does the drag in front of the vehicle the recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 bar , higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle , thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases in the toroidal aerospike the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim this work on aerospike engines continues ; prospector-10 , a ten-chamber aerospike engine , was test-fired june 25 , 2008 in march 2017 arca space corporation announced their intention to build a single-stage-to-orbit rocket ( ssto ) , named haas 2ca , using a linear aerospike engine in june 2017 , arca announced that they would fly their demonstrator3 rocket to space , also using a linear aerospike engine in september 2017 , arca announced that , after being delayed , their linear aerospike engine was ready to perform ground tests and flight tests on a demonstrator3 rocket another spike engine concept model , by ksf space and interstellar space in los angeles , was designed for orbital vehicle named satori

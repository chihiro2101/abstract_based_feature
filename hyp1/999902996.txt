critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are : use of ( often implicit ) resource dependencies , having the overall shortest critical chain ) the inherent uncertainty in estimates is much greater than the difference between the optimum and near-optimum ( '' good enough '' solutions ) critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e a project plan or work breakdown structure ( wbs ) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path when the plan is complete and the project is ready to start , the project network is fixed and the buffers ' sizes are '' locked '' ( i.e instead , we monitor the buffers created during the planning stage

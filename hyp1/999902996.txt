critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time projects typically complete at 222 % of the duration originally planned , 189 % of the original budgeted cost , 70 % of projects fall short of their planned scope ( technical content delivered ) , and 30 % are cancelled before completion harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project using monte carlo simulation , the project manager can apply different probabilities for various risk factors that affect a project component because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law a fever chart or similar graph can be created and posted to show the consumption of buffer as a function of project completion when the buffer consumption rate exceeds some critical value ( roughly : the rate where all of the buffer may be expected to be consumed before the end of the project , resulting in late completion ) , then those alternative plans need to be implemented

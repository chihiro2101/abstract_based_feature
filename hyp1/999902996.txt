critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints goldratt 's book , critical chain application of ccpm has been credited with achieving projects 10 % to 50 % faster and/or cheaper than the traditional methods ( i.e according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time with traditional project management methods , 30 % of lost time and resources are typically consumed by wasteful techniques such as bad multitasking ( in particular task switching ) , student syndrome , parkinson 's law , in-box delays , and lack of prioritization harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method critical chain is an alternative to critical path analysis critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading , because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint ( i.e the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project when the plan is complete and the project is ready to start , the project network is fixed and the buffers ' sizes are '' locked '' ( i.e

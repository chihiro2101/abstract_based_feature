critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are : use of ( often implicit ) resource dependencies , having the overall shortest critical chain ) critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project a project plan or work breakdown structure ( wbs ) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path the longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain recognizing that tasks are more likely to take more time than less time due to parkinson 's law , student syndrome , or other reasons , ccpm uses '' buffers '' to monitor project schedule and financial performance when the plan is complete and the project is ready to start , the project network is fixed and the buffers ' sizes are '' locked '' ( i.e in some case studies , actual batons are reportedly hung by the desks of people when they are working on critical chain tasks so that others know not to interrupt because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law

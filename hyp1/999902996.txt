critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from theory of constraints goldratt 's book , critical chain according to studies of traditional project management methods by standish group and others as of 1998 , only 44 % of projects typically finish on time harvey maylor , project management in a project plan , the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time , given finite resources if resources are always available in unlimited quantities , then a project 's critical chain is identical to its critical path method main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are : use of ( often implicit ) resource dependencies critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project the '' extra '' duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the '' safe '' durations and the 50 % durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project using monte carlo simulation , the project manager can apply different probabilities for various risk factors that affect a project component , their planned duration may not be altered during the project ) , because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance the ccpm literature contrasts this with '' traditional '' project management that monitors task start and completion dates because task duration has been planned at the 50 % probability duration , there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible , overcoming student 's syndrome and parkinson 's law

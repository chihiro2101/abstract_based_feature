in the mid 360s bc , timophanes , the brother of timoleon , took possession of the acropolis of corinth and effectively made himself tyrant of the city timoleon , being named by an unknown voice in the corinthian popular assembly , was chosen by a unanimous vote to undertake the mission he set sail for sicily with seven ships , a few of the leading citizens of corinth , and a small force of 700 greek mercenaries at this time hicetas , tyrant of leontini , was master of syracuse , with the exception of the island of ortygia , which was occupied by dionysius ii , still nominally ruler after his initial , unexpected success , timoleon was sent reinforcements from corinth and some north-western greek states following the siege of syracuse , dionysius ii surrendered ortygia in 343 bc on the condition of his being granted a safe conduct to corinth , where he ended his life as a private , well-off , citizen hicetas now received help from carthage ( 60,000 men ) , but ill-success roused mutual suspicion ; the carthaginians abandoned hicetas , who was besieged in leontini , and who was then compelled to surrender hicetas persuaded carthage to send ( 340–339 bc ) a great army ( 70,000 men ) , which landed at lilybaeum ( now marsala ) later , carthage dispatched mercenaries to prolong the conflict between timoleon and the greek tyrants a treaty in 338 bc was agreed upon , by which carthage was confined in sicily to the west of the halycus ( platani ) and undertook to give no further help to sicilian tyrants timoleon 's personal conduct throughout his life suggests a commitment to freedom and the rule of law timoleon and the revival of greek sicily , 344–317 b.c

by 1403 only a handful of castles , including harlech , still stood against the rebels , but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege , the garrison having just three shields , eight helmets , six lances , ten pairs of gloves , and four guns harlech became his residence , family home and military headquarters for four years ; he held his second parliament in harlech in august 1405 in 1408 english forces under the command of the future henry v placed harlech and its commander , edmund mortimer , under siege , conducting a bombardment with cannon , probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls when this failed to take the castle , henry left john talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with aberystwyth castle the castle became a base for their operations across the region : there were planned operations in 1464 , sir richard tunstall mounted attacks from harlech in 1466 and jasper tudor landed there with french reinforcements in 1468 , before then raiding the town of denbigh harlech was declared part of the castles and town walls of king edward in gwynedd world heritage site in 1986 , unesco considering harlech one of '' the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in europe '' harlech castle rests upon part of the rhinogydd , a spur of rock almost high ; the land falls away sharply on the north and west , and a ditch cut into the rock protects the remaining approaches to the castle the main entrance to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse ; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge each floor has three large windows overlooking the inner ward ; the second floor has two additional grand windows on the sides of the gatehouse ; the gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys the use of these rooms has been the subject of academic debate : historian arnold taylor argued that the first floor of the gatehouse was used by the constable as living accommodation , with the second floor used by senior visitors ; jeremy ashbee has since challenged this interpretation , suggesting the high status accommodation may instead have been in the inner ward , and the gatehouse used for other purposes

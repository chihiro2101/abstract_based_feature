by 1403 only a handful of castles , including harlech , still stood against the rebels , but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege , the garrison having just three shields , eight helmets , six lances , ten pairs of gloves , and four guns harlech became his residence , family home and military headquarters for four years ; he held his second parliament in harlech in august 1405 when this failed to take the castle , henry left john talbot in charge of the siege and moved on to deal with aberystwyth castle thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea , harlech held out and as other fortresses fell , eventually became the last major stronghold still under lancastrian control the castle became a base for their operations across the region : there were planned operations in 1464 , sir richard tunstall mounted attacks from harlech in 1466 and jasper tudor landed there with french reinforcements in 1468 , before then raiding the town of denbigh harlech apparently had not been repaired following the 1468 siege , and had become completely dilapidated , with the exception of the gatehouse , which was used for the local assizes the castle has a concentric castle , with one line of defences enclosed by another , forming an inner and outer ward ; the outer wall was originally somewhat taller than today harlech is built from local grey-green sandstone , with large , regular blocks used for the towers and irregular material , possibly taken from the ditch , used for the walls each floor has three large windows overlooking the inner ward ; the second floor has two additional grand windows on the sides of the gatehouse ; the gatehouse was fitted with fireplaces and would originally have had prominent chimneys the links between the harlech and savoy are not straightforward , however , as in some cases the relevant savoy structures were built after james had left the region

zachary emigrated to the united states when he was twenty he spent time in montana and gary , indiana , before moving to michigan by the time john was born , zachary had found employment as a union organizer at the ford motor company factory in nearby highland park she was employed at the carboloy products division of general electric throughout much of delorean 's early life she took work wherever she could to supplement the family 's income john subsequently saw little of his father , who moved into a boarding house , becoming a solitary and estranged drug addict delorean found the cass experience exhilarating , and he excelled at his studies in 1943 , delorean was drafted for military service and served three years in the u.s instead of immediately entering the engineering workforce after earning his degree , delorean sold life insurance both endeavors were successful financially , but these areas held little interest for delorean a foreman at chrysler 's engineering garage recommended that delorean applies for work at chrysler and delorean agreed chrysler ran a post-graduate educational facility named the chrysler institute of engineering , which allowed delorean to advance his education while gaining real-world experience in automotive engineering delorean attended night classes at the university of michigan 's ross school of business to earn credits for his mba degree , which he completed in 1957 delorean 's time at chrysler lasted less than a year , ending in 1953 when he was offered a salary of us 14,000 at packard under the supervision of the engineer forest mcfarland delorean quickly gained the attention of his new employer with an improvement to the ultramatic automatic transmission , giving it an improved torque converter and dual-drive ranges ; it was launched as the '' twin-ultramatic '' however , it proved to have a positive effect on delorean 's attention to engineering detail , and after four years at packard he became mcfarland 's successor as head of research and development james nance , president of packard , decided to merge the company with studebaker in 1954 delorean considered keeping his job and moving to studebaker headquarters in south bend , indiana , when he received a call from oliver k kelley , vice president of engineering at general motors , a man whom delorean greatly admired kelley called to offer delorean his choice of a job in any of five divisions of gm delorean 's years of engineering at pontiac were successful , producing dozens of patented innovations for the company , and in 1961 he was promoted to the position of division chief engineer delorean 's most notable contribution to pontiac was the pontiac gto ( gran turismo omologato ) , a muscle car named after the ferrari 250 gto in response to the '' pony car '' market dominated by the wildly successful ford mustang , delorean asked gm executives for permission to market a smaller version of the pontiac banshee show car for 1966 delorean 's version was rejected because of gm 's concern that his design would take away sales from the corvette , their flagship performance vehicle sales were sagging by this time , however , but the 1969 model would have its own distinct body shell with drivetrain and chassis components from the intermediate-sized pontiac a-body ( tempest , lemans , gto ) delorean knew pontiac division could n't finance the new car alone , so he went to his former boss pete estes and asked to share the cost of development with pontiac , having a one-year exclusivity before chevrolet would release the 1970 monte carlo the interior included a wraparound cockpit-style instrument panel , bucket seats and center console this time it was to head up the prestigious chevrolet division , general motors ' flagship marque delorean was a limited partner in a pair of american professional sports franchises the other was the new york yankees , of which he was one of fifteen investors led by george steinbrenner and michael burke , who completed the purchase from cbs for 10 million on january 3 , 1973 aubrey , president of metro-goldwyn-mayer studios , and was introduced to celebrities such as financier kirk kerkorian , chris-craft chairman herb siegel , entertainer sammy davis jr by 1971 , chevrolet was experiencing record sales in excess of 3 million vehicles , and his division alone was nearly matching that of the entire ford motor company by delorean 's orders , dozens of extra inspectors were assigned to the vega assembly line and the first two thousand cars were road-tested '' but in 1972 , general motors assembly division ( gmad ) took over the chevrolet lordstown assembly plant and adjoining fisher body plant incomplete and often non-functioning cars soon filled the factory lot , which then had to be reprocessed and repaired by a team assigned to this task by delorean delorean regrouped for the 1973 model year with vega sales of 395,792 this was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public , who generally felt the uniqueness of the delorean 's styling did not compensate for the higher price and lower horsepower relative to other sport coupes on the market hoffman ( whose name was redacted on the original indictment ) also stated that he was aware of delorean 's financial troubles before he contacted him , and had heard him admit that he needed us 17 million '' in a hurry '' to prevent dmc 's imminent insolvency the film chronicles john delorean throughout the launch of his delorean sports car in 1981 delorean : living the dream ( 2014 ) , chronicles the history of the iconic delorean automobile from the rise and fall of legendary automaker john z car crash : the delorean story ( 2004 ) , a bbc television documentary about the rise and fall of the delorean motor company

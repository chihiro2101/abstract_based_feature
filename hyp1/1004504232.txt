a 2016 study found that '' trade typically favors the poor '' , as they spend a greater share of their earnings on goods , as free trade reduces the costs of goods according to economic historians findlay and o'rourke , there is a consensus in the economics literature that protectionist policies in the interwar period '' hurt the world economy overall , although there is a debate about whether the effect was large or small '' economic historian paul bairoch argued that economic protection was positively correlated with economic and industrial growth during the 19th century for example , gnp growth during europe 's '' liberal period '' in the middle of the century ( where tariffs were at their lowest ) , averaged 1.7 % per year , while industrial growth averaged 1.8 % per year however , during the protectionist era of the 1870s and 1890s , gnp growth averaged 2.6 % per year , while industrial output grew at 3.8 % per year , roughly twice as fast as it had during the liberal era of low tariffs and free trade one study found that tariffs imposed on manufactured goods increase economic growth in developing countries , and this growth impact remains even after the tariffs are repealed '' according to oxford economic historian kevin o'rourke , '' it seems clear that protection was important for the growth of us manufacturing in the first half of the 19th century ; but this does not necessarily imply that the tariff was beneficial for gdp growth protectionists have often pointed to german and american industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position , but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy , and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth proponents of this theory point to the constant warfare in the 17th and 18th centuries among european countries whose governments were predominantly mercantilism and protectionist , the american revolution , which came about ostensibly due to british tariffs and taxes , as well as the protective policies preceding both world war i and world war ii since the end of world war ii , it has been the stated policy of most first world countries to eliminate protectionism through free trade policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the world trade organization american system ( economic plan ) autarky brexit currency war developmentalism digital millennium copyright act economic nationalism free trade debate globalization henry c

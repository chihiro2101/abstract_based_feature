a 2016 study found that '' trade typically favors the poor '' , as they spend a greater share of their earnings on goods , as free trade reduces the costs of goods we have to recognize that erecting trade barriers will help in only a limited set of circumstances and that trade policy will rarely be the best response to the problems of globalization '' according to economic historians findlay and o'rourke , there is a consensus in the economics literature that protectionist policies in the interwar period '' hurt the world economy overall , although there is a debate about whether the effect was large or small '' economic historian paul bairoch argued that economic protection was positively correlated with economic and industrial growth during the 19th century for example , gnp growth during europe 's '' liberal period '' in the middle of the century ( where tariffs were at their lowest ) , averaged 1.7 % per year , while industrial growth averaged 1.8 % per year however , during the protectionist era of the 1870s and 1890s , gnp growth averaged 2.6 % per year , while industrial output grew at 3.8 % per year , roughly twice as fast as it had during the liberal era of low tariffs and free trade one study found that tariffs imposed on manufactured goods increase economic growth in developing countries , and this growth impact remains even after the tariffs are repealed protectionists have often pointed to german and american industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position , but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy , and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth romer found , contrary to free trade skeptics ' claims , while controlling for relevant factors , that trade does indeed have a positive impact on growth and incomes economists such as paul krugman have speculated that those who support protectionism ostensibly to further the interests of workers in the least developed countries are in fact being disingenuous , seeking only to protect jobs in developed countries since the end of world war ii , it has been the stated policy of most first world countries to eliminate protectionism through free trade policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the world trade organization

a 2016 study found that '' trade typically favors the poor '' , as they spend a greater share of their earnings on goods , as free trade reduces the costs of goods harvard economist dani rodrik argues that while globalization and free trade does contribute to social problems , '' a serious retreat into protectionism would hurt the many groups that benefit from trade and would result in the same kind of social conflicts that globalization itself generates we have to recognize that erecting trade barriers will help in only a limited set of circumstances and that trade policy will rarely be the best response to the problems of globalization '' '' economic historian paul bairoch argued that economic protection was positively correlated with economic and industrial growth during the 19th century however , during the protectionist era of the 1870s and 1890s , gnp growth averaged 2.6 % per year , while industrial output grew at 3.8 % per year , roughly twice as fast as it had during the liberal era of low tariffs and free trade one study found that tariffs imposed on manufactured goods increase economic growth in developing countries , and this growth impact remains even after the tariffs are repealed protectionists have often pointed to german and american industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position , but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy , and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth there is broad consensus among economists that free trade helps workers in developing countries , even though they are not subject to the stringent health and labor standards of developed countries the nobel laureates , milton friedman and paul krugman , have argued for free trade as a model for economic development mainstream economists do concede that tariffs can in the short-term help domestic industries to develop , but are contingent on the short-term nature of the protective tariffs and the ability of the government to pick the winners since the end of world war ii , it has been the stated policy of most first world countries to eliminate protectionism through free trade policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the world trade organization

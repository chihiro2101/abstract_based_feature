a 2016 study found that '' trade typically favors the poor '' , as they spend a greater share of their earnings on goods , as free trade reduces the costs of goods harvard economist dani rodrik argues that while globalization and free trade does contribute to social problems , '' a serious retreat into protectionism would hurt the many groups that benefit from trade and would result in the same kind of social conflicts that globalization itself generates we have to recognize that erecting trade barriers will help in only a limited set of circumstances and that trade policy will rarely be the best response to the problems of globalization '' according to economic historians findlay and o'rourke , there is a consensus in the economics literature that protectionist policies in the interwar period '' hurt the world economy overall , although there is a debate about whether the effect was large or small however , during the protectionist era of the 1870s and 1890s , gnp growth averaged 2.6 % per year , while industrial output grew at 3.8 % per year , roughly twice as fast as it had during the liberal era of low tariffs and free trade one study found that tariffs imposed on manufactured goods increase economic growth in developing countries , and this growth impact remains even after the tariffs are repealed '' irwin furthermore writes that '' few observers have argued outright that the high tariffs caused such growth '' according to oxford economic historian kevin o'rourke , '' it seems clear that protection was important for the growth of us manufacturing in the first half of the 19th century ; but this does not necessarily imply that the tariff was beneficial for gdp growth protectionists have often pointed to german and american industrialization during this period as evidence in favor of their position , but economic growth is influenced by many factors other than trade policy , and it is important to control for these when assessing the links between tariffs and growth romer found , contrary to free trade skeptics ' claims , while controlling for relevant factors , that trade does indeed have a positive impact on growth and incomes since the end of world war ii , it has been the stated policy of most first world countries to eliminate protectionism through free trade policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the world trade organization

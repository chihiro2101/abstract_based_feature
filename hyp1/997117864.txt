a '' writ of prohibition '' , in the united states , is an official legal document drafted and issued by a supreme court , superior court or an appeals court to a judge presiding over a suit in an inferior court the writ of prohibition mandates the inferior court to cease any action over the case because it may not fall within that inferior court 's jurisdiction in some cases , this writ may also be used to prevent an inferior court from acting contrary to the rules of natural justice writs of prohibition are similar to writs of certiorari , as both types of writs allow superior courts to manage inferior courts however , unlike a writ of prohibition , superior courts issue writs of certiorari to review decisions which inferior courts have already made a writ of prohibition is issued primarily to prevent an inferior court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction in cases pending before it or acting contrary to the rules of natural justice it is issued by a superior court to inferior courts from usurping a jurisdiction with which it was not legally vested , or in other words to compel inferior courts to keep within the limits of their jurisdiction thus the writ is issued in both cases where there is excess of jurisdiction and where there is absence of jurisdiction the writ can be issued only when the proceedings are pending in a court if the proceeding has matured into decision , writ will not lie when the court , before whom the matter is pending , has ceased to exist , in that condition too , the writ of prohibition will not lie because there can be no proceedings upon which it can operate but on the other hand , if the court is functioning , the writ can be issued at any stage of the proceeding before the inferior court or tribunal as the common law courts became more formalized and rigid in their procedure and jurisprudence , they also ceased using the writ of prohibition as a remedy against individual defendants alternatively , the parties could seek to reverse the writ of prohibition by seeking a writ of consultation if the chancellor agreed , he could issue a writ of consultation , reversing the writ of prohibition and allowing the case to continue in the ecclesiastical court

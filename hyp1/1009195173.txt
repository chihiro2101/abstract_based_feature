currency for international travel and cross-border payments is predominantly purchased from banks , foreign exchange brokerages and various forms of bureaux de change one form of charge is the use of an exchange rate that is less favourable than the wholesale spot rate for example , in a conversion from eur to aud , eur is the fixed currency , aud is the variable currency and the exchange rate indicates how many australian dollars would be paid or received for 1 euro quotation using a country 's home currency as the price currency is known as direct quotation or price quotation ( from that country 's perspective ) for example , eur 0.8989 usd 1.00 in the eurozone understanding foreign exchange : exchange rates and is used in most countries using direct quotation , if the home currency is strengthening ( that is , appreciating , or becoming more valuable ) then the exchange rate number decreases although there is no fixed rule , exchange rates numerically greater than around 20 were usually quoted to three decimal places and exchange rates greater than 80 were quoted to two decimal places in 2005 , barclays capital broke with convention by quoting spot exchange rates with five or six decimal places on their electronic dealing platform the contraction of spreads ( the difference between the bid and ask rates ) arguably necessitated finer pricing and gave the banks the ability to try and win transactions on multibank trading platforms where all banks may otherwise have been quoting the same price the main types of exchange rate regimes are : free-floating , pegged ( fixed ) , or a hybrid exchange rates for such currencies are likely to change almost constantly as quoted on financial markets , mainly by banks , around the world selling rate : also known as the foreign exchange selling price , it refers to the exchange rate used by the bank to sell foreign exchange to customers middle rate : the average of the bid price and the ask price ; according to the length of delivery after foreign exchange transactions : spot exchange rate : refers to the exchange rate of spot foreign exchange transactions that is , after the foreign exchange transaction is completed , the exchange rate in delivery within two working days the exchange rate that is generally listed on the foreign exchange market is generally referred to as the spot exchange rate unless it specifically indicates the forward exchange rate forward foreign exchange trading is an appointment-based transaction , which is due to the different time the foreign exchange purchaser needs for foreign exchange funds and the introduction of foreign exchange risk the forward exchange rate is based on the spot exchange rate , which is represented by the “ premium ” , “ discount ” , and “ parity ” of the spot exchange rate compare it with the currency of the country and set the exchange rate this exchange rate is the basic exchange rate cross rate : after the basic exchange rate is worked out , the exchange rate of the local currency against other foreign currencies can be calculated through the basic exchange rate the resulting exchange rate is the cross exchange rate market rate : the market exchange rate refers to the real exchange rate for trading foreign exchange in the free market ; according to the international exchange rate regime : fixed exchange rate : it means that the exchange rate between a country 's currency and another country 's currency is basically fixed , and the fluctuation of exchange rate is very small the local currency is determined by the supply and demand relationship of the foreign exchange market , and it is free to rise and fall real exchange rate : the nominal exchange rate eliminating inflation balance of payments : when a country has a large international balance of payments deficit or trade deficit , it means that its foreign exchange earnings are less than foreign exchange expenditures and its demand for foreign exchange exceeds its supply , so its foreign exchange rate rises , and its currency depreciates inflation factor : the inflation rate of a country rises , the purchasing power of money declines , the paper currency depreciates internally , and then the foreign currency appreciates the currency exchange rate immediately fall speculation is an important factor in the short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate of the foreign exchange market the foreign exchange supply and demand has caused the exchange rate to change economic strength of a country : in general , high economic growth rates are not conducive to the local currency 's performance in the foreign exchange market in the short term , but in the long run , they strongly support the strong momentum of the local currency research on target zones has mainly concentrated on the benefit of stability of exchange rates for industrial countries , but some studies have argued that volatile bilateral exchange rates between industrial countries are in part responsible for financial crisis in emerging markets two of the most popular approaches in the economic literature are the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate ( feer ) , developed by williamson ( 1994 ) , and the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate ( beer ) , initially estimated by clark and macdonald ( 1998 ) in many countries there is a distinction between the official exchange rate for permitted transactions and a parallel exchange rate that responds to excess demand for foreign currency at the official exchange rate the spot market represents current exchange rates , whereas options are derivatives of exchange rates a lower exchange rate lowers the price of a country 's goods for consumers in other countries , but raises the price of imported goods and services for consumers in the low value currency country

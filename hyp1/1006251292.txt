imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one before him or her , however , were a group of children working in conjunction with the researchers an insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers ' behavior through pressure the study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers , and looked at their responses to potential techniques the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g sitting down on a mat for reading time ) , and if a student reached three points by the end of the day they would receive a prize the second part brought in peer interaction , where students who reached three points were appointed '' peer monitors '' whose role was to lead their small groups and assign points at the end of the day even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior , such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky , drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers , making them more susceptible to group pressures also available as : caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring , and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure allen and colleagues showed that susceptibility to peer pressure in 13- and 14-year-olds was predictive of not only future response to peer pressure , but also a wider array of functioning of note , substance use was also predicted by peer pressure susceptibility such that greater susceptibility was predictive of greater alcohol and drug use substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence for instance , in a study of nicotine use johnson and colleagues found that peer smoking had a lower effect on nicotine dependence for those with the high risk allele ( chrna5 ) this suggests that social contexts do not play the significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance as it may for others and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure using the resistance to peer influence scale , sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-old the higher vulnerability to peer pressure for teenage boys makes sense given the higher rates of substance use in male teens there are two reasons why people do it ; because everyone does it , or as a means to fit into social groups on entering college most people begin to increase their amount of alcohol intake , this is more so true to those who do not live at home substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure the literature regarding the efficacy of these approaches , however , is mixed found that programs in elementary school were successful in slightly reducing a student 's likelihood to abuse drugs or alcohol programs that targeted students in grades 8â€“9 reduced smoking , but not alcohol and other drug abuse , and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all . peer pressure and sexual intercourse these disparities are not due solely to parental disposition but also to communication a study completed in cape town , south africa , looked at students at four secondary schools in the region they found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure : condoms are derided , threats of ridicule for abstinence , and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol ( especially for males ) defined three types of peer norms that led to a person 's participation in sexual intercourse : descriptive norms , injunctive norms , and outright peer pressure the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group additionally , studies have found a link between self-regulation and likeliness to engage in sexual behavior the more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up , the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts the mpfc is active when determining '' socially tagged '' objects , which are objects that peers have expressed an opinion about ; the striatum is significant for determining the value of these '' socially tagged '' objects and rewards in general researchers conducted an experiment with adolescent males who were of driving age and measured their risk-taking depending on whether a passenger ( a peer of the same age ) was in the car a driving simulation was created , and certain risky scenarios , such as a decaying yellow light as the car was approaching , were modeled and presented to the subjects . peer pressure on social media across cultures peer pressure can , of course , operate on isolated individuals , or small groups , but it depends upon the majority wanting to do it instead of the typical peer pressure associated with western high school students , the peer pressure within the rwandan genocide , where tutsi and hutu have inter-married , worked under coercion as a result , when the war came , the hutu were already introduced to the concept of racism against their very own peers this suggests that peer pressure '' shames '' individuals for making smaller donations

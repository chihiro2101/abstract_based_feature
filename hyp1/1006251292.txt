imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc children are aware of their position in the social hierarchy from a young age : their instinct is to defer to adults ' judgements and majority opinions similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one however , when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers ' pressure , illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions an insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers ' behavior through pressure hill child development laboratory in the university of kansas designed a program to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system the study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers , and looked at their responses to potential techniques the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g the second part brought in peer interaction , where students who reached three points were appointed '' peer monitors '' whose role was to lead their small groups and assign points at the end of the day even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience children entering this period in life become aware for the first time of the other people around them and realize the importance of perception in their interactions peer conformity in young people is most pronounced with respect to style , taste , appearance , ideology , and values peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers affiliation with friends who engage in risk behaviors has been shown to be a strong predictor of an adolescent 's own behavior peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior , such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics even though socially accepted children often have the most opportunities and the most positive experiences , research shows that social acceptance ( being in the popular crowd ) may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior , depending on the norms in the group gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences : girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns peer pressure is widely recognized as a major contributor to the initiation of drug use , particularly in adolescence for example , parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use ; yet when there is little monitoring , adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use , but not during the transition from experimental to regular use also available as : caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring , and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure conversely , some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence in a nationally representative sample , adolescents who had genetic predisposition were more likely to have good friends who were heavy substance users and were furthermore , more likely to be vulnerable to the adverse influence of these friends for instance , in a study of nicotine use johnson and colleagues found that peer smoking had a lower effect on nicotine dependence for those with the high risk allele ( chrna5 ) though the impact of peer influence in adolescence has been well established , it was unclear at what age this effect begins to diminish it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure this study also found that girls were generally more resistant to peer influence than boys , particularly at mid-adolescence ( i.e parental social support , consistent discipline ) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances then you have the modeling which is being a “ copycat ” and following your friends then finally you have the social norms which are drinking there are two reasons why people do it ; because everyone does it , or as a means to fit into social groups substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure programs that targeted students in grades 8–9 reduced smoking , but not alcohol and other drug abuse , and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all in a non-substance context , however , research has showed that decision-making training can produce concrete gains in risk perception and decision-making ability among autistic children . peer pressure and sexual intercourse these disparities are not due solely to parental disposition but also to communication literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyze the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors the review found that indirect norms ( descriptive and injunctive ) had a stronger effect on a person 's decision to engage in sexual behavior than direct peer pressure between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group thus , one conforms to the group standard , but as soon as one does , eliminating this external conflict , internal conflict is introduced ( because one has violated one ’ s own standards ) these versions of digital peer pressure exist between youth , adults and businesses actions and influence on social media may lead to changes in identity , confidence , or habits in real life for children , adolescents , and adults instead of the typical peer pressure associated with western high school students , the peer pressure within the rwandan genocide , where tutsi and hutu have inter-married , worked under coercion compared to a baseline rate of 29.7 % ( only the voting reminder ) , the treatment that utilized peer pressure increased the percentage of household voters by 8.1 % ( to 37.8 % ) , which exceeds the value of in-person canvassing and personalized phone calls ” this study found a treatment effect of 1.0 percentage point , a statistically significant but far weaker effect than the 8.1 percentage point effect reported by gerber , green , and larimer

imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one each child was handed a book with two sets of images on each page , with a groups of differently sized animals on the left hand page and one animal on the right hand , and each child was asked to indicate the size of the lone animal when asked in the presence of the other children , the last child 's response was often the same as his or her peers an insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers ' behavior through pressure hill child development laboratory in the university of kansas designed a program to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system after describing a series of tasks to their classroom that included bathroom usage , cleaning up , and general classroom behavior , teachers and researchers would observe children 's performance on the tasks the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience peer conformity in young people is most pronounced with respect to style , taste , appearance , ideology , and values '' peer pressure '' , in : anthony s peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior , such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky , drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers , making them more susceptible to group pressures gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences : girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns additionally , girls and boys reported facing differing amounts of pressures in different areas of their lives , perhaps reflecting a different set of values and priorities for each gender peer pressure is widely recognized as a major contributor to the initiation of drug use , particularly in adolescence conversely , some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use for example , greater depression symptomatology , decreasing popularity , more sexual behavior , and externalizing behavior were greater for more susceptible teens evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence though the impact of peer influence in adolescence has been well established , it was unclear at what age this effect begins to diminish it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure using the resistance to peer influence scale , sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-old the higher vulnerability to peer pressure for teenage boys makes sense given the higher rates of substance use in male teens it is believed that peer pressure of excessive drinking in college comes down to three factors ; being offered alcohol , modeling and social norms then you have the modeling which is being a “ copycat ” and following your friends then finally you have the social norms which are drinking on entering college most people begin to increase their amount of alcohol intake , this is more so true to those who do not live at home one major technique is , naturally , peer influence resistance skills programs that targeted students in grades 8–9 reduced smoking , but not alcohol and other drug abuse , and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all they found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure : condoms are derided , threats of ridicule for abstinence , and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol ( especially for males ) an important solution for these problems is communication with adults , which the study found to be extremely lacking within adolescent social groups literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyze the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors defined three types of peer norms that led to a person 's participation in sexual intercourse : descriptive norms , injunctive norms , and outright peer pressure the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior the review found that indirect norms ( descriptive and injunctive ) had a stronger effect on a person 's decision to engage in sexual behavior than direct peer pressure between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group the more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up , the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts researchers conducted an experiment with adolescent males who were of driving age and measured their risk-taking depending on whether a passenger ( a peer of the same age ) was in the car one side of the reward system is '' social pain '' , which refers to the emotional pain felt by individual due to group repudiation and is associated with heightened activity in the anterior insula and the posterior cingulate according to treynor ’ s original “ identity shift effect ” hypothesis , the peer pressure process works in the following way : one ’ s state of harmony is disrupted when faced with the threat of external conflict ( social rejection ) for failing to conform to a group standard thus , one conforms to the group standard , but as soon as one does , eliminating this external conflict , internal conflict is introduced ( because one has violated one ’ s own standards ) although the peer pressure process begins and ends with one in a ( conflict-less ) state of harmony , as a result of conflict and the conflict resolution process , one leaves with a new identity—a new set of internalized standards in some cases , people can feel pressure to make themselves available 24/7 or to be perfect as a result , the power and impact of digital peer pressure may vary throughout the world

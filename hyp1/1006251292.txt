imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc children are aware of their position in the social hierarchy from a young age : their instinct is to defer to adults ' judgements and majority opinions similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one before him or her , however , were a group of children working in conjunction with the researchers when asked in the presence of the other children , the last child 's response was often the same as his or her peers however , when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers ' pressure , illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions an insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers ' behavior through pressure hill child development laboratory in the university of kansas designed a program to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system the study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers , and looked at their responses to potential techniques the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience peer conformity in young people is most pronounced with respect to style , taste , appearance , ideology , and values '' peer pressure '' , in : anthony s peer pressure is commonly associated with episodes of adolescent risk taking because these activities commonly occur in the company of peers peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior , such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers , making them more susceptible to group pressures gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences : girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns also available as : caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring , and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure conversely , some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use of note , substance use was also predicted by peer pressure susceptibility such that greater susceptibility was predictive of greater alcohol and drug use substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence this suggests that social contexts do not play the significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance as it may for others and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure using the resistance to peer influence scale , sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-old parental social support , consistent discipline ) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances then you have the modeling which is being a “ copycat ” and following your friends then finally you have the social norms which are drinking substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure the known correlational relationship between substance use and relationships with others that use makes resistance skills a natural treatment target this type of training is meant to help individuals refuse participation with substance use while maintaining their membership in the peer group programs that targeted students in grades 8–9 reduced smoking , but not alcohol and other drug abuse , and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all in a non-substance context , however , research has showed that decision-making training can produce concrete gains in risk perception and decision-making ability among autistic children the students colloquially call others who choose abstinence as '' umqwayito '' , which means dried fruit/meat an important solution for these problems is communication with adults , which the study found to be extremely lacking within adolescent social groups defined three types of peer norms that led to a person 's participation in sexual intercourse : descriptive norms , injunctive norms , and outright peer pressure the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group additionally , studies have found a link between self-regulation and likeliness to engage in sexual behavior the more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up , the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts based on these findings , it may be a good idea to prevent these through either a decision-making program or by targeting adolescents ' ability to self-regulate against possible risks some research suggests social media has a greater influence on purchasing decisions for consumers in china than in other countries in the world so the peer pressure argument contradicts itself instead of the typical peer pressure associated with western high school students , the peer pressure within the rwandan genocide , where tutsi and hutu have inter-married , worked under coercion compared to a baseline rate of 29.7 % ( only the voting reminder ) , the treatment that utilized peer pressure increased the percentage of household voters by 8.1 % ( to 37.8 % ) , which exceeds the value of in-person canvassing and personalized phone calls this suggests that peer pressure '' shames '' individuals for making smaller donations

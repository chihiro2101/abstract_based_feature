imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc children are aware of their position in the social hierarchy from a young age : their instinct is to defer to adults ' judgements and majority opinions similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one however , when allowed to privately share their responses with a researcher the children proved much more resistant to their peers ' pressure , illustrating the importance of the physical presence of their peers in shaping their opinions an insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers ' behavior through pressure hill child development laboratory in the university of kansas designed a program to measure how children could ease disruptive behavior in their peers through a two-part system after describing a series of tasks to their classroom that included bathroom usage , cleaning up , and general classroom behavior , teachers and researchers would observe children 's performance on the tasks the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g sitting down on a mat for reading time ) , and if a student reached three points by the end of the day they would receive a prize the second part brought in peer interaction , where students who reached three points were appointed '' peer monitors '' whose role was to lead their small groups and assign points at the end of the day even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience children entering this period in life become aware for the first time of the other people around them and realize the importance of perception in their interactions peer conformity in young people is most pronounced with respect to style , taste , appearance , ideology , and values '' peer pressure '' , in : anthony s peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured by their peers toward positive behavior , such as volunteering for charity or excelling in academics even though socially accepted children often have the most opportunities and the most positive experiences , research shows that social acceptance ( being in the popular crowd ) may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior , depending on the norms in the group groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky , drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers , making them more susceptible to group pressures gender also has a clear effect on the amount of peer pressure an adolescent experiences : girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns additionally , girls and boys reported facing differing amounts of pressures in different areas of their lives , perhaps reflecting a different set of values and priorities for each gender also available as : caldwell and colleagues extended this work by finding that peer pressure was a factor leading to heightened risk in the context of social gatherings with little parental monitoring , and if the individual reported themselves as vulnerable to peer pressure conversely , some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use peer pressure produces a wide array of negative outcomes for example , greater depression symptomatology , decreasing popularity , more sexual behavior , and externalizing behavior were greater for more susceptible teens of note , substance use was also predicted by peer pressure susceptibility such that greater susceptibility was predictive of greater alcohol and drug use though the impact of peer influence in adolescence has been well established , it was unclear at what age this effect begins to diminish it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure this study also found that girls were generally more resistant to peer influence than boys , particularly at mid-adolescence ( i.e parental social support , consistent discipline ) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances it is believed that peer pressure of excessive drinking in college comes down to three factors ; being offered alcohol , modeling and social norms substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure the known correlational relationship between substance use and relationships with others that use makes resistance skills a natural treatment target this type of training is meant to help individuals refuse participation with substance use while maintaining their membership in the peer group programs that targeted students in grades 8â€“9 reduced smoking , but not alcohol and other drug abuse , and programs that targeted older children reported no effect at all when administered the training in several short sessions that taught the children how to recognize risk from peers and react accordingly , the children showed through post-training assessments that they were able to identify potential threats and sources of pressure from peers and deflect them far better than normal adolescents in a control group they found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure : condoms are derided , threats of ridicule for abstinence , and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol ( especially for males ) defined three types of peer norms that led to a person 's participation in sexual intercourse : descriptive norms , injunctive norms , and outright peer pressure the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior the review found that indirect norms ( descriptive and injunctive ) had a stronger effect on a person 's decision to engage in sexual behavior than direct peer pressure between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group the mpfc is active when determining '' socially tagged '' objects , which are objects that peers have expressed an opinion about ; the striatum is significant for determining the value of these '' socially tagged '' objects and rewards in general social media provides a massive new digital arena for peer pressure and influence as a result , the power and impact of digital peer pressure may vary throughout the world instead of the typical peer pressure associated with western high school students , the peer pressure within the rwandan genocide , where tutsi and hutu have inter-married , worked under coercion this suggests that peer pressure '' shames '' individuals for making smaller donations

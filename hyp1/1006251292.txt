imitation plays a large role in children 's lives ; in order to pick up skills and techniques that they use in their own life , children are always searching for behaviors and attitudes around them that they can co-opt in other words , children get influenced by people that are important in their lives such as friends , parents and even youtubers , celebrities , singers , dancers , etc similar to the asch conformity experiments , a study done on groups of preschool children showed that they were influenced by groups of their peers to change their opinion to a demonstrably wrong one the children reported their size judgements in turn , and the child being tested was asked last when asked in the presence of the other children , the last child 's response was often the same as his or her peers an insight is that children can monitor and intervene in their peers ' behavior through pressure after describing a series of tasks to their classroom that included bathroom usage , cleaning up , and general classroom behavior , teachers and researchers would observe children 's performance on the tasks the study focused on three children who were clearly identified as being more disruptive than their peers , and looked at their responses to potential techniques the system utilized was a two-part one : first , each student would be given points by their teachers for correctly completing tasks with little disruption ( e.g the second part brought in peer interaction , where students who reached three points were appointed '' peer monitors '' whose role was to lead their small groups and assign points at the end of the day even small children , then , are susceptible to pressure from their peers , and that pressure can be used to effect positive change in academic and social environments adolescence is the time when a person is most susceptible to peer pressure because peers become an important influence on behavior during adolescence , and peer pressure has been called a hallmark of adolescent experience children entering this period in life become aware for the first time of the other people around them and realize the importance of perception in their interactions groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky , drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers , making them more susceptible to group pressures for example , parental monitoring is negatively associated with substance use ; yet when there is little monitoring , adolescents are more likely to succumb to peer coercion during initiation to substance use , but not during the transition from experimental to regular use conversely , some research has observed that peer pressure can be a protective factor against substance use peer pressure produces a wide array of negative outcomes allen and colleagues showed that susceptibility to peer pressure in 13- and 14-year-olds was predictive of not only future response to peer pressure , but also a wider array of functioning for example , greater depression symptomatology , decreasing popularity , more sexual behavior , and externalizing behavior were greater for more susceptible teens of note , substance use was also predicted by peer pressure susceptibility such that greater susceptibility was predictive of greater alcohol and drug use substance use is likely not attributed to peer pressure alone evidence of genetic predispositions for substance use exists and some have begun to examine gene x environment interactions for peer influence this suggests that social contexts do not play the significant role in substance use initiation and maintenance as it may for others and that interventions for these individuals should be developed with genetics in mind as well it is accepted that such peer pressure to use alcohol or illicit substances is less likely to exist in elementary school and very young adolescents given the limited access and exposure using the resistance to peer influence scale , sumter and colleagues found that resistance to peer pressure grew as age increased in a large study of 10- to 18-year-old this study also found that girls were generally more resistant to peer influence than boys , particularly at mid-adolescence ( i.e parental social support , consistent discipline ) have been shown to be an important contributor to the ability to resist peer pressure to use substances it is believed that peer pressure of excessive drinking in college comes down to three factors ; being offered alcohol , modeling and social norms then you have the modeling which is being a “ copycat ” and following your friends then finally you have the social norms which are drinking substance use prevention and intervention programs have utilized multiple techniques in order to combat the impact of peer pressure one major technique is , naturally , peer influence resistance skills this type of training is meant to help individuals refuse participation with substance use while maintaining their membership in the peer group the literature regarding the efficacy of these approaches , however , is mixed a systematic review of intervention programs in schools conducted by onrust et al they found a number of unhealthy practices derived from peer pressure : condoms are derided , threats of ridicule for abstinence , and engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners as part of a status symbol ( especially for males ) literature reviews in this field have attempted to analyze the norms present in the interactions and decision making behind these behaviors defined three types of peer norms that led to a person 's participation in sexual intercourse : descriptive norms , injunctive norms , and outright peer pressure the last norm defined by the study is called '' peer pressure '' by the authors , and is used to describe direct encouragement or pressure by a person 's peers to engage in sexual behavior between the two indirect norms , descriptive norms had a stronger effect : people were likely to try what they thought their peers were engaging in rather than what they thought had approval in their peer group the more trouble a subject had with self-regulation and self-control growing up , the more they were likely to fall prey to peer pressure that would lead them to engage in risky sexual acts an experiment performed by mason et al following this socialization , the subjects estimated the number of dots seen on the screen while given information about what an in-group or out-group member chose over 3 billion social media users across the world are using a variety of platforms , in turn , the type , frequency , and scope of the resulting peer pressure fluctuates peer pressure can , of course , operate on isolated individuals , or small groups , but it depends upon the majority wanting to do it an experiment conducted by diane reyniers and richa bhalla measured the amount donated by a group of london school of economics students this suggests that peer pressure '' shames '' individuals for making smaller donations

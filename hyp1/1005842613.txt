'' pistols : an illustrated history of their impact '' by jeff kinard , published by abc-clio , 2004 throughout the 17th century , flintlock muskets were produced in a wide variety of models in 1717 , a flintlock musket for the french infantry was standardized this became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all french troops while it is more correctly called a french infantry musket or a french pattern musket , these muskets later became known as '' charleville muskets '' , after the armory in charleville-mézières , ardennes , france revolutionary war , when americans tended to refer to all of the musket models as charlevilles some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flintlock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville the charleville musket 's design was refined several times during its service life later models of charleville muskets remained in service until 1840 , when percussion cap systems made the flintlock mechanism obsolete the longer range and better accuracy of the rifle was also considered to be of little value on a battlefield that was quickly obscured by black powder smoke the charleville 's 0.69-inch ( 17.5 mm ) caliber barrel was slightly smaller than its main competitor , the 0.75-inch caliber brown bess produced by the british charleville muskets were not used in battle like a modern rifle this use as a pike dictated the charleville 's general length and weight the charleville 's barrel was held into place by three barrel bands this made the charleville sturdier than the british brown bess musket , which used pins to hold the barrel in place after numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century , the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the model 1717 the model 1728 replaced the pinned barrel with a barrel held in place by three barrel bands , which would become standard on all subsequent charleville muskets the trumpet shaped scouring stick of the model 1763 was also abandoned in favor of a scouring stick with a lighter button shaped end though usually considered to be a separate model , the model 1766 was often referred to as a '' light model 1763 '' musket , especially in revolutionary war invoices the design of the stock was again modified for the model 1777 , with a cheek rest cut into the inboard side of the butt the russian model 1808 musket was based heavily on the design of the model 1777 charleville charleville muskets were also copied by belgium , austria and prussia as the augustin 1842 musket and potzdam musket '' small arms '' , the encyclopedia american , 1920 the charleville 1766 heavily influenced the design of the model 1795 musket

'' pistols : an illustrated history of their impact '' by jeff kinard , published by abc-clio , 2004 throughout the 17th century , flintlock muskets were produced in a wide variety of models in 1717 , a flintlock musket for the french infantry was standardized this became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all french troops while it is more correctly called a french infantry musket or a french pattern musket , these muskets later became known as '' charleville muskets '' , after the armory in charleville-mézières , ardennes , france the standard french long gun was also produced at tulle , saint-étienne , maubeuge arsenal , and other sites while technically not the correct name for these muskets , the use of the name charleville dates back to the u.s revolutionary war , when americans tended to refer to all of the musket models as charlevilles some references only refer to model 1763 and later versions as charleville flintlock muskets , while other references refer to all models as the charleville the charleville musket 's design was refined several times during its service life like all smoothbore muskets , the charleville flintlock musket was only accurate to about against a column of men , or forty to fifty yards ( 37 to 46 m ) against a single mansized target the charleville 's 0.69-inch ( 17.5 mm ) caliber barrel was slightly smaller than its main competitor , the 0.75-inch caliber brown bess produced by the british instead , charleville muskets were fired in mass formations en masse a shorter weapon could not be used as a pike , and its weight was a balance between being heavy enough to be used as a pike or club , but light enough to be carried and used by line infantry the charleville 's barrel was held into place by three barrel bands this made the charleville sturdier than the british brown bess musket , which used pins to hold the barrel in place charleville muskets were muzzle-loaded and used a flintlock firing mechanism after numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century , the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the model 1717 the model 1728 replaced the pinned barrel with a barrel held in place by three barrel bands , which would become standard on all subsequent charleville muskets changes in the 1740s included the standardized use of a steel scouring stick in 1741 and , after 1746 , newly manufactured muskets had the pan/frizzen bridle removed though usually considered to be a separate model , the model 1766 was often referred to as a '' light model 1763 '' musket , especially in revolutionary war invoices the russian model 1808 musket was based heavily on the design of the model 1777 charleville charleville muskets were also copied by belgium , austria and prussia as the augustin 1842 musket and potzdam musket

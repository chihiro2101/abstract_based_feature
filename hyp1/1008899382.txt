around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s shortly thereafter , wells were drilled in tidal zones along the gulf coast of texas and louisiana the goose creek field near baytown , texas is one such example in the 1920s , drilling was done from concrete platforms in lake maracaibo , venezuela in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1946 , magnolia petroleum ( now exxonmobil ) drilled at a site off the coast , erecting a platform in of water off st in early 1947 , superior oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off vermilion parish , louisiana in 1954 , the first jackup rig was ordered by zapata oil blue water drilling company owned and operated the four-column submersible blue water rig no.1 in the gulf of mexico for shell oil company it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode as of june , 2010 , there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs ( jackups , semisubs , drillships , barges ) available for service in the competitive rig fleet larger lake- and sea-based offshore platforms and drilling rig for oil fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks these modus ( mobile offshore drilling units ) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth a drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling early versions were built on a modified tanker hull , but purpose-built designs are used today they can drill in water depths up to the main types of floating production systems are floating production storage and offloading mini tlps can also be used as utility , satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea offshore turkmenistan waters ( caspian sea ) and offshore new zealand ) to position the gbs during installation , the gbs may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge ( provided it is large enough to support the gbs ) using strand jacks spars are moored to the seabed like tlps , but whereas a tlp has vertical tension tethers , a spar has more conventional mooring lines it also has the ability , by adjusting the mooring line tensions ( using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines ) , to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location the world 's deepest platform as of 2011 was the perdido spar in the gulf of mexico , floating in 2,438 metres of water the petronius platform is a compliant tower in the gulf of mexico modeled after the hess baldpate platform , which stands above the ocean floor in the us gulf of mexico , as of september 2012 , 420 former oil platforms , about 10 percent of decommissioned platforms , have been converted to permanent reefs production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment , such as the troll a platform standing on a depth of 300 meters offshore manned facilities also present logistics and human resources challenges the increased use of subsea facilities helps achieve the objective of keeping more workers onshore the world 's deepest oil platform is the floating perdido , which is a spar platform in the gulf of mexico in a water depth of

around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st the wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the miami and erie canal around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s shortly thereafter , wells were drilled in tidal zones along the gulf coast of texas and louisiana in the 1920s , drilling was done from concrete platforms in lake maracaibo , venezuela the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1946 , magnolia petroleum ( now exxonmobil ) drilled at a site off the coast , erecting a platform in of water off st in early 1947 , superior oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off vermilion parish , louisiana kerr-mcgee the british maunsell forts constructed during world war ii are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms in 1954 , the first jackup rig was ordered by zapata oil when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built , until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the gulf of mexico , the first jackup rig began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international blue water drilling company owned and operated the four-column submersible blue water rig no.1 in the gulf of mexico for shell oil company as the pontoons were not sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of the rig and its consumables , it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode the first purpose-built drilling semi-submersible ocean driller was launched in 1963 the first offshore drillship was the cuss 1 developed for the mohole project to drill into the earth 's crust as of june , 2010 , there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs ( jackups , semisubs , drillships , barges ) available for service in the competitive rig fleet it is operated by royal dutch shell and was built at a cost of 3 & nbsp ; billion larger lake- and sea-based offshore platforms and drilling rig for oil semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks these modus ( mobile offshore drilling units ) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth they are designed to move from place to place , and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a rack and pinion gear system on each leg a drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling most drillships are outfitted with a dynamic positioning system to maintain position over the well steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea the spar has more inherent stability than a tlp since it has a large counterweight at the bottom and does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright it also has the ability , by adjusting the mooring line tensions ( using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines ) , to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location during normal operations , psvs ( platform supply vessels ) keep the platforms provisioned and supplied , and ahts vessels can also supply them , as well as tow them to location and serve as standby rescue and firefighting vessels love is funded mainly by government agencies , but also in small part by the california artificial reef enhancement program offshore oil production involves environmental risks , most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities , and from leaks and accidents on the platform much of the innovation in the offshore petroleum sector concerns overcoming these challenges , including the need to provide very large production facilities while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities the world 's deepest oil platform is the floating perdido , which is a spar platform in the gulf of mexico in a water depth of

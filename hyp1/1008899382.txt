around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s in the 1920s , drilling was done from concrete platforms in lake maracaibo , venezuela the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1937 , pure oil company ( now chevron corporation ) and its partner superior oil company ( now part of exxonmobil corporation ) used a fixed platform to develop a field in of water , one mile ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) offshore of calcasieu parish , louisiana in early 1947 , superior oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off vermilion parish , louisiana kerr-mcgee the british maunsell forts constructed during world war ii are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms the scorpion was put into operation in may 1956 off port aransas , texas when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built , until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the gulf of mexico , the first jackup rig began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international blue water drilling company owned and operated the four-column submersible blue water rig no.1 in the gulf of mexico for shell oil company it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode since then , many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet the first offshore drillship was the cuss 1 developed for the mohole project to drill into the earth 's crust as of june , 2010 , there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs ( jackups , semisubs , drillships , barges ) available for service in the competitive rig fleet one of the world 's deepest hubs is currently the perdido in the gulf of mexico , floating in 2,438 meters of water fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks they are generally anchored by combinations of chain , wire rope or polyester rope , or both , during drilling and/or production operations , though they can also be kept in place by the use of dynamic positioning jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks these modus ( mobile offshore drilling units ) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling some variants of these applications , called floating storage and offloading unit or fsu ( floating storage unit ) , are used exclusively for storage purposes , and host very little process equipment the '' conventional '' tlp is a 4-column design which looks similar to a semisubmersible mini tlps can also be used as utility , satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea offshore turkmenistan waters ( caspian sea ) and offshore new zealand ) it is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard , by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow , and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water spars are moored to the seabed like tlps , but whereas a tlp has vertical tension tethers , a spar has more conventional mooring lines these installations , sometimes called toadstools , are small platforms , consisting of little more than a well bay , helipad and emergency shelter these installations , also known as satellite platforms , are small unmanned platforms consisting of little more than a well bay and a small process plant they are designed to operate in conjunction with a static production platform which is connected to the platform by flow lines or by umbilical cable , or both offshore oil production involves environmental risks , most notably oil spills from oil tankers or pipelines transporting oil from the platform to onshore facilities , and from leaks and accidents on the platform while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities the world 's deepest oil platform is the floating perdido , which is a spar platform in the gulf of mexico in a water depth of

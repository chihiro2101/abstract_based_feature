around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s shortly thereafter , wells were drilled in tidal zones along the gulf coast of texas and louisiana in the 1920s , drilling was done from concrete platforms in lake maracaibo , venezuela the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1946 , magnolia petroleum ( now exxonmobil ) drilled at a site off the coast , erecting a platform in of water off st in early 1947 , superior oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off vermilion parish , louisiana when offshore drilling moved into deeper waters of up to , fixed platform rigs were built , until demands for drilling equipment was needed in the to depth of the gulf of mexico , the first jackup rig began appearing from specialized offshore drilling contractors such as forerunners of ensco international it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode since then , many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet the first offshore drillship was the cuss 1 developed for the mohole project to drill into the earth 's crust larger lake- and sea-based offshore platforms and drilling rig for oil these platforms are built on concrete or steel legs , or both , anchored directly onto the seabed , supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs , production facilities and crew quarters such platforms are , by virtue of their immobility , designed for very long term use ( for instance the hibernia platform ) various types of structure are used : steel jacket , concrete caisson , floating steel , and even floating concrete steel jackets are structural sections made of tubular steel members , and are usually piled into the seabed compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces , and are typically used in water depths ranging from semi-submersible platforms can be moved from place to place and can be ballasted up or down by altering the amount of flooding in buoyancy tanks jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks these modus ( mobile offshore drilling units ) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth a drillship is a maritime vessel that has been fitted with drilling apparatus the main types of floating production systems are floating production storage and offloading tlps are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure mini tlps can also be used as utility , satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries a gbs can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea offshore turkmenistan waters ( caspian sea ) and offshore new zealand ) the jacks shall be released gradually whilst the gbs is ballasted to ensure that the gbs does not sway too much from target location eni 's devil 's tower located in of water in the gulf of mexico , was the world 's deepest spar until 2010 the world 's deepest platform as of 2011 was the perdido spar in the gulf of mexico , floating in 2,438 metres of water when finished , it will be the largest floating offshore facility while a floating system may be lower cost in deeper waters than a fixed platform , the dynamic nature of the platforms introduces many challenges for the drilling and production facilities subsea facilities are also easier to expand , with new separators or different modules for different oil types , and are not limited by the fixed floor space of an above-water installation the world 's deepest oil platform is the floating perdido , which is a spar platform in the gulf of mexico in a water depth of

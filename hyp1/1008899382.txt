around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st the wide but shallow reservoir was built from 1837 to 1845 to provide water to the miami and erie canal around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s shortly thereafter , wells were drilled in tidal zones along the gulf coast of texas and louisiana in the 1920s , drilling was done from concrete platforms in lake maracaibo , venezuela the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan landfill was used to raise shallow portions of the caspian sea in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in 1946 , magnolia petroleum ( now exxonmobil ) drilled at a site off the coast , erecting a platform in of water off st in early 1947 , superior oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off vermilion parish , louisiana kerr-mcgee the british maunsell forts constructed during world war ii are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms the first semi-submersible resulted from an unexpected observation in 1961 blue water drilling company owned and operated the four-column submersible blue water rig no.1 in the gulf of mexico for shell oil company it is operated by royal dutch shell and was built at a cost of 3 & nbsp ; billion these platforms are built on concrete or steel legs , or both , anchored directly onto the seabed , supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs , production facilities and crew quarters such platforms are , by virtue of their immobility , designed for very long term use ( for instance the hibernia platform ) fixed platforms are economically feasible for installation in water depths up to about compliant towers are designed to sustain significant lateral deflections and forces , and are typically used in water depths ranging from semi-submersibles can be used in water depths from it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling they can drill in water depths up to these platforms are moored to a location for extended periods , and do not actually drill for oil or gas a gbs can either be steel or concrete and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed steel gbs are predominantly used when there is no or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform , for example in the caspian sea offshore turkmenistan waters ( caspian sea ) and offshore new zealand ) spars are moored to the seabed like tlps , but whereas a tlp has vertical tension tethers , a spar has more conventional mooring lines the world 's deepest platform as of 2011 was the perdido spar in the gulf of mexico , floating in 2,438 metres of water these installations , sometimes called toadstools , are small platforms , consisting of little more than a well bay , helipad and emergency shelter they are designed to operate in conjunction with a static production platform which is connected to the platform by flow lines or by umbilical cable , or both the petronius platform is a compliant tower in the gulf of mexico modeled after the hess baldpate platform , which stands above the ocean floor the hibernia platform in canada is the world 's largest ( in terms of weight ) offshore platform , located on the jeanne d'arc basin , in the atlantic ocean off the coast of newfoundland this gravity base structure ( gbs ) , which sits on the ocean floor , is high and has storage capacity for of crude oil in its high caisson gulf of mexico , oil and gas facilities emit approximately 500000 tons of methane each year , corresponding to a loss of produced gas of 2.9 percent an offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria , sleeping quarters , management and other support functions the world 's deepest oil platform is the floating perdido , which is a spar platform in the gulf of mexico in a water depth of

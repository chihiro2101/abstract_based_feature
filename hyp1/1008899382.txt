around 1891 , the first submerged oil wells were drilled from platforms built on piles in the fresh waters of the grand lake st around 1896 , the first submerged oil wells in salt water were drilled in the portion of the summerland field extending under the santa barbara channel in california other notable early submerged drilling activities occurred on the canadian side of lake erie since 1913 and caddo lake in louisiana in the 1910s shortly thereafter , wells were drilled in tidal zones along the gulf coast of texas and louisiana in the 1920s , drilling was done from concrete platforms in lake maracaibo , venezuela the oldest offshore well recorded in infield 's offshore database is the bibiheyb…ôt well which came on stream in 1923 in azerbaijan in the early 1930s , texaco developed the first mobile steel barges for drilling in the brackish coastal areas of the gulf in early 1947 , superior oil erected a drilling/production platform in of water some 18 miles off vermilion parish , louisiana in any case , that made kerr-mcgee 's well the first oil discovery drilled out of sight of land kerr-mcgee the british maunsell forts constructed during world war ii are considered the direct predecessors of modern offshore platforms in 1954 , the first jackup rig was ordered by zapata oil blue water drilling company owned and operated the four-column submersible blue water rig no.1 in the gulf of mexico for shell oil company it was noticed that the motions at this draught were very small , and blue water drilling and shell jointly decided to try operating the rig in its floating mode the concept of an anchored , stable floating deep-sea platform had been designed and tested back in the 1920s by edward robert armstrong for the purpose of operating aircraft with an invention known as the '' seadrome '' since then , many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet as of june , 2010 , there were over 620 mobile offshore drilling rigs ( jackups , semisubs , drillships , barges ) available for service in the competitive rig fleet one of the world 's deepest hubs is currently the perdido in the gulf of mexico , floating in 2,438 meters of water larger lake- and sea-based offshore platforms and drilling rig for oil these platforms are built on concrete or steel legs , or both , anchored directly onto the seabed , supporting the deck with space for drilling rigs , production facilities and crew quarters these platforms have hulls ( columns and pontoons ) of sufficient buoyancy to cause the structure to float , but of weight sufficient to keep the structure upright jack-up mobile drilling units ( or jack-ups ) , as the name suggests , are rigs that can be jacked up above the sea using legs that can be lowered , much like jacks these modus ( mobile offshore drilling units ) are typically used in water depths up to , although some designs can go to depth they are designed to move from place to place , and then anchor themselves by deploying their legs to the ocean bottom using a rack and pinion gear system on each leg it is most often used for exploratory drilling of new oil or gas wells in deep water but can also be used for scientific drilling early versions were built on a modified tanker hull , but purpose-built designs are used today the main types of floating production systems are floating production storage and offloading these platforms are moored to a location for extended periods , and do not actually drill for oil or gas tlps are floating platforms tethered to the seabed in a manner that eliminates most vertical movement of the structure proprietary versions include the seastar and moses mini tlps ; they are relatively low cost , used in water depths between mini tlps can also be used as utility , satellite or early production platforms for larger deepwater discoveries there are several steel gbs in the world today ( e.g it is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard , by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow , and self-installing by controlled ballasting of the compartments with sea water on july 6 , 1988 , 167 people died when occidental petroleum 's piper alpha offshore production platform , on the piper field in the uk sector of the north sea , exploded after a gas leak production and drilling facilities may be very large and a large investment , such as the troll a platform standing on a depth of 300 meters an offshore oil platform is a small community in itself with cafeteria , sleeping quarters , management and other support functions the world 's deepest oil platform is the floating perdido , which is a spar platform in the gulf of mexico in a water depth of

among the most common 3-dimensional shapes are polyhedra , which are shapes with flat faces ; ellipsoids , which are egg-shaped or sphere-shaped objects ; cylinders ; and cones if an object falls into one of these categories exactly or even approximately , we can use it to describe the shape of the object a geometric shape is the geometry information which remains when location , scale , orientation and reflection are removed from the description of a geometric object that is , the result of moving a shape around , enlarging it , rotating it , or reflecting it in a mirror is the same shape as the original , and not a distinct shape left there are several ways to compare the shapes of two objects : congruence : two objects are congruent if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of rotations , translations , and/or reflections similarity : two objects are similar if one can be transformed into the other by a uniform scaling , together with a sequence of rotations , translations , and/or reflections for instance , the letters '' b '' and '' d '' are a reflection of each other , and hence they are congruent and similar , but in some contexts they are not regarded as having the same shape sometimes , only the outline or external boundary of the object is considered to determine its shape procrustes analysis is used in many sciences to determine whether or not two objects have the same shape , or to measure the difference between two shapes simple shapes can often be classified into basic geometry objects such as a point , a line , a curve , a plane , a plane figure ( e.g in geometry , two subsets of a euclidean space have the same shape if one can be transformed to the other by a combination of translations , rotations ( together also called rigid transformations ) , and uniform scalings having the same shape is an equivalence relation , and accordingly a precise mathematical definition of the notion of shape can be given as being an equivalence class of subsets of a euclidean space having the same shape however , a mirror image could be called a different shape two congruent objects always have either the same shape or mirror image shapes , and have the same size thus , congruent objects are always geometrically similar , but similar objects may not be congruent , as they may have different size a described shape has external lines that you can see and make up the shape in particular , procrustes analysis is a technique used for comparing shapes of similar objects ( e.g

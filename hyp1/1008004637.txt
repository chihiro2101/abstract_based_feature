the first known greek writer to mention a sibyl is heraclitus , in the 5th century bc : the sibyl , with frenzied mouth uttering things not to be laughed at , unadorned and unperfumed , yet reaches to a thousand years with her voice by aid of the god walter burkert observes that '' frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks '' are recorded very much earlier in the near east , as in mari in the second millennium and in assyria in the first millennium '' 116 until the literary elaborations of roman writers , sibyls were not identified by a personal name , but by names that refer to the location of their temenos , or shrine in pausanias , description of greece , the first sibyl at delphi mentioned ( '' the former '' earlier ) was of great antiquity , and was thought , according to pausanias , to have been given the name '' sibyl '' by the libyans see pausanias , description of greece , x.12 edited with commentary and translated by sir james frazer , 1913 edition the second sibyl referred to by pausanias , and named '' herophile '' , seems to have been based ultimately in samos , but visited other shrines , at clarus , delos , and delphi and sang there , but that at the same time , delphi had its own sibyl james frazer writes , in his translation and commentary on pausanias , frazer quotes ernst maass , de sibyllarum indicibus ( berlin , 1879 ) that only two of the greek sibyls were historical : erythraean sibyl , who is thought to have lived in the 8th century bc , and samian sibyl who lived somewhat later he observes that the greeks at first seemed to have known only one sibyl , and instances heraclides ponticus heraclides ponticus , on oracles as the first ancient writer to distinguish several sibyls : heraclides names at least three sibyls , the phrygian , the erythraean , and the hellespontine james frazer , translation and commentary on pausanias , description of greece , v 12 , line 1 , '' herophile surnamed sibyl '' : prof potter writes , '' in the late fifth century bc it does appear that 'sibylla ' was the name given to a single inspired prophetess '' david stone potter , prophecy and history in the crisis of the roman empire : a historical commentary on the thirteenth sibylline oracle , cf like heraclitus , plato speaks of only one sibyl , but in course of time the number increased to nine , with a tenth , the tiburtine sibyl , probably etruscan in origin , added by the romans the persian sibyl was said to be a prophetic priestess presiding over the apollonian oracle ; though her location remained vague enough so that she might be called the '' babylonian sibyl '' , the persian sibyl is said to have foretold the exploits of alexander the great pausanias , x.12 the medieval byzantine encyclopedia , the suda , credits the hebrew sibyl as author of the sibylline oracles the so-called libyan sibyl was identified with prophetic priestess presiding over the ancient zeus-amun ( zeus represented with the horns of amon ) oracle at the siwa oasis in the western desert of egypt the delphic sibyl was a mythical woman from before the trojan wars ( c 11th century bc ) mentioned by pausanias pausanias 10.12.1 writing in the 2nd century ad about stories he had heard locally the sibyl would have predated the real pythia , the oracle and priestess of apollo , originating from around the 8th century bc '' they may learn about the mysterious delphic sibyl , a mythical prophetess unrelated to the traditions of the oracle itself the sibyl 's son evander founded in rome the shrine of pan which is called the lupercal apollodorus of erythrae affirms the erythraean sibyl to have been his own countrywoman and to have predicted the trojan war and prophesied to the greeks who were moving against troy both that troy would be destroyed and that homer would write falsehoods the word acrostic was first applied to the prophecies of the erythraean sibyl , which were written on leaves and arranged so that the initial letters of the leaves always formed a word the hellespontian sibyl was born in the village of marpessus near the small town of gergitha , during the lifetimes of solon and cyrus the great the sibylline books at gergis was attributed to the hellespontine sibyl and was preserved in the temple of apollo at gergis the phrygian sibyl is most well known for being conflated with cassandra , priam daughter in homer 's iliad the phrygian sibyl appears to be a doublet of the hellespontine sibyl whether the sibyl in question was the etruscan sibyl of tibur or the greek sibyl of cumae is not always clear

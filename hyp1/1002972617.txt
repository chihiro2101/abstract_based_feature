many moves in the 1970s on 9 november 1977 , he startled the world by announcing his intention to go to jerusalem and speak before the knesset shortly afterward , the israeli government cordially invited him to address the knesset in a message passed to sadat via the us ambassador to egypt ten days after his speech , sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit , which launched the first peace process between israel and an arab state considered as a man with strong political convictions who kept his eye on the main objective , sadat had no ideological base , which made him politically inconsistent the sadat visit came about after he delivered a speech in egypt stating that he would travel anywhere , '' even jerusalem , '' to discuss peace '' menachem begin , guerrilla

the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace 228–229 the efforts initially focused on a comprehensive resolution of disputes between israel and the arab countries , gradually evolving into a search for a bilateral agreement between israel and egypt 229–228 '' upon assuming office on 20 january 1977 , president carter moved to rejuvenate the middle east peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential campaign in the united states the yom kippur war further complicated efforts to achieve the objectives written in united nations security council resolution 242 george lenczowski , american presidents and the middle east , duke university press , 1990 p.164 by the end of his first year in office , he had already met with anwar el sadat of egypt , king hussein of jordan , hafez al-assad of syria , and yitzhak rabin of israel hafez al-assad , who had no interest in negotiating peace with israel , the middle east : ten years after camp david , william b 9 also refused to come to the united states and only agreed to meet with carter in geneva sadat first spoke about the possibility of peace with israel in february 1971 and egypt was the initiator of many moves in the 1970s shortly afterward , the israeli government cordially invited him to address the knesset in a message passed to sadat via the us ambassador to egypt ten days after his speech , sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit , which launched the first peace process between israel and an arab state as would be the case with later israeli–arab peace initiatives , washington was taken by surprise ; the white house and state department were particularly concerned that sadat was merely reaching out to reacquire sinai as quickly as possible , putting aside the palestinian problem in sadat 's knesset speech he talked about his views on peace , the status of israeli occupied territories , and the palestinian refugee problem this tactic went against the intentions of both the west and the east , which were to revive the geneva conference prime minister begin 's response to sadat 's initiative , though not what sadat or carter had hoped , demonstrated a willingness to engage the egyptian leader it would afford israel the opportunity to negotiate only with egypt instead of with a larger arab delegation that might try to use its size to make unwelcome or unacceptable demands israel felt egypt could help protect israel from other arabs and eastern communists sadat 's visit was the first step to negotiations such as the preliminary cairo conference in december 1977 the egyptian president suggested to begin that israel place a secret representative in the american embassy in cairo with american '' cover , '' the true identity of the israeli , who would liaise between the egyptian and israeli leaders , would be known only to the american ambassador in cairo carter 's acceptance of the proposed liaison scheme would have signaled american backing for sadat 's unprecedented peace initiative an israeli-egyptian working summit was scheduled for 25 december in ismailiya , near the suez canal however , carter felt they were not '' aiming high enough '' and was interested in the establishment of a written '' land for peace '' agreement with israel returning the sinai peninsula and west bank numerous times both the egyptian and israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations , only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from carter the issues of israeli settlement withdrawal from the sinai and the status of the west bank created what seemed to be an impasse in response , carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the west bank to begin , while advocating sadat 's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the sinai peninsula partly due to carter 's determination in obtaining an israeli–egyptian agreement , a full two-week pledge to a singular international problem both of them had invested enormous amounts of political capital and time to reach an agreement the camp david accords comprise two separate agreements : '' a framework for peace in the middle east '' and '' a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel '' , the second leading towards the egypt–israel peace treaty signed in march 1979 '' the camp david accords . framework for peace in the middle east the first part of the framework was to establish an autonomous self-governing authority in the west bank and the gaza strip and to fully implement resolution 242 this was not the comprehensive peace that kissinger , ford , carter , or sadat had in mind during the previous american presidential transition it was less clear than the agreements concerning the sinai , and was later interpreted differently by israel , egypt , and the united states gold , 175 the second part of the framework dealt with egyptian–israeli relations , the real content worked out in the second egypt—israel framework the third part , '' associated principles , '' declared principles that should apply to relations between israel and all of its arab neighbors egypt , israel , jordan and the representatives of the palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the palestinian problem in all its aspects syria also informed egypt that it would not reconcile with the nation unless it abandoned the peace agreement with israel sela , '' arab–israel conflict '' , 100 according to kenneth stein in heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace : the accords were another interim agreement or step , but negotiations that flowed from the accords slowed for several reasons 1948 arab–israeli war 1956 suez war 1967 six-day war 1970 war of attrition 1973 yom kippur war arab–israeli conflict arab league and the arab–israeli conflict egypt–israel relations israeli–palestinian conflict palestinian autonomy talks proposals for a palestinian state adam curtis ' 2004 documentary the power of nightmares , in its second and third part , studies the camp david accords from the point of view of fundamentalist muslims text of the accords , israeli government text of accords and additional material , carter library israel 's self-rule plan

the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace 228–229 the efforts initially focused on a comprehensive resolution of disputes between israel and the arab countries , gradually evolving into a search for a bilateral agreement between israel and egypt 229–228 '' upon assuming office on 20 january 1977 , president carter moved to rejuvenate the middle east peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential campaign in the united states the yom kippur war further complicated efforts to achieve the objectives written in united nations security council resolution 242 israel 's prime minister yitzhak rabin and his successor , menachem begin , were both skeptical of an international conference by the end of his first year in office , he had already met with anwar el sadat of egypt , king hussein of jordan , hafez al-assad of syria , and yitzhak rabin of israel hafez al-assad , who had no interest in negotiating peace with israel , the middle east : ten years after camp david , william b on 9 november 1977 , he startled the world by announcing his intention to go to jerusalem and speak before the knesset ten days after his speech , sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit , which launched the first peace process between israel and an arab state as would be the case with later israeli–arab peace initiatives , washington was taken by surprise ; the white house and state department were particularly concerned that sadat was merely reaching out to reacquire sinai as quickly as possible , putting aside the palestinian problem considered as a man with strong political convictions who kept his eye on the main objective , sadat had no ideological base , which made him politically inconsistent the sadat visit came about after he delivered a speech in egypt stating that he would travel anywhere , '' even jerusalem , '' to discuss peace '' menachem begin , guerrilla leader who became peacemaker that speech led the begin government to declare that , if israel thought that sadat would accept an invitation , israel would invite him in sadat 's knesset speech he talked about his views on peace , the status of israeli occupied territories , and the palestinian refugee problem prime minister begin 's response to sadat 's initiative , though not what sadat or carter had hoped , demonstrated a willingness to engage the egyptian leader carter 's people apparently had no inkling of the secret talks in morocco between dayan and sadat 's representative , hassan tuhami , that paved the way for sadat 's initiative the basic message of sadat 's speech at the knesset were the request for the implementation of resolutions 242 and 338 sadat 's visit was the first step to negotiations such as the preliminary cairo conference in december 1977 a mechanism had yet to be created for israel and egypt to pursue the talks begun by sadat and begin in jerusalem the egyptian president suggested to begin that israel place a secret representative in the american embassy in cairo within days israeli journalists were allowed into cairo , breaking a symbolic barrier , and from there the peace process quickly gained momentum accompanied by their capable negotiating teams and with their respective interests in mind , both leaders converged on camp david for 13 days of tense and dramatic negotiations from 5 to 17 september 1978 carter 's advisers insisted on the establishment of an egyptian-israeli agreement which would lead to an eventual solution to the palestine issue however , carter felt they were not '' aiming high enough '' and was interested in the establishment of a written '' land for peace '' agreement with israel returning the sinai peninsula and west bank numerous times both the egyptian and israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations , only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from carter consequently , the 13 days marking the camp david accords were considered a success an eventual scrap of negotiations by either leader would have proven disastrous , resulting in taking the blame for the summit 's failure as well as a disassociation from the white house the camp david accords comprise two separate agreements : '' a framework for peace in the middle east '' and '' a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel '' , the second

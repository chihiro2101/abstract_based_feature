the camp david accords were the result of 14 months of diplomatic efforts by egypt , israel , and the united states that began after jimmy carter became president heroic diplomacy : sadat , kissinger , carter , begin , and the quest for arab–israeli peace 228–229 the efforts initially focused on a comprehensive resolution of disputes between israel and the arab countries , gradually evolving into a search for a bilateral agreement between israel and egypt 229–228 '' upon assuming office on 20 january 1977 , president carter moved to rejuvenate the middle east peace process that had stalled throughout the 1976 presidential campaign in the united states israel 's prime minister yitzhak rabin and his successor , menachem begin , were both skeptical of an international conference even earlier , begin had not been opposed to returning the sinai , but a major future obstacle was his firm refusal to consider relinquishing control over the west bank george lenczowski , american presidents and the middle east , duke university press , 1990 p.164 hafez al-assad , who had no interest in negotiating peace with israel , the middle east : ten years after camp david , william b sadat first spoke about the possibility of peace with israel in february 1971 and egypt was the initiator of many moves in the 1970s shortly afterward , the israeli government cordially invited him to address the knesset in a message passed to sadat via the us ambassador to egypt ten days after his speech , sadat arrived for the groundbreaking three-day visit , which launched the first peace process between israel and an arab state in sadat 's knesset speech he talked about his views on peace , the status of israeli occupied territories , and the palestinian refugee problem this tactic went against the intentions of both the west and the east , which were to revive the geneva conference the gesture stemmed from an eagerness to enlist the help of the nato countries in improving the ailing egyptian economy , a belief that egypt should begin to focus more on its own interests than on the interests of the arab world , and a hope that an agreement with israel would catalyze similar agreements between israel and her other arab neighbors and help solve the palestinian problem prime minister begin 's response to sadat 's initiative , though not what sadat or carter had hoped , demonstrated a willingness to engage the egyptian leader like sadat , begin also saw many reasons why bilateral talks would be in his country 's best interests it would afford israel the opportunity to negotiate only with egypt instead of with a larger arab delegation that might try to use its size to make unwelcome or unacceptable demands israel felt egypt could help protect israel from other arabs and eastern communists indeed , in a sense egypt and israel were ganging up to push carter off his geneva track with american '' cover , '' the true identity of the israeli , who would liaise between the egyptian and israeli leaders , would be known only to the american ambassador in cairo carter 's acceptance of the proposed liaison scheme would have signaled american backing for sadat 's unprecedented peace initiative numerous times both the egyptian and israeli leaders wanted to scrap negotiations , only to be lured back into the process by personal appeals from carter the issues of israeli settlement withdrawal from the sinai and the status of the west bank created what seemed to be an impasse in response , carter had the choice of trying to salvage the agreement by conceding the issue of the west bank to begin , while advocating sadat 's less controversial position on the removal of all settlements from the sinai peninsula during this time , carter even took the two leaders to the nearby gettysburg national military park in the hopes of using the american civil war as a simile to their own struggle partly due to carter 's determination in obtaining an israeli–egyptian agreement , a full two-week pledge to a singular international problem an eventual scrap of negotiations by either leader would have proven disastrous , resulting in taking the blame for the summit 's failure as well as a disassociation from the white house the camp david accords comprise two separate agreements : '' a framework for peace in the middle east '' and '' a framework for the conclusion of a peace treaty between egypt and israel '' , the second leading towards the egypt–israel peace treaty signed in march 1979 and israel and the u.s . framework for peace in the middle east the preamble of the '' framework for peace in the middle east '' starts with the basis of a peaceful settlement of the arab–israeli conflict : jimmy carter library , the framework for peace in the middle east , 17 september 1978 the framework itself consists of 3 parts the first part of the framework was to establish an autonomous self-governing authority in the west bank and the gaza strip and to fully implement resolution 242 begin insisted on the adjective '' full '' to ensure that it was the maximum political right attainable the withdrawal of israeli troops from the west bank and gaza was agreed to occur after an election of a self-governing authority to replace israel 's military government it was less clear than the agreements concerning the sinai , and was later interpreted differently by israel , egypt , and the united states egypt , israel , jordan and the representatives of the palestinian people should participate in negotiations on the resolution of the palestinian problem in all its aspects in order to provide full autonomy to the inhabitants , under these arrangements the israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants of these areas to replace the existing military government ) egypt , israel , and jordan will agree on the modalities for establishing elected self-governing authority in the west bank and gaza as soon as possible , but not later than the third year after the beginning of the transitional period , negotiations will take place to determine the final status of the west bank and gaza and its relationship with its neighbors and to conclude a peace treaty between israel and jordan by the end of the transitional period these negotiations will be conducted among egypt , israel , jordan and the elected representatives of the inhabitants of the west bank and gaza the camp david accords also prompted the disintegration of a united arab front in opposition to israel many of the arab nations blamed egypt for not putting enough pressure on israel to deal with the palestinian problem in a way that would be satisfactory to them text of the accords , israeli government text of accords and additional material , carter library israel 's self-rule plan

the history of level crossings depends on the location , but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would , on the approach of a train , wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks gated crossings became commonplace in many areas , as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock , and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman full , half or no barrier crossings superseded gated crossings , although crossings of older types can still be found in places in rural regions with sparse traffic , the least expensive type of level crossing to operate is one without flagmen or gates , with only a warning sign posted article 33 , 34 , 35 and 36 are specific to level crossings , because level crossings are recognized as dangerous with rare exceptions , trains do not stop at level crossings and rely on vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance in the 19th century and for much of the 20th , a written sign warning '' stop , look , and listen '' ( or similar wording ) was the sole protection at most level crossings where third rail systems have level crossings , there is a gap in the third rail over the level crossing , but this does not necessarily interrupt the power supply to trains since they may have current collectors on multiple cars the crossing lights may begin flashing and the gates lower immediately , or this might be delayed until after the traffic light turns red 28 % of railway fatalities are from level crossing related incidents a level crossing near gisborne , sees the palmerston north - gisborne line cross one of gisborne airport 's runways northern ireland : there was a runway crossing on the belfastâ€“derry railway line

the history of level crossings depends on the location , but often early level crossings had a flagman in a nearby booth who would , on the approach of a train , wave a red flag or lantern to stop all traffic and clear the tracks gated crossings became commonplace in many areas , as they protected the railway from people trespassing and livestock , and they protected the users of the crossing when closed by the signalman/gateman in rural regions with sparse traffic , the least expensive type of level crossing to operate is one without flagmen or gates , with only a warning sign posted article 33 , 34 , 35 and 36 are specific to level crossings , because level crossings are recognized as dangerous with rare exceptions , trains do not stop at level crossings and rely on vehicles and pedestrians to clear the tracks in advance on average , each year around 400 people in the european union and over 300 in the united states are killed in level crossing accidents as far as warning systems for road users are concerned , level crossings either have '' passive '' protection , in the form of various types of warning signs , or '' active '' protection , using automatic warning devices such as flashing lights , warning sounds , and barriers or gates in the 19th century and for much of the 20th , a written sign warning '' stop , look , and listen '' ( or similar wording ) was the sole protection at most level crossings today , active protection is widely available , and fewer collisions take place at level crossings with active warning systems in other areas , the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a flashing yellow for the duration of the train while the other directions face a flashing red light for the duration of the train railway safety in the european union , safety overview 2017 , sbn 978-92-9205-383-3 issn 2529-6302 doi:10.2821/813806 doi:10.2821/474487 tr-ag-17-101-en-c tr-ag-17-101-en-n 53 % of all those level crossings are active level where users are protected from or warned of the approaching train by devices activated when it is unsafe for the user to traverse the crossing aircraft landing on sealed 1310-metre runway 14l/32r are signalled with two red flashing lights on either side of the runway and a horizontal bar of flashing red lights to indicate the runway south of the railway line is closed , and may only land on the section of the runway north of the railway line

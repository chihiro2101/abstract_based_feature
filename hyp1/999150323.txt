thumb the hydrometer probably dates back to the greek philosopher archimedes ( 3rd century bc ) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids hypatia of alexandria ( 4th-5th century ad ) , an important female greek mathematician , is the first person traditionally associated with the hydrometer in a letter , synesius asks hypatia , his teacher , to make a hydrometer for him : the instrument in question is a cylindrical tube , which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size the hydrometer sinks deeper in low-density liquids such as kerosene , gasoline , and ethanol , and less deep in high-density liquids such as brine , milk , and acids it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use : a lactometer , for example , is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products an alcoholmeter is a hydrometer that indicates the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially a mixture of alcohol and water it is also known as a alcoholic proof ( after johann georg tralles , but commonly misspelled as traille and tralle ) if the milk sample is pure , the lactometer floats ; if it is adulterated or impure , the lactometer sinks a saccharometer is a hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution , invented by thomas thomson for measuring the density of petroleum products , such as fuel oils , the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature a battery hydrometer with thermometer ( thermohydrometer ) measures the temperature-compensated specific gravity and electrolyte temperature the degree of freeze protection can be related to the density ( and so concentration ) of the antifreeze ; different types of antifreeze have different relations between measured density and freezing point the hydrometer also determines the specific gravity ( or density ) of the suspension , and this enables the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated

thumb the hydrometer probably dates back to the greek philosopher archimedes ( 3rd century bc ) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids in a letter , synesius asks hypatia , his teacher , to make a hydrometer for him : the instrument in question is a cylindrical tube , which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size it has notches in a perpendicular line , by means of which we are able to test the weight of the waters it was rediscovered in 1612 by galileo and his circle of friends , and used in experiments especially at the accademia del cimento the use of the sikes device was made obligatory by british law in 1818 it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use : a lactometer , for example , is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products an alcoholmeter is a hydrometer that indicates the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially a mixture of alcohol and water it measures the density of the fluid certain assumptions are made to estimate the amount of alcohol present in the fluid a hydrometer calibrated to read specific gravity relative to water at is a standard tool for servicing car battery an acidometer ( sometimes spelled acidimeter ) is a hydrometer used to measure the specific gravity of an acid the hydrometer also determines the specific gravity ( or density ) of the suspension , and this enables the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated milk producer group resource book , food and agriculture organization of the united nations using your hydrometer , winemaking home page

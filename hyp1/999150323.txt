thumb the hydrometer probably dates back to the greek philosopher archimedes ( 3rd century bc ) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids hypatia of alexandria ( 4th-5th century ad ) , an important female greek mathematician , is the first person traditionally associated with the hydrometer whenever you place the tube in water , it remains erect according to the encyclopedia of the history of arabic science , it was used by abū rayhān al-bīrūnī in the 11th century and described by al-khazini in the 12th century it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom in many industries a set of hydrometers is used ( 1.0 & ndash ; 0.95 , 0.95 & ndash ; modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries examples include : api gravity , universally used worldwide by the petroleum industry specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use : a lactometer , for example , is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products the specific gravity of milk does not give a conclusive indication of its composition since milk contains a variety of substances that are either heavier or lighter than water , thomas thomson it is used primarily by winemakers and brewing , and it can also be used in making sorbets and ice-creams a battery hydrometer with thermometer ( thermohydrometer ) measures the temperature-compensated specific gravity and electrolyte temperature a salinometer is a hydrometer used to measure the salt content of the feed water to a marine steam boiler hydrometer analysis is performed if the grain sizes are too small for sieve analysis the hydrometer also determines the specific gravity ( or density ) of the suspension , and this enables the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated

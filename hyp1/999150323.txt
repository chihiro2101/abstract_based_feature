thumb the hydrometer probably dates back to the greek philosopher archimedes ( 3rd century bc ) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids hypatia of alexandria ( 4th-5th century ad ) , an important female greek mathematician , is the first person traditionally associated with the hydrometer in a letter , synesius asks hypatia , his teacher , to make a hydrometer for him : the instrument in question is a cylindrical tube , which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size the hydrometer sinks deeper in low-density liquids such as kerosene , gasoline , and ethanol , and less deep in high-density liquids such as brine , milk , and acids it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use : a lactometer , for example , is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products an alcoholmeter is a hydrometer that indicates the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially a mixture of alcohol and water it is also known as a alcoholic proof ( after johann georg tralles , but commonly misspelled as traille and tralle ) a saccharometer is a hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution , invented by thomas thomson , thomas thomson it is used primarily by winemakers and brewing , and it can also be used in making sorbets and ice-creams another automotive use of hydrometers is testing the quality of the antifreeze solution used for engine cooling an acidometer ( sometimes spelled acidimeter ) is a hydrometer used to measure the specific gravity of an acid the hydrometer also determines the specific gravity ( or density ) of the suspension , and this enables the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated hypatia of alexandria hydrometer information guide to brewing hydrometers jurjen draaijer

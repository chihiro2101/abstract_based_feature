thumb the hydrometer probably dates back to the greek philosopher archimedes ( 3rd century bc ) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids hypatia of alexandria ( 4th-5th century ad ) , an important female greek mathematician , is the first person traditionally associated with the hydrometer in a letter , synesius asks hypatia , his teacher , to make a hydrometer for him : the instrument in question is a cylindrical tube , which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size it has notches in a perpendicular line , by means of which we are able to test the weight of the waters the hydrometer sinks deeper in low-density liquids such as kerosene , gasoline , and ethanol , and less deep in high-density liquids such as brine , milk , and acids it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use : a lactometer , for example , is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products it measures the density of the fluid a higher '' potential alcohol '' reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity , assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars or carbohydrate based material the specific gravity of milk does not give a conclusive indication of its composition since milk contains a variety of substances that are either heavier or lighter than water a saccharometer is a hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution , invented by thomas thomson for measuring the density of petroleum products , such as fuel oils , the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature the degree of freeze protection can be related to the density ( and so concentration ) of the antifreeze ; different types of antifreeze have different relations between measured density and freezing point the basis for this test is stoke 's law for falling spheres in a viscous fluid in which the terminal velocity of fall depends on the grain diameter and the densities of the grain in suspension and of the fluid

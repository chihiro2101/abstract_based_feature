thumb the hydrometer probably dates back to the greek philosopher archimedes ( 3rd century bc ) who used its principles to find the density of various liquids hypatia of alexandria ( 4th-5th century ad ) , an important female greek mathematician , is the first person traditionally associated with the hydrometer in a letter , synesius asks hypatia , his teacher , to make a hydrometer for him : the instrument in question is a cylindrical tube , which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size it has notches in a perpendicular line , by means of which we are able to test the weight of the waters according to the encyclopedia of the history of arabic science , it was used by abū rayhān al-bīrūnī in the 11th century and described by al-khazini in the 12th century it is usual for hydrometers to be used with dense liquids to have the mark 1.000 ( for water ) near the top of the stem , and those for use with lighter liquids to have 1.000 near the bottom modern hydrometers usually measure specific gravity but different scales were ( and sometimes still are ) used in certain industries specialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use : a lactometer , for example , is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products it measures the density of the fluid alcoholometers have scales marked with volume percents of '' potential alcohol '' , based on a pre-calculated specific gravity , thomas thomson it is used primarily by winemakers and brewing , and it can also be used in making sorbets and ice-creams a hydrometer calibrated to read specific gravity relative to water at is a standard tool for servicing car battery a battery hydrometer with thermometer ( thermohydrometer ) measures the temperature-compensated specific gravity and electrolyte temperature an acidometer ( sometimes spelled acidimeter ) is a hydrometer used to measure the specific gravity of an acid the hydrometer also determines the specific gravity ( or density ) of the suspension , and this enables the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated

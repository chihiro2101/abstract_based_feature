radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator some clocks include indicators to alert users to possible inaccuracy when synchronization has not been recently successful ; teletext ( ttx ) : digital text pages embedded in television video also provide accurate time many modern tv sets and vcrs with ttx decoders can obtain accurate time from teletext and set the internal clock ; digital terrestrial television : the dvb and atsc standards have 2 packet types that send time and date information to the receiver digital television systems can equal gps stratum 2 accuracy ( with short term clock discipline ) and stratum 1 ( with long term clock discipline ) provided the transmitter site ( or network ) supports that level of functionality ; l-band and vhf digital audio broadcasting : dab systems provide a time signal that has a precision equal to or better than digital radio mondiale but like fm rds do not indicate clock stratum dedicated timing receivers can serve as local time standards , with a precision better than 50 & nbsp ; ns the recent revival and enhancement of loran , a land-based radio navigation system , will provide another multiple source time distribution system although any satellite navigation receiver that is performing its primary navigational function must have an internal time reference accurate to a small fraction of a second , the displayed time is often not as precise as the internal clock casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america

radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations the stations vary in broadcast frequency , in geographic location , and in how the signal is modulated to identify the current time list of radio time signal stations bipm annual report on time activities â€“ ftp : //ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/scale/timesignals/timesignals.pdf time signals , retrieved 2018 july 31 a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator ; l-band and vhf digital audio broadcasting : dab systems provide a time signal that has a precision equal to or better than digital radio mondiale but like fm rds do not indicate clock stratum dab systems can equal gps stratum 2 accuracy ( short term clock discipline ) and stratum 1 ( long term clock discipline ) provided the transmitter site ( or network ) supports that level of functionality a radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy these gps clocks combine time estimates from multiple satellite atomic clocks with error estimates maintained by a network of ground stations casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america

radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations list of radio time signal stations their model gc-1000 '' most accurate clock '' received shortwave time signals from radio station wwv in fort collins , colorado this oscillator was disciplined , meaning that the microprocessor-based clock used the highly accurate time signal received from wwv to trim the crystal oscillator radio controlled clock Â£19.95 clocks may have other features such as indoor thermometers and weather station functionality depending upon signal strength they may require placement in a location with a relatively unobstructed path to the transmitter and need fair to good atmospheric conditions to successfully update the time attached time signal systems generally use audible tones or phase modulation of the carrier wave 100506 digitalspy.co.uk many digital radio and digital television schemes also include provisions for time-code transmission digital television systems can equal gps stratum 2 accuracy ( with short term clock discipline ) and stratum 1 ( with long term clock discipline ) provided the transmitter site ( or network ) supports that level of functionality ; vhf fm radio data system : rds can send a clock signal with sub-second precision but with an accuracy no greater than 100 ms and with no indication of clock stratum a radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy many modern radio clocks use the global positioning system to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from terrestrial radio stations

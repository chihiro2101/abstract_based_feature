radio clocks synchronized to a terrestrial time signal can usually achieve an accuracy within a hundredth of a second relative to the time standard , generally limited by uncertainties and variability in radio propagation some timekeepers , particularly watches such as some casio wave ceptors which are more likely than desk clocks to be used when travelling , can synchronise to any one of several different time signals transmitted in different regions radio clocks depend on coded time signals from radio stations the stations vary in broadcast frequency , in geographic location , and in how the signal is modulated to identify the current time list of radio time signal stations descriptions a current list of times signal stations is published by the bipm as an appendix to their annual report ; the appendix includes coordinates of transmitter sites , operating schedules for stations , and the uncertainty of the carrier frequency of transmitters bipm annual report on time activities 2010 , pages 85-93 , retrieved 2011 september 12 a number of manufacturers and retailers sell radio clocks that receive coded time signals from a radio station , which , in turn , derives the time from a true atomic clock it automatically switched between wwv 's 5 , 10 , and 15 & nbsp ; mhz frequencies to find the strongest signal as conditions changed through the day and year radio controlled clock Â£19.95 clocks may have other features such as indoor thermometers and weather station functionality ; digital radio mondiale : drm is able to send a clock signal , but one not as precise as navigation satellite clock signals a radio clock receiver may combine multiple time sources to improve its accuracy once it has averaged its position , it can determine accurate time even if it can pick up signals from only one or two satellites casio wave ceptor clock network speaking clock time from npl time transfer time synchronization in north america

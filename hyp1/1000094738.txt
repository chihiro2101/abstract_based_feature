the game of liubo is also described in the mid 3rd century bce poem '' summons of the soul '' ( '' zhao hun '' 招魂 ) in the chu ci : then with bamboo dice and ivory pieces the game of liu bo is begun ; sides are taken ; they advance together ; keenly they threaten each other the game reached its greatest popularity during the han dynasty , as is evidenced by the discovery of many examples of liubo boards or sets of liubo game pieces as grave goods in high status tombs dating to the han dynasty after the end of the han dynasty the game seems to have lost its popularity , and there are no known examples of liubo funerary ware or depictions of liubo playing later than the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) although the game is still occasionally referred to in some historical sources and in poetry as late as the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ) , it seems that liubo had been largely displaced by the go ( game ) by the time of the yuan dynasty ( 1271–1368 ) all knowledge of the game of liubo had been lost , and it is only with the archeological discoveries of recent years that the game has become better known the old book of tang mentions that tibetans enjoyed playing both the game of go and liubo , but although ancient tibetan go boards have been discovered , no examples of tibetan liubo boards are known liubo boards and game equipment are often found as grave goods in tombs from the han dynasty in many tombs only the liubo board has survived ( especially if made of stone or bronze ) , and it can be assumed that any associated game pieces have decayed , whereas in other cases the game pieces ( which are often made of ivory ) have survived but the liubo board ( which is often made of wood or lacquer ) has rotted away long ) 象削一 1 eighteen-sided die with the numbers '' 1 '' through '' 16 '' and characters meaning '' win '' and '' lose '' not listed in the inventory the six black and six white game pieces are the main game pieces to be moved around the board , and similar sets of cubic or cuboid game pieces made from ivory , jadeite or rock crystal have been found in several other tombs the twelve long rods are two sets of the six throwing sticks that the players use to determine their moves , and which the game is named after ( liubo '' six sticks '' ) most han stone pictures of liubo show the players throwing sticks onto a mat between themselves ( with the liubo board to the side of the mat ) , and ceramic model liubo sets such as the one excavated in 1972 from lingbao in henan province show six sticks lined up neatly between the two players however , the twenty ivory game pieces and the eighteen-sided die in the mawangdui set are not typically associated with liubo boards in other tombs , and it is possible that they were not used for playing liubo , but were equipment for a different game no liubo board or liubo game pieces were found in the tomb , and because of the inscription '' take a drink '' ( 酒來 ) on one face of the die , the die and sets of tokens are supposed to have been used for a drinking game thumb the exact rules of the game of liubo are not known , and some of the surviving descriptions of the game are conflicting , which suggests that the game may have been played according to different rules at different times or in different places twelve game pieces are used , which according to the ancient rules are six white and six black most game historians think that liubo was a race game , and that players moved their six games pieces around the marks on the board some chinese game historians believe that xiangqi is not related to persian chess , but was based on liubo , whereas others have suggested that liubo was transmitted from china to india during the eastern jin ( 317–420 ) , where it developed into chaturanga , which was the ancestor to both persian chess and chinese chess the pattern found on the surface of liubo boards is also found on the most common type of han dynasty bronze mirror , known from their distinctive markings as tlv mirrors the liubo diagram is too small to have been used for playing liubo , and is covered with the sixty terms of the sexagenary cycle which are written all along the lines of the liubo diagram , in a similar way that the turtle diagram on the other side of the board is filled with the sixty terms the following is a list of famous people who are recorded to have played liubo : king mu of zhou ( reigned 977–922 bce ) , who according to the apocryphal travels of king mu once played a game of liubo with a hermit that lasted three days

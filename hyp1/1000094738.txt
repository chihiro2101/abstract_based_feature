it is not known when the game of liubo originated , although according to legend it was invented by wu cao ( 烏曹 , called wu zhou 烏胄 in the early 2nd century ce shuowen jiezi dictionary ) , a minister to king jie , the last king of the xia dynasty , who according to traditional chronology reigned 1728–1675 bce while there is no archeological or reliable documentary evidence to support the view that liubo dates back to the shang dynasty ( 1600–1046 bce ) , early chinese records do indicate that liubo was already a popular game by the warring states period ( 476–221 bce ) the game of liubo is also described in the mid 3rd century bce poem '' summons of the soul '' ( '' zhao hun '' 招魂 ) in the chu ci : then with bamboo dice and ivory pieces the game of liu bo is begun ; sides are taken ; they advance together ; keenly they threaten each other the game reached its greatest popularity during the han dynasty , as is evidenced by the discovery of many examples of liubo boards or sets of liubo game pieces as grave goods in high status tombs dating to the han dynasty pottery or wooden figurines of players with model liubo boards have also been discovered in some han tombs after the end of the han dynasty the game seems to have lost its popularity , and there are no known examples of liubo funerary ware or depictions of liubo playing later than the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) although the game is still occasionally referred to in some historical sources and in poetry as late as the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ) , it seems that liubo had been largely displaced by the go ( game ) by the time of the yuan dynasty ( 1271–1368 ) all knowledge of the game of liubo had been lost , and it is only with the archeological discoveries of recent years that the game has become better known the old book of tang mentions that tibetans enjoyed playing both the game of go and liubo , but although ancient tibetan go boards have been discovered , no examples of tibetan liubo boards are known liubo boards and game equipment are often found as grave goods in tombs from the han dynasty in many tombs only the liubo board has survived ( especially if made of stone or bronze ) , and it can be assumed that any associated game pieces have decayed , whereas in other cases the game pieces ( which are often made of ivory ) have survived but the liubo board ( which is often made of wood or lacquer ) has rotted away this liubo set comprises the following items ( the chinese description of the items in the inventory of grave goods that was found in the tomb are given in brackets ) : 1 lacquered wooden game box ( 45.0 × 45.0 × 17.0 & nbsp ; cm ) , six black and six white 象其十二 20 ivory game pieces ( 2.9 × 1.7 × 1.0 & nbsp ; cm the twelve long rods are two sets of the six throwing sticks that the players use to determine their moves , and which the game is named after ( liubo '' six sticks '' ) most han stone pictures of liubo show the players throwing sticks onto a mat between themselves ( with the liubo board to the side of the mat ) , and ceramic model liubo sets such as the one excavated in 1972 from lingbao in henan province show six sticks lined up neatly between the two players twelve game pieces are used , which according to the ancient rules are six white and six black most game historians think that liubo was a race game , and that players moved their six games pieces around the marks on the board although many persian game historians reject the claim that xiangqi or other chess variants derive from liubo , jean-louis cazaux argues that liubo could have been transformed from a race game to a battle game , and it could then have become chinese chess it has been theorized that the placement of the sixty sexagenary terms on the points of the liubo divination diagram indicate the possible positions for placing pieces when playing liubo , and that the sequence of the terms across the divination diagram reflects the path to be followed around the board when playing the game ( starting at the north-east corner and ending at the north side of the central square ) the following is a list of famous people who are recorded to have played liubo : king mu of zhou ( reigned 977–922 bce ) , who according to the apocryphal travels of king mu once played a game of liubo with a hermit that lasted three days

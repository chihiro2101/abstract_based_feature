it is not known when the game of liubo originated , although according to legend it was invented by wu cao ( 烏曹 , called wu zhou 烏胄 in the early 2nd century ce shuowen jiezi dictionary ) , a minister to king jie , the last king of the xia dynasty , who according to traditional chronology reigned 1728–1675 bce while there is no archeological or reliable documentary evidence to support the view that liubo dates back to the shang dynasty ( 1600–1046 bce ) , early chinese records do indicate that liubo was already a popular game by the warring states period ( 476–221 bce ) the game of liubo is also described in the mid 3rd century bce poem '' summons of the soul '' ( '' zhao hun '' 招魂 ) in the chu ci : then with bamboo dice and ivory pieces the game of liu bo is begun ; sides are taken ; they advance together ; keenly they threaten each other the earliest liubo boards to have been discovered are a pair of ornately decorated stone boards from a 4th-century bce tomb in the royal tomb complex of the zhongshan ( state ) at pingshan in hebei the game reached its greatest popularity during the han dynasty , as is evidenced by the discovery of many examples of liubo boards or sets of liubo game pieces as grave goods in high status tombs dating to the han dynasty some picture stones and engravings on stone coffins , especially those from the area of modern sichuan and yunnan provinces , show two winged immortals playing liubo on a mountain , usually as part of a larger scene depicting the queen mother of the west and various mythical animals after the end of the han dynasty the game seems to have lost its popularity , and there are no known examples of liubo funerary ware or depictions of liubo playing later than the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) by the time of the yuan dynasty ( 1271–1368 ) all knowledge of the game of liubo had been lost , and it is only with the archeological discoveries of recent years that the game has become better known the old book of tang mentions that tibetans enjoyed playing both the game of go and liubo , but although ancient tibetan go boards have been discovered , no examples of tibetan liubo boards are known liubo boards and game equipment are often found as grave goods in tombs from the han dynasty in many tombs only the liubo board has survived ( especially if made of stone or bronze ) , and it can be assumed that any associated game pieces have decayed , whereas in other cases the game pieces ( which are often made of ivory ) have survived but the liubo board ( which is often made of wood or lacquer ) has rotted away this liubo set comprises the following items ( the chinese description of the items in the inventory of grave goods that was found in the tomb are given in brackets ) : 1 lacquered wooden game box ( 45.0 × 45.0 × 17.0 & nbsp ; cm most han stone pictures of liubo show the players throwing sticks onto a mat between themselves ( with the liubo board to the side of the mat ) , and ceramic model liubo sets such as the one excavated in 1972 from lingbao in henan province show six sticks lined up neatly between the two players however , the twenty ivory game pieces and the eighteen-sided die in the mawangdui set are not typically associated with liubo boards in other tombs , and it is possible that they were not used for playing liubo , but were equipment for a different game no liubo board or liubo game pieces were found in the tomb , and because of the inscription '' take a drink '' ( 酒來 ) on one face of the die , the die and sets of tokens are supposed to have been used for a drinking game the most complete description of the rules of liubo occurs in a quotation from the lost book of ancient bo ( 古博經 ) in a commentary by zhang zhan ( 張湛 ) to the liezi that was written during the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) : method of play : two people sit facing each other over a board , and the board is divided into twelve paths , with two ends , and an area called the '' water '' in the middle most game historians think that liubo was a race game , and that players moved their six games pieces around the marks on the board although many persian game historians reject the claim that xiangqi or other chess variants derive from liubo , jean-louis cazaux argues that liubo could have been transformed from a race game to a battle game , and it could then have become chinese chess zhou zheng has pointed out that one tlv mirror dating to the reign of wang mang ( 9–23 ) has an inscription that includes the words '' carved with a liubo board pattern to dispel misfortune '' ( 刻具博局去祛不羊祥 ) , which suggests that the main purpose of the liubo pattern on mirrors was ritual , and that the pattern had a special significance beyond game-playing emperor jing of han ( reigned 156–141 bce ) , who when he was crown prince became angry during a game of liubo with the prince of wu , and threw the liubo board at the prince , killing him ( cf

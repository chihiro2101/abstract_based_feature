the thunderbirds squadron is a named usaf squadron , meaning it does not carry a numerical designation it is also one of the oldest squadrons in the air force , its origins dating to the organization of the 30th aero squadron , formed at kelly field , texas , on 13 june 1917 officers serve a two-year assignment with the squadron , while enlisted personnel serve three to four years as the squadron performs no more than 88 air demonstrations each year , replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year , in order to provide a constant mix of experience in addition to their air demonstration responsibilities , the thunderbirds are part of the usaf combat force and if required , can be rapidly integrated into an operational fighter unit since 15 february 1974 the thunderbirds have been a component of the 57th wing at nellis afb the thunderbirds perform aerial demonstrations in the f-16c fighting falcon , and they also fly two f-16d twin-seat trainers the f-16 has been the demonstration aircraft for the thunderbirds since the 1983 season partially as a result of that accident , the squadron switched to the f-16a , and sat out the 1982 airshow season and spent that year retraining and transitioning over to the new aircraft to ready themselves for the 1983 season beginning in june 1982 , the f-16 thunderbirds were led by major jim latham the team continues to fly the f-16 , having switched from the f-16a to the f-16c in 1992 all the modification work is performed at the maintenance depot at hill afb near ogden , utah other than those modifications , the aircraft are taken from the standard usaf inventory as production fighters , and can be returned to an operational squadron in short order without any major modification they also operated the two-seat f-16b during this time for training new pilots and for vip flights , these being replaced by the f-16d when the rest of the squadron transitioned to the f-16c ; lockheed martin f-16c/d fighting falcon ( block 32 ) : the block 32h/j aircraft currently assigned to the thunderbirds were built in 1986 and 1987 , and operated by the thunderbirds from 1992 to 2008 at their retirement , they were some of the oldest operational f-16s in the air force ; lockheed martin f-16c/d fighting falcon ( block 52 ) : in the 2009 show season the thunderbirds transitioned to an updated version of the f-16 fighter the block 52s have an upgraded avionics package that brings the thunderbird fleet into alignment with the rest of the worldwide f-16 fleet thanks to the 2009 upgrade to the block 52 , the diamond now has more than enough thrust to continue to climb straight up into their first maneuver , the diamond loop they perform formation loops and rolls or transitions from one formation to another the opposing solos usually perform their maneuvers just under the speed of sound , and show off the capabilities of their individual aircraft by doing maneuvers such as fast passes , slow passes , fast rolls , slow rolls , and very tight turns some of their maneuvers include both solo aircraft at once , such as opposing passes ( passing in close proximity to each other ) and mirror formations ( two aircraft being flown back-to-back in the calypso pass or belly-to-belly ) in fact , the number 5 on this aircraft is painted upside-down , and thus appears right-side-up for much of the routine at the end of the routine , all six aircraft join in formation , forming the delta on 19 september 1985 , the usaf air demonstration squadron was consolidated by air force historical research agency ( afhra ) with the 30th bombardment squadron , a unit which was organized on 13 june 1917 during its operational history , the 30th served in world war i as a training unit in france , its mission to train fighter pilots to go into combat on the western front the squadron was almost torpedoed on its troop ship crossing the atlantic ocean the next year the thunderbirds performed their first overseas air shows , in a tour of south and central america , and added a permanent solo routine to the demonstration they moved to the swept-wing f-84f thunderstreak aircraft , in which they performed 91 air shows , and received their first assigned support aircraft , a c-119 flying boxcar the thunderbirds ' aircraft were again changed in june 1956 , to the f-100 super sabre , which gave the team supersonic capability the year 1962 saw the introduction of dual solo routines , and the thunderbirds went on their first european deployment in 1963 , the year after the disbanding of the '' skyblazers '' ( see below ) the team switched to the f-105 thunderchief for the 1964 season , but were forced to re-equip with the f-100d after only six airshows due to a catastrophic structural failure of the no in 1969 , the squadron re-equipped with the front-line f-4e phantom , which it flew until 1973 , the only time the thunderbirds would fly jets similar to those of the blue angels as it was the standard fighter for both services in the 1960s and 1970s due to the 1973 oil crisis , the team flew only six air shows and was grounded for some time 4 slot plane , now regularly cleaned and shined like the others the team 's activities were suspended for six months pending investigation of the crashes and review of the program , then reinstituted using the general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon in 1983 , , and were upgraded to the f-16c ( now produced by lockheed martin ) in 1992 the united states postal service honored the air force 's 50th anniversary as a separate branch of the military in 1997 with a limited edition stamp featuring the thunderbirds left thumb in june 2005 , the thunderbirds selected major nicole malachowski for the no first woman thunderbird pilot proud to serve major nicole malachowski and major samantha weeks in 2008 , the thunderbirds remained in north america , performing both in the united states and in canada later in the year , the team returned to canada for two shows in abbotsford , british columbia sequestration measures cancel thunderbirds ' appearances past april 1 1 march 2013 usaf thunderbirds team members made recruiting appearances in the las vegas area that did not require travel ;

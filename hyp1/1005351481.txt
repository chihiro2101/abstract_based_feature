the thunderbirds squadron is a named usaf squadron , meaning it does not carry a numerical designation it is also one of the oldest squadrons in the air force , its origins dating to the organization of the 30th aero squadron , formed at kelly field , texas , on 13 june 1917 officers serve a two-year assignment with the squadron , while enlisted personnel serve three to four years as the squadron performs no more than 88 air demonstrations each year , replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year , in order to provide a constant mix of experience in addition to their air demonstration responsibilities , the thunderbirds are part of the usaf combat force and if required , can be rapidly integrated into an operational fighter unit since 15 february 1974 the thunderbirds have been a component of the 57th wing at nellis afb the thunderbirds perform aerial demonstrations in the f-16c fighting falcon , and they also fly two f-16d twin-seat trainers the f-16 has been the demonstration aircraft for the thunderbirds since the 1983 season in january 1982 , four members of the squadron were killed in what became known as the '' diamond crash '' of t-38 talon aircraft which the squadron had flown since 1974 partially as a result of that accident , the squadron switched to the f-16a , and sat out the 1982 airshow season and spent that year retraining and transitioning over to the new aircraft to ready themselves for the 1983 season the f-16 , however , had been considered for transition prior to the accident in rebuilding the thunderbird team , the air force recruited previous thunderbird pilots , qualified each in the f-16a , and had them begin by flying '' two-ship '' maneuvers , then expanded the program one airplane at a time up to the full six airplanes beginning in june 1982 , the f-16 thunderbirds were led by major jim latham all the modification work is performed at the maintenance depot at hill afb near ogden , utah ; general dynamics f-16a/b fighting falcon : during the switch to the f-16a the thunderbirds acquired new block 15 aircraft which they operated from 1983 to 1991 , making the team one of the last usaf units flying the older f-16a 's before transitioning into new c 's much of the thunderbirds ' display alternates between maneuvers performed by the diamond , and those performed by the solos the opposing solos usually perform their maneuvers just under the speed of sound , and show off the capabilities of their individual aircraft by doing maneuvers such as fast passes , slow passes , fast rolls , slow rolls , and very tight turns some of their maneuvers include both solo aircraft at once , such as opposing passes ( passing in close proximity to each other ) and mirror formations ( two aircraft being flown back-to-back in the calypso pass or belly-to-belly ) in mirror formations , one thunderbird must be inverted , and it is always number 5 there is also an extra amount of humor regarding the inverted performance of thunderbird 5 : the pilots all wear tailored flight suits with their name and jet number embroidered on the left breast the suit for the pilot of the number 5 airplane has the number sewn upside-down at the end of the routine , all six aircraft join in formation , forming the delta one of the thunderbirds ' standing engagements is the annual commencement ceremony at the united states air force academy in colorado springs on 19 september 1985 , the usaf air demonstration squadron was consolidated by air force historical research agency ( afhra ) with the 30th bombardment squadron , a unit which was organized on 13 june 1917 during its operational history , the 30th served in world war i as a training unit in france , its mission to train fighter pilots to go into combat on the western front it was awarded nine presidential unit citations in world war ii present-day usaf thunderbirds carry the lineage , history , and honors of the 30th on active duty the first team leader was major dick catledge ( 1953–1954 ) , and the first plane used by the unit was the straight-wing f-84 thunderjet edwin '' lucky '' palmgren , who also served a tour in 1963–1964 as team commander/leader . f-100 super sabre era it also signaled a shift in their performance routine—for example , the cuban eight opening routine was dropped , and emphasis was placed on low , screaming flyovers and demonstrations of takeoff performance the move to nellis also resulted in the first assignment of buildings and hangar space to the team this practice remained in force through the 1973 season in 1961 , the team was compelled to discontinue the vertical bank maneuver due to an faa regulation prohibiting aerobatics that pointed the nose of the aircraft toward the crowd 2 aircraft during a pitch-up maneuver that resulted in the death of capt gene devlin at hamilton air force base on 9 & nbsp ; may the f-100d super sabre was retained through the 1968 season by 1967 , the thunderbirds had flown 1,000 shows in 1969 , the squadron re-equipped with the front-line f-4e phantom , which it flew until 1973 , the only time the thunderbirds would fly jets similar to those of the blue angels as it was the standard fighter for both services in the 1960s and 1970s due to the 1973 oil crisis , the team flew only six air shows and was grounded for some time the cause of the crash was determined by the usaf to be the result of a mechanical problem with the no visually cueing off of the lead aircraft during formation maneuvering , the wing and slot pilots disregarded their positions relative to the ground the team 's activities were suspended for six months pending investigation of the crashes and review of the program , then reinstituted using the general dynamics f-16 fighting falcon in 1983 , , and were upgraded to the f-16c ( now produced by lockheed martin ) in 1992 in 1986 , the thunderbirds did a fly-by for the re-dedication of the statue of liberty in new york city they also performed the first american military demonstration in a communist country when the team visited beijing , china , in 1987 their 3,000th air show was performed in 1990 , and in 1991 the team went overseas to perform air shows in switzerland , poland , and hungary the united states postal service honored the air force 's 50th anniversary as a separate branch of the military in 1997 with a limited edition stamp featuring the thunderbirds that same year , the thunderbirds moved to nellis air force base , nevada , simplifying logistics and maintenance for the aircraft 20 august 2005 : the thunderbirds temporarily grounded themselves pending an investigation into a minor mid-air incident during the chicago air & water show 26 september 1957 : 1st lt bob rutte was killed in solo training at nellis smith , commander of the thunderbirds , was killed when his aircraft ingested seagulls while taking off from cleveland , ohio the '' skyblazers '' were the usaf demonstration team representing the united states air forces europe ( usafe ) from the late 1940s through the 1950s

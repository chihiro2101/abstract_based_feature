there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) the header 's rope is usually 30 to 32 feet in length and is a lot softer ( softer means the rope has more elasticity and flexibility ) the heeler 's rope is usually 35 or 36 feet in length and is a lot stiffer ( meaning it contains less flexibility and is more rigid to catch the feet ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute the header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches : a clean horn catch around both horns , a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn when he or she has a clear throw , the heeler throws a loop of rope under the running steer 's hind legs and catches them there is a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10-second penalty for breaking the barrier if both occur on the same run then the penalties are added together for a total of 15 seconds added heelers use a different technique , a right-handed heeler will twirl the loop on the left side of the rider 's body , always keeping the tip of the loop on the left side so that when the loop is thrown , it will go under the steer the lay of the loop is also very important ; it should stand up against the steer 's legs with the bottom loop on the ground so the steer will jump right into it

cowboys originally developed this technique on working ranches when it was necessary to capture and restrain a full-grown animal that was too large to handle by a single man there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) the header 's rope is usually 30 to 32 feet in length and is a lot softer ( softer means the rope has more elasticity and flexibility ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped western saddle - roping saddles have a particularly strong design with double rigging and other specialized features , including a rubber wrap around the saddle horn to keep the dally from slipping , and usually a wooden rawhide-covered saddle tree or a reinforced fiberglass tree the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute the header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches : a clean horn catch around both horns , a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn once the header has made the dally , the rider turns the horse , usually to the left , and the steer will follow , still running the header has three possible legal catches : both horns one horn and the nose ( half-head ) the neck any other head catch is considered illegal a modern rope is usually made of a blend of nylon and poly fibers , though some classic styles are still made of rawhide

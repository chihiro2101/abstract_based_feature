there is specialized equipment used by team ropers : rope - made of synthetic fibers , used to rope the steer , there are two kinds of ropes , one for the header ( the person who ropes the head ) and one for the heeler ( the person who ropes the legs ) horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped steers used for roping are moved from a holding corral through a series of narrow alleyways that lead to the roping arena the header is on one side ( usually the left , for a right-handed header ) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns , then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the '' heeler '' , who starts from the box on the other side of the chute a taut rope , called the barrier , runs in front of the header 's box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length , used to ensure that the steer gets a head start the header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches : a clean horn catch around both horns , a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn when he or she has a clear throw , the heeler throws a loop of rope under the running steer 's hind legs and catches them at higher levels , the header and the heeler are allowed only one throw each , if either misses , the team gets no score the header has three possible legal catches : both horns one horn and the nose ( half-head ) the neck any other head catch is considered illegal headers swing their loops overhead in a smooth , flat motion , aim for the back of the steer 's head and release the loop

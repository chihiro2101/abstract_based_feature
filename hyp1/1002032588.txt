physical training concentrates on mechanistic goals : training programs in this area develop specific motor skills , agility , strength or physical fitness , often with an intention of peaking at a particular time in military use , training means gaining the physical ability to perform and survive in combat , and learn the many skills needed in a time of war for psychological or physiological reasons , people who believe it may be beneficial to them can choose to practice relaxation training , or autogenic training , in an attempt to increase their ability to relax or deal with stress » relaxation training may cut hypertension medication among elderly - thaindian news while some studies have indicated relaxation training is useful for some medical conditions , autogenic training has limited results or has been the result of few studies job training - alaska department of worker and workforce development one can generally categorize such training as on-the-job or off-the-job the on-the-job training method takes place in a normal working situation , using the actual tools , equipment , documents or materials that trainees will use when fully trained examples of skills that commonly include simulator training during stages of development include piloting aircraft , spacecraft , locomotives , and ships , operating air traffic control airspace/sectors , power plant operations training , advanced military/defense system training , and advanced emergency response training off-the-job training method takes place away from normal work situations — implying that the employee does not count as a directly productive worker while such training takes place it often utilizes lectures , seminars , case studies , role playing , and simulation , having the advantage of allowing people to get away from work and concentrate more thoroughly on the training itself a more recent development in job training is the on the job training plan or ojt plan evolutionary algorithms , including genetic programming and other methods of machine learning , use a system of feedback based on '' fitness functions '' to allow computer programs to determine how well an entity performs a task , 1998 in robotics , such a system can continue to run in real-time after initial training , allowing robots to adapt to new situations and to changes in themselves , for example , due to wear or damage

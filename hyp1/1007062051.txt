up until world war ii , australia had been one of the world 's leading centres of aviation air transport was encouraged both with direct subsidies and with mail contracts immediately before the start of the war , more than half of all airline passenger and freight miles were subsidised however , after 1939 and especially after japan 's invasion of the islands to the north in 1941 , civil aviation was sacrificed to military needs the chifley government 's view was summed up by minister for air , arthur drakeford : where are the great pioneers of aviation ? air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in keeping with the labor government 's socialist leanings , the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier from this time on , it seemed , air transport in australia would be a government monopoly the government could set up an airline if it wished , but it could not legislate a monopoly much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network , seeing it as a form of socialisation by stealth with the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions , the australian national airways commission came into existence in february 1946 the asking price , the commission decided , was optimistic , and ansett declined a more modest counter offer one of the first people hired was lester brain , then the operations manager at qantas taa acquired its first two aircraft in mid-june 1946 , both douglas dc-3s a dozen more dc-3s would be added over the next few months , all ex-royal australian air force aircraft originally bought by the australian government under lend-lease his first task was to travel to the united states to accept delivery of the dc-4s taa planned to start regular services on 7 october , but there was a federal election set for 28 september it had a name , some excellent pilots , and some aircraft , but no ground facilities , no sales staff , no documentation , not even tickets with a great deal of effort , it should be possible to make the planned start date of 7 october taa 's first scheduled flight carried a full load of vips and just one paying passenger as post-war austerity gave way to a more affluent era , australians were able to travel by air in ever-increasing numbers much of the growth in domestic aviation in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s was dominated by the rivalry between the privately owned ansett-ana and the government-supported taa a major factor in the success of the government airline was the wise choice of aircraft after initially utilising the venerable and readily available douglas dc-3 , taa was able to acquire the revolutionary pressurised convair 240 the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time in 1986 , trans-australia airlines was rebranded as 'australian airlines ' and the kangaroo returned to its livery in 1986 , after a change of airline management , the name trans-australia airlines was controversially dropped , in favour of australian airlines qantas acquired australian airlines on 14 september 1992 , in preparation for its closure on 30 april 1994 qantas currently allocates space at its airport west training facility ( formerly the taa/australian airlines flight training centre ) for the taa museum on 21 september 1982 , trans australia airlines flight 454 , operated by a mcdonnell douglas dc-9 registered vh-tjs , was the subject of an attempted robbery of 600,000 from the reserve bank of australia

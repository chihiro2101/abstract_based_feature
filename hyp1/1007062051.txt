up until world war ii , australia had been one of the world 's leading centres of aviation governments on both sides of politics , well aware of the immense stretches of uninhabitable desert that separated the small productive regions of australia , regarded air transport as a matter of national importance ( as did the governments of other geographically large nations , such as the soviet union and the united states ) in the words of director general of civil aviation ab corbett , a nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation immediately before the start of the war , more than half of all airline passenger and freight miles were subsidised by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry from this time on , it seemed , air transport in australia would be a government monopoly he was ' a great believer in

the treasury released £350,000 to allow taa to order four larger , more modern douglas dc-4 ] s in the united states , and brain appointed aubrey koch ( from qantas ) as senior pilot dc4 skymaster and john watkins as chief technical officer it had a name , some excellent pilots , and some aircraft , but no ground facilities , no sales staff , no documentation , not even tickets the subsequent few years led to massive growth for the new airline a major factor in the success of the government airline was the wise choice of aircraft although government-owned , the menzies government ( 1949–66 ) of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned ansett and the requirements of taa suffered as a result the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time the conservative government 's benevolent attitude towards ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced taa to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop viscount aircraft with ansett-ana in return for slower and older , piston-engined douglas dc-6bs in another instance , taa had planned to re-equip with the revolutionary sud aviation caravelle pure-jet but as ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for their own needs , both airlines were required to purchase the ansett preference : the less advanced turbo-prop lockheed l-188 electra at this time the airline 's livery was the famous white t on a blue tail , referred to as the look of the '70s one of the more memorable television advertisements of the period was the jingle '' up , up and away , with taa , the friendly friendly way '' , whose lyrics and music were a variation on the 1967 song up , up and away , written by jimmy webb and also used by the us airline trans world airlines taa takes over australian transport april 1982 page 20 the two airlines policy was marginally relaxed in the early 1980s when taa was able to introduce the airbus a300 , whilst ansett chose to purchase the boeing 767 the a300 was a revolutionary aircraft at the time for the domestic airline industry ,

airlines ( taa ) and australian airlines insignia , and from 1985 to 1990 the seven network commentary team used the airline to travel between the states to attend the various racing venues in 1987 , the hawke government announced that the then government-owned domestic air terminals would be effectively privatised and leased to the two domestic airlines throughout this period of transformation and deregulation , australian airlines continued its successful run by posting healthy profits , increasing passenger loads and gained much favour from its catchy television commercials qantas then decided to merge the airline into its network ; subsequently the government offered the entire merged operation in a public float , after selling a cornerstone 25 % stake to british airways , thus returning qantas to the stock market after being absent from listing since 1947 over the years , the airline operated the following aircraft types : australian airlines also ordered the airbus a320

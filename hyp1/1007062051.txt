up until world war ii , australia had been one of the world 's leading centres of aviation in the words of director general of civil aviation ab corbett , a nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies the chifley government 's view was summed up by minister for air , arthur drakeford : where are the great pioneers of aviation ? air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry from this time on , it seemed , air transport in australia would be a government monopoly much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network , seeing it as a form of socialisation by stealth with the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions , the australian national airways commission came into existence in february 1946 the commission decided on the name '' trans-australia airlines '' , applied to the treasury for a preliminary advance of £10,000 and set about making plans , recruiting staff , and purchasing equipment the asking price , the commission decided , was optimistic , and ansett declined a more modest counter offer holyman was not willing to sell , nor to work for a government-owned body , but was interested in setting up a '' composite company '' , the details of which proposal remained unclear brain had 22 years of pioneering aviation experience behind him and was regarded as the man behind qantas ' reputation for technical excellence he applied for the advertised position of taa operations manager , but to his surprise and delight , was instead offered an appointment as general manager & nbsp ; — though at £3,000 pa , not the £10,000 that had been offered to holyman a dozen more dc-3s would be added over the next few months , all ex-royal australian air force aircraft originally bought by the australian government under lend-lease in july , the treasury released £350,000 to allow taa to order four larger , more modern douglas dc-4 ] s in the united states , and brain appointed aubrey koch ( from qantas ) as senior pilot dc4 skymaster and john watkins as chief technical officer he later wrote : : to my utter astonishment arthur coles , after the expected pep-talk about the dc-4 assignment , said he was relying on me to find out what new equipment was being developed that would enable us to offer our passengers a better product than our established rival , at a competitive price taa planned to start regular services on 7 october , but there was a federal election set for 28 september there was no certainty that the chifley government would not be treated likewise , and the opposition was opposed to government ownership it had a name , some excellent pilots , and some aircraft , but no ground facilities , no sales staff , no documentation , not even tickets with a great deal of effort , it should be possible to make the planned start date of 7 october taa 's first scheduled flight carried a full load of vips and just one paying passenger east-coast services were continually expanded and taa soon earned its title as a true 'trans australian ' airline with services to perth on the west coast of the continent , using douglas dc-4 aircraft although government-owned , the menzies government ( 1949–66 ) of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned ansett and the requirements of taa suffered as a result the controversial two airlines policy was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time australian 737 australian transport july 1986 page 23 australian airlines was the travel sponsor for the television shows neighbours , wheel of fortune and sale of the century between late 1987 and 1994 at sydney airport both major airlines had effectively been given freehold ownership of their two separate terminals in october 2002 , qantas revived the australian airlines brand as a full-service carrier , targeting the low-cost leisure market and flying primarily out of cairns and bali local time , a trans australia airlines douglas c-47 skytrain ( registered vh-tat ) crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from cambridge aerodrome for a cargo flight to melbourne , killing the two pilots

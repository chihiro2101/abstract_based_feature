up until world war ii , australia had been one of the world 's leading centres of aviation in the words of director general of civil aviation ab corbett , a nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation air transport , the government believed , was primarily a public service , like hospitals , the railways or the post office in keeping with the labor government 's socialist leanings , the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier from this time on , it seemed , air transport in australia would be a government monopoly the government could set up an airline if it wished , but it could not legislate a monopoly with the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions , the australian national airways commission came into existence in february 1946 he was ' a great believer in competition for business ' contested skies : trans-australian airlines , australian airlines , 1946–1992 , by john gunn , p 17 and would not have accepted the post of chairman of the anac had the monopoly provision been retained there was considerable correspondence between the commission and ivan holyman , the chairman of ana , with a view to recruiting holyman as general manager of taa at the princely salary of £10,000 pa , and , when that offer was declined , of buying the near-monopoly airline outright he applied for the advertised position of taa operations manager , but to his surprise and delight , was instead offered an appointment as general manager & nbsp ; — though at £3,000 pa , not the £10,000 that had been offered to holyman taa acquired its first two aircraft in mid-june 1946 , both douglas dc-3s in july , the treasury released £350,000 to allow taa to order four larger , more modern douglas dc-4 ] s in the united states , and brain appointed aubrey koch ( from qantas ) as senior pilot dc4 skymaster and john watkins as chief technical officer there was no certainty that the chifley government would not be treated likewise , and the opposition was opposed to government ownership it had a name , some excellent pilots , and some aircraft , but no ground facilities , no sales staff , no documentation , not even tickets much of the growth in domestic aviation in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s was dominated by the rivalry between the privately owned ansett-ana and the government-supported taa after initially utilising the venerable and readily available douglas dc-3 , taa was able to acquire the revolutionary pressurised convair 240 east-coast services were continually expanded and taa soon earned its title as a true 'trans australian ' airline with services to perth on the west coast of the continent , using douglas dc-4 aircraft although government-owned , the menzies government ( 1949–66 ) of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned ansett and the requirements of taa suffered as a result flight numbers and schedules were strictly controlled , and taa and ansett-ana invariably had flights departing airports for the same destination at exactly the same time with exactly the same equipment the policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft ( one from each airline ) were required on their delivery flights to enter australian airspace at exactly the same time the conservative government 's benevolent attitude towards ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced taa to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop viscount aircraft with ansett-ana in return for slower and older , piston-engined douglas dc-6bs nonetheless , the electra proved a reliable aircraft and taa continuously grew and prospered in the 1960s it introduced boeing 727-100 and mcdonnell douglas dc-9-30 whispering t-jets on primary routes as well as fokker f27 friendship jetliner turboprops on regional routes in 1986 , after a change of airline management , the name trans-australia airlines was controversially dropped , in favour of australian airlines associated with this image change was a new livery for the airlines ' aircraft , which wore the title australian qantas then decided to merge the airline into its network ; subsequently the government offered the entire merged operation in a public float , after selling a cornerstone 25 % stake to british airways , thus returning qantas to the stock market after being absent from listing since 1947 the majority of the australian airlines branding was removed during the merger and replaced with qantas branding ; for instance , australian 's flight deck lounge became the qantas club the sole remaining australian airlines brand identity – the australian way ( inflight ) magazine – was rebranded as the qantas magazine in 2016 on 19 july 1960 , flight 408 from sydney to brisbane , operated by a lockheed l-188 electra registered vh-tlb , was the subject of an attempted hijacking on 8 june 1979 , a hijacking attempt occurred on board a taa mcdonnell douglas dc-9 during a flight from coolangatta to brisbane

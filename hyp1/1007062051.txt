national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation by the end of the war , there were only nine domestic airlines remaining , eight smaller regional concerns and australian national airways ( ana ) , a conglomerate owned by british and australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85 % of all government air transport subsidies in august 1945 , only two days after the end of world war ii , the australian parliament passed the australian national airways bill , which set up the australian national airways commission ( anac ) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation 's air transport industry however , a legal challenge , backed by the liberal opposition and business interests generally , was successful and in december 1945 , the high court ruled that the commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies with the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions , the australian national airways commission came into existence in february 1946 the commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers , including the

1949–66 ) of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned ansett and the requirements of taa suffered as a result the controversial two airlines policy was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval the conservative government 's benevolent attitude towards ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced taa to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop viscount aircraft with ansett-ana in return for slower and older , piston-engined douglas dc-6bs nonetheless , the electra

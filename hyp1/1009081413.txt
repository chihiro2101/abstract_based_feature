paramecia were among the first ciliates to be seen by microscopy , in the late 17th century the earliest known illustration of a paramecium was published anonymously in philosophical transactions of the royal society , in 1703 in 1718 , the french mathematics teacher and microscopist louis joblot published a description and illustration of a microscopic ( fish ) , which he discovered in an infusion of oak bark in water joblot gave this creature the name , or '' slipper '' , and the phrase '' slipper animalcule '' remained in use as a colloquial epithet for paramecium , throughout the 18th and 19th centuries müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead between the alveolar sacs of the pellicle , most species of paramecium have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts , explosive organelles that discharge thin , non-toxic filaments , often used for defensive purposes paramecia live mainly by heterotrophy , feeding on bacteria and other small organisms the number of contractile vacuoles varies from one , to many , depending on species to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell some intracellular bacteria , known as kappa particles , give paramecia that have them the ability to kill other strains of paramecium that lack kappa the genome of the species paramecium tetraurelia has been sequenced , providing evidence for three whole-genome duplications however , a study published in 2006 seems to show that paramecium caudatum may be trained , through the application of a 6.5 volt electric current , to discriminate between brightness levels however , another study in 2017 suggested that the paramecia can only learn to associate the bright side of its swimming medium to electric current and not the dark side autogamy or conjugation can be induced by shortage of food at certain points in the paramecium life cycle in some species , such as the well studied paramecium tetraurelia , the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation other experiments by smith-sonneborn , holmes and holmes , and gilley and blackburn demonstrated that , during clonal aging , dna damage increases dramatically

the earliest known illustration of a paramecium was published anonymously in philosophical transactions of the royal society , in 1703 joblot gave this creature the name , or '' slipper '' , and the phrase '' slipper animalcule '' remained in use as a colloquial epithet for paramecium , throughout the 18th and 19th centuries the name '' paramecium '' – constructed from the greek ( paramēkēs , '' oblong '' ) – was coined in 1752 by the english microscopist john hill , who applied the name generally to '' animalcules which have no visible limbs or tails , and are of an irregularly oblong figure '' müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead this is lined with inconspicuous cilia which beat continuously , drawing food inside the cell a few species are mixotrophs , deriving some nutrients from endosymbiotic algae ( chlorella ) carried in the cytoplasm of the cell a paramecium propels itself by whiplash movements of the cilia , which are arranged in tightly spaced rows around the outside of the body '' artificial deciliation causes loss of calcium-dependent responses in paramecium '' ( 1976 ) : 170–172 to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell from there , food particles pass through a small opening called the cytostome , or cell mouth , and move into the interior of the cell as food enters the cell , it is gathered into food vacuoles , which are periodically closed off and released into the cytoplasm , where they begin cytoplasmic streaming when the vacuole , with its fully digested contents , reaches the anal pore , it ruptures , expelling its waste contents to the environment , outside the cell however , a study published in 2006 seems to show that paramecium caudatum may be trained , through the application of a 6.5 volt electric current , to discriminate between brightness levels like all ciliates , paramecium has a dual cell nucleus , consisting of a polyploid macronucleus , and one or more diploid micronuclei in some species , such as the well studied paramecium tetraurelia , the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation file : paramecium bursaria.ogv paramecium bursaria , a species with symbiotic algae file : paramecium putrinum.ogv paramecium putrinum file : paramecium dividing.ogv paramecium binary fission file : conjugation in paramecium.webm paramecium in conjugation file : инфузория туфелька 7.webm paramecium caudatum

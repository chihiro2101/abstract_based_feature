paramecia were among the first ciliates to be seen by microscopy , in the late 17th century the earliest known illustration of a paramecium was published anonymously in philosophical transactions of the royal society , in 1703 joblot gave this creature the name , or '' slipper '' , and the phrase '' slipper animalcule '' remained in use as a colloquial epithet for paramecium , throughout the 18th and 19th centuries müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead species of paramecium range in size from in length between the alveolar sacs of the pellicle , most species of paramecium have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts , explosive organelles that discharge thin , non-toxic filaments , often used for defensive purposes in all species , there is a deep oral groove running from the anterior of the cell to its midpoint a paramecium propels itself by whiplash movements of the cilia , which are arranged in tightly spaced rows around the outside of the body this low percentage is nevertheless close to the maximum theoretical efficiency that can be achieved by an organism equipped with cilia as short as those of the members of paramecium to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell as food enters the cell , it is gathered into food vacuoles , which are periodically closed off and released into the cytoplasm , where they begin cytoplasmic streaming some intracellular bacteria , known as kappa particles , give paramecia that have them the ability to kill other strains of paramecium that lack kappa the genome of the species paramecium tetraurelia has been sequenced , providing evidence for three whole-genome duplications like all ciliates , paramecium has a dual cell nucleus , consisting of a polyploid macronucleus , and one or more diploid micronuclei during conjugation , the micronuclei of each conjugant divide by meiosis and the haploid gametes pass from one cell to the other in some species , such as the well studied paramecium tetraurelia , the asexual line of clonally aging paramecia loses vitality and expires after about 200 fissions if the cells fail to undergo autogamy or conjugation

the earliest known illustration of a paramecium was published anonymously in philosophical transactions of the royal society , in 1703 joblot gave this creature the name , or '' slipper '' , and the phrase '' slipper animalcule '' remained in use as a colloquial epithet for paramecium , throughout the 18th and 19th centuries müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead species of paramecium range in size from in length in all species , there is a deep oral groove running from the anterior of the cell to its midpoint a paramecium propels itself by whiplash movements of the cilia , which are arranged in tightly spaced rows around the outside of the body '' artificial deciliation causes loss of calcium-dependent responses in paramecium '' ( 1976 ) : 170–172 this low percentage is nevertheless close to the maximum theoretical efficiency that can be achieved by an organism equipped with cilia as short as those of the members of paramecium to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell from there , food particles pass through a small opening called the cytostome , or cell mouth , and move into the interior of the cell when the vacuole , with its fully digested contents , reaches the anal pore , it ruptures , expelling its waste contents to the environment , outside the cell the genome of the species paramecium tetraurelia has been sequenced , providing evidence for three whole-genome duplications like all ciliates , paramecium has a dual cell nucleus , consisting of a polyploid macronucleus , and one or more diploid micronuclei during conjugation , the micronuclei of each conjugant divide by meiosis and the haploid gametes pass from one cell to the other autogamy or conjugation can be induced by shortage of food at certain points in the paramecium life cycle when macronuclei of clonally young paramecia were injected into paramecia of standard clonal age , the lifespan ( clonal fissions ) of the recipient was prolonged

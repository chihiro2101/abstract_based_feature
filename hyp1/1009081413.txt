paramecia were among the first ciliates to be seen by microscopy , in the late 17th century the earliest known illustration of a paramecium was published anonymously in philosophical transactions of the royal society , in 1703 müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead species of paramecium range in size from in length this is lined with inconspicuous cilia which beat continuously , drawing food inside the cell a few species are mixotrophs , deriving some nutrients from endosymbiotic algae ( chlorella ) carried in the cytoplasm of the cell the number of contractile vacuoles varies from one , to many , depending on species a paramecium propels itself by whiplash movements of the cilia , which are arranged in tightly spaced rows around the outside of the body it has been calculated that a paramecium expends more than half of its energy in propelling itself through the water to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell the food vacuoles are circulated by the streaming movement of the cell contents , a process called cyclosis or cytoplasmic streaming some intracellular bacteria , known as kappa particles , give paramecia that have them the ability to kill other strains of paramecium that lack kappa like all ciliates , paramecium has a dual cell nucleus , consisting of a polyploid macronucleus , and one or more diploid micronuclei during conjugation , the micronuclei of each conjugant divide by meiosis and the haploid gametes pass from one cell to the other autogamy or conjugation can be induced by shortage of food at certain points in the paramecium life cycle thus , dna damage in the macronucleus appears to be the cause of aging in p

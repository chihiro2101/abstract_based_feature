paramecia were among the first ciliates to be seen by microscopy , in the late 17th century the earliest known illustration of a paramecium was published anonymously in philosophical transactions of the royal society , in 1703 joblot gave this creature the name , or '' slipper '' , and the phrase '' slipper animalcule '' remained in use as a colloquial epithet for paramecium , throughout the 18th and 19th centuries the name '' paramecium '' – constructed from the greek ( paramēkēs , '' oblong '' ) – was coined in 1752 by the english microscopist john hill , who applied the name generally to '' animalcules which have no visible limbs or tails , and are of an irregularly oblong figure '' müller , the first researcher to place the genus within the linnaean system of taxonomy , adopted the name paramecium , but changed the spelling to paramœcium ehrenberg , in a major study of the infusoria published in 1838 , restored hill 's original spelling for the genus name , and most researchers have followed his lead species of paramecium range in size from in length the body of the cell is enclosed by a stiff but elastic structure called the pellicle between the alveolar sacs of the pellicle , most species of paramecium have closely spaced spindle-shaped trichocysts , explosive organelles that discharge thin , non-toxic filaments , often used for defensive purposes a few species are mixotrophs , deriving some nutrients from endosymbiotic algae ( chlorella ) carried in the cytoplasm of the cell osmoregulation is carried out by contractile vacuoles , which actively expel water from the cell to compensate for fluid absorbed by osmosis from its surroundings to gather food , the paramecium makes movements with cilia to sweep prey organisms , along with some water , through the oral groove ( vestibulum , or vestibule ) , and into the cell as a food vacuole moves along , enzymes from the cytoplasm enter it , to digest the contents paramecium bursaria and paramecium chlorelligerum harbour endosymbiotic green algae , from which they derive nutrients and a degree of protection from predators such as didinium nasutum like all ciliates , paramecium has a dual cell nucleus , consisting of a polyploid macronucleus , and one or more diploid micronuclei in the asexual fission phase of growth , during which cell divisions occur by mitosis rather than meiosis , clonal aging occurs leading to a gradual loss of vitality file : paramecium bursaria.ogv paramecium bursaria , a species with symbiotic algae file : paramecium putrinum.ogv paramecium putrinum file : paramecium dividing.ogv paramecium binary fission file : conjugation in paramecium.webm paramecium in conjugation file : инфузория туфелька 7.webm paramecium caudatum

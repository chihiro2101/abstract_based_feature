the artist antoine-jean gros called it '' a massacre of art '' a trip to england in 1825 included visits to thomas lawrence and richard parkes bonington , and the colour and handling of english painting provided impetus for his only full-length portrait , the elegant portrait of louis-auguste schwiter ( 1826–30 ) at roughly the same time , delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes , many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years by 1825 , he was producing lithographs illustrating shakespeare , and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from goethe 's faust paintings such as the combat of the giaour and hassan ( 1826 ) , and woman with parrot ( 1827 ) , introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent the death of sardanapalus depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants , concubines and animals the painting , which was not exhibited again for many years afterward , has been regarded by some critics as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole , thought of his figures and crowds as types , and dominated them by the symbolic figure of republican liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions although the french government bought the painting , by 1832 officials deemed its glorification of liberty too inflammatory and removed it from public view allard , sébastien , côme fabre , dominique de font-réaulx , michèle hannoosh , mehdi korchane , and asher ethan miller ( 2018 ) allard , sébastien , côme fabre , dominique de font-réaulx , michèle hannoosh , mehdi korchane , and asher ethan miller ( 2018 ) delacroix was entranced by the people and their clothes , and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings he believed that the north africans , in their attire and their attitudes , provided a visual equivalent to the people of classical rome and greece : the greeks and romans are here at my door , in the arabs who wrap themselves in a white blanket and look like cato or brutus while in tangier , delacroix made many sketches of the people and the city , subjects to which he would return until the end of his life animals—the embodiment of romantic passion—were incorporated into paintings such as arab horses fighting in a stable ( 1860 ) , the lion hunt ( of which there exist many versions , painted between 1856 and 1861 ) , and arab saddling his horse ( 1855 ) '' he had said , while working at saint sulpice , that the music put him in a state of '' exaltation '' which inspired his painting the three nude figures form an animated pyramid , bathed in a raking light which penetrates the grotto in which medea has hidden in that year he began work for the salon du roi in the chambre des députés , palais bourbon , which was not completed until 1837 , and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist madame cavé for the next ten years he painted in both the library at the palais bourbon and the library at the palais du luxembourg denis du saint sacrement with a large pietà , and from 1848 to 1850 he painted the ceiling in the galerie d'apollon of the louvre file : eugène ferdinand victor delacroix 024.jpg mademoiselle rose , 1817–1824 , louvre file : eugène delacroix - jeune orpheline au cimetière ( vers 1824 ) jpg ovid among the scythians , 1862 , version in metropolitan museum of art file : eugène delacroix , winter- juno and aeolus , oil sketch , 1856 jean louis marie eugène durieu , friend , colleague , and photographer list of orientalist artists orientalism musée national eugène delacroix , his last apartment in paris

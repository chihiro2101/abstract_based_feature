coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) the two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years , creating a complex network of interactions at least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects , because they involve communication between these organisms the yucca , yucca whipplei , is pollinated exclusively by tegeticula maculata , a yucca moth that depends on the yucca for survival the flowers have nectar suited to the birds ' diet , their color suits the birds ' vision and their shape fits that of the birds ' bills the floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time the fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter therefore , red pigments in the flowers of mimulus cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation following their respective breeding seasons , several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in north america , and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a particular way when probing the flower , especially when the bill and corolla are both curved most phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs , while the trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species such mutualism is not automatic : other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating , following different evolutionary strategy correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race the host reproduces sexually , producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite , which then evolves in response brood parasite demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite , for example in some cuckoos these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness their eggs are camouflaged as eggs of their hosts , implying that hosts can distinguish their own eggs from those of intruders and are in an evolutionary arms race with the cuckoo between camouflage and recognition the winged females act as parasites for the males of the other species as their sperm will only produce sterile hybrids the coevolution of the two mutually imposes selective pressures these often lead to an evolutionary arms race between prey and predator , resulting in anti-predator adaptations raven in 1964 proposed the theory of escape and radiate coevolution to describe the evolutionary diversification of plants and butterflies the types of coevolution listed so far have been described as if they operated pairwise ( also called specific coevolution ) , in which traits of one species have evolved in direct response to traits of a second species , and vice versa alternatively , an interaction between two or more species may be antagonistic in some environments but mutualistic ( beneficial to both or all species ) in other environments coevolution is primarily a biological concept , but has been applied to other fields by analogy in astronomy , an emerging theory proposes that black holes and galaxy develop in an interdependent way analogous to biological coevolution changes in hardware , an operating system or web browser may introduce new features that are then incorporated into the corresponding applications running alongside bakâ€“sneppen model coextinction ecological fitting escape and radiate coevolution genomics of domestication

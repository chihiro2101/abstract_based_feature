coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record , creating what charles darwin described as the '' abominable mystery '' of how they had evolved so quickly ; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) modern entomophily are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen a group of wasps sister to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants , as did the lepidoptera firstly , flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent ; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is , to approach it , and to identify where to land and finally to feed secondly , flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen , and colours such as blue and ultraviolet , to which their eyes are sensitive ; in contrast , bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange the pollen has evolved to become very sticky , and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower the yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs , deep within the flower away from potential predators hummingbirds and ornithophilous ( bird-pollinated ) flowers have evolved a mutualistic relationship the flowers have nectar suited to the birds ' diet , their color suits the birds ' vision and their shape fits that of the birds ' bills it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time the diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species , and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species can be attributed to the direction of the shift in pollinator preference the fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects in penstemon , flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers ' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird ' adaptations , but adaptation 'towards ' birds and 'away ' from bees can happen simultaneously however , some flowers such as heliconia angusta appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed : the species is occasionally ( 151 visits in 120 hours of observation ) visited by trigona stingless bees these bees are largely pollen robbers in this case , but may also serve as pollinators following their respective breeding seasons , several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in north america , and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats this allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird 's body , permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations the prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous ( insect-pollinated ) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers most phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs , while the trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species the genus ficus is composed of 800 species of vines , shrubs , and trees , including the cultivated fig , defined by their syconiums , the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness both intraspecific competition , with features such as sexual conflict and sexual selection , and interspecific competition , such as between predators , may be able to drive coevolution when detrimental , natural selection will favor evolutionary responses in the host population , resulting in a coevolutionary hotspot of ongoing reciprocal evolutionary changes in the parasite and host populations when the symbiont has no effect on the survival and reproduction of the host , natural selection on the symbiont population will not favor an evolutionary response by the host population ( i.e , a coevolutionary coldspot ) , the design and computational model of cooperative coevolution , phd thesis , george mason university , fairfax , virginia , 1997

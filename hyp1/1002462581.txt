coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record , creating what charles darwin described as the '' abominable mystery '' of how they had evolved so quickly ; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) modern entomophily are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen the two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years , creating a complex network of interactions either they evolved together , or at some later stages they came together , likely with pre-adaptations , and became mutually adapted a group of wasps sister to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants , as did the lepidoptera thirdly , flowers such as ophrys mimic females of particular insects , deceiving males into pseudocopulation the yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs , deep within the flower away from potential predators hummingbirds and ornithophilous ( bird-pollinated ) flowers have evolved a mutualistic relationship the floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species these flowers also tend to be more ornate , complex , and showy than their insect pollinated counterparts it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time the fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects in mimulus , an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds ; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination therefore , red pigments in the flowers of mimulus cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation in penstemon , flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers ' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird ' adaptations , but adaptation 'towards ' birds and 'away ' from bees can happen simultaneously these bees are largely pollen robbers in this case , but may also serve as pollinators tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill in a particular way when probing the flower , especially when the bill and corolla are both curved each of the two subfamilies of hummingbirds , the phaethornithinae ( hermits ) and the trochilinae , has evolved in conjunction with a particular set of flowers most phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs , while the trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species the genus ficus is composed of 800 species of vines , shrubs , and trees , including the cultivated fig , defined by their syconiums , the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside such mutualism is not automatic : other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating , following different evolutionary strategy hostâ€“parasite coevolution is the coevolution of a host and a parasite more generally , flowering plants are pollinated by insects from different families including bees , fly , and beetles , all of which form a broad guild of pollinators which respond to the nectar or pollen produced by flowers alternatively , an interaction between two or more species may be antagonistic in some environments but mutualistic ( beneficial to both or all species ) in other environments more formally , then , the geographic mosaic of coevolution can be viewed as a genotype by genotype by environment interaction ( gxgxe ) that results in the relentless evolution of interacting species coevolution is primarily a biological concept , but has been applied to other fields by analogy in his book the self-organizing universe , erich jantsch attributed the entire evolution of the cosmos to coevolution

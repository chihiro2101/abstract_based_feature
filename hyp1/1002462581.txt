coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record , creating what charles darwin described as the '' abominable mystery '' of how they had evolved so quickly ; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) modern entomophily are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen the two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years , creating a complex network of interactions a group of wasps sister to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants , as did the lepidoptera secondly , flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen , and colours such as blue and ultraviolet , to which their eyes are sensitive ; in contrast , bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange thirdly , flowers such as ophrys mimic females of particular insects , deceiving males into pseudocopulation the pollen has evolved to become very sticky , and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower the yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs , deep within the flower away from potential predators the flowers have nectar suited to the birds ' diet , their color suits the birds ' vision and their shape fits that of the birds ' bills the floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time the diversity in floral phenotype in ornithophilous species , and the relative consistency observed in bee-pollinated species can be attributed to the direction of the shift in pollinator preference the fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive therefore , red pigments in the flowers of mimulus cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation in penstemon , flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers ' evolutionary change than 'pro-bird ' adaptations , but adaptation 'towards ' birds and 'away ' from bees can happen simultaneously following their respective breeding seasons , several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in north america , and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology ornithophilous flowers need to be conspicuous to birds birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum , so red is particularly conspicuous to them most phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs , while the trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species a general characteristic of many viruses , as obligate parasites , is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness another evolutionary mode arises where evolution is still reciprocal , but is among a group of species rather than exactly two '' pairwise versus diffuse natural selection and the multiple herbivores of scarlet gilia , ipomopsis aggregata alternatively , an interaction between two or more species may be antagonistic in some environments but mutualistic ( beneficial to both or all species ) in other environments more formally , then , the geographic mosaic of coevolution can be viewed as a genotype by genotype by environment interaction ( gxgxe ) that results in the relentless evolution of interacting species the concept of coevolution was introduced in architecture by the danish architect-urbanist henrik valeur as an antithesis to the concept of '' star-architecture ''

coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record , creating what charles darwin described as the '' abominable mystery '' of how they had evolved so quickly ; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) modern entomophily are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen the two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years , creating a complex network of interactions a group of wasps sister to the bees evolved at the same time as flowering plants , as did the lepidoptera at least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects , because they involve communication between these organisms secondly , flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen , and colours such as blue and ultraviolet , to which their eyes are sensitive ; in contrast , bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange thirdly , flowers such as ophrys mimic females of particular insects , deceiving males into pseudocopulation the pollen has evolved to become very sticky , and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower the yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs , deep within the flower away from potential predators the blooming times of the flowers have also been found to coincide with hummingbirds ' breeding seasons the floral characteristics of ornithophilous plants vary greatly among each other compared to closely related insect-pollinated species it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum , so red is particularly conspicuous to them the genus ficus is composed of 800 species of vines , shrubs , and trees , including the cultivated fig , defined by their syconiums , the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the inside such mutualism is not automatic : other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating , following different evolutionary strategy host–parasite coevolution is the coevolution of a host and a parasite a general characteristic of many viruses , as obligate parasites , is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts brood parasite demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite , for example in some cuckoos antagonistic coevolution is seen in the harvester ant species pogonomyrmex barbatus and pogonomyrmex rugosus , in a relationship both parasitic and mutualistic while there is no genetic exchange between the species , they are unable to evolve in a direction where they become too genetically different as this would make crossbreeding impossible for instance , a trait in several species of flowering plant , such as offering its nectar at the end of a long tube , can coevolve with a trait in one or several species of pollinating insects , such as a long proboscis from these assumptions , geographic mosaic theory suggests that natural selection on interactions among species is driven by three sources of variation : 1 more formally , then , the geographic mosaic of coevolution can be viewed as a genotype by genotype by environment interaction ( gxgxe ) that results in the relentless evolution of interacting species in his book the self-organizing universe , erich jantsch attributed the entire evolution of the cosmos to coevolution bak–sneppen model coextinction ecological fitting escape and radiate coevolution genomics of domestication

coevolution is the evolution of two or more species which reciprocally affect each other , sometimes creating a mutualism ( biology ) between the species flowers appeared and diversified relatively suddenly in the fossil record , creating what charles darwin described as the '' abominable mystery '' of how they had evolved so quickly ; he considered whether coevolution could be the explanation he first mentioned coevolution as a possibility in on the origin of species , and developed the concept further in fertilisation of orchids ( 1862 ) modern entomophily are conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure pollination and in return to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen the two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years , creating a complex network of interactions the earliest bees , important pollinators today , appeared in the early cretaceous at least three aspects of flowers appear to have coevolved between flowering plants and insects , because they involve communication between these organisms firstly , flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent ; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is , to approach it , and to identify where to land and finally to feed hummingbirds and ornithophilous ( bird-pollinated ) flowers have evolved a mutualistic relationship it is generally agreed that plants formed coevolutionary relationships with insects first , and ornithophilous species diverged at a later time ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas with plants which flower in the winter bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects these bees are largely pollen robbers in this case , but may also serve as pollinators following their respective breeding seasons , several species of hummingbirds occur at the same locations in north america , and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology birds have their greatest spectral sensitivity and finest hue discrimination at the red end of the visual spectrum , so red is particularly conspicuous to them the prevalence of ultraviolet patterns and nectar guides in nectar-poor entomophilous ( insect-pollinated ) flowers warns the bird to avoid these flowers most phaethornithinae species are associated with large monocotyledonous herbs , while the trochilinae prefer dicotyledonous plant species each fig species has its own fig wasp which ( in most cases ) pollinates the fig , so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus such mutualism is not automatic : other ant species exploit trees without reciprocating , following different evolutionary strategy a general characteristic of many viruses , as obligate parasites , is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts whichever organism , host or parasite , that can not keep up with the other will be eliminated from their habitat , as the species with the higher average population fitness survives brood parasite demonstrates close coevolution of host and parasite , for example in some cuckoos these birds do not make their own nests , but lay their eggs in nests of other species , ejecting or killing the eggs and young of the host and thus having a strong negative impact on the host 's reproductive fitness antagonistic coevolution is seen in the harvester ant species pogonomyrmex barbatus and pogonomyrmex rugosus , in a relationship both parasitic and mutualistic the winged females act as parasites for the males of the other species as their sperm will only produce sterile hybrids the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution was developed by john n coevolutionary algorithms are used for generating artificial life as well as for optimization , game learning and machine learning in his book the self-organizing universe , erich jantsch attributed the entire evolution of the cosmos to coevolution bakâ€“sneppen model coextinction ecological fitting escape and radiate coevolution genomics of domestication

in the summer of 1792 charles dumouriez , the french foreign minister and commander of the armée du nord , had believed that the best way to prevent an austrian and prussian invasion of france was to invade the austrian netherlands , but the allies had launched their invasion before dumouriez was ready to move , and he had been forced to move south the allied invasion had been at valmy on 20 september where the french army stood up to an artillery bombardment , and proved that it would not flee at the first sign of opposition the allied commander , the duke of brunswick , was not willing to risk a full-scale assault on the french line , and withdrew after it this left dumouriez free to move north , to first raise the siege to lille in late september and into early october , and then to launch his long-planned invasion of the austrian netherlands the austrian army was commanded by duke albert of saxe-teschen , the governor of the austrian netherlands with this power , he tried to defend the long cuesmes ridge which ran from mons in the austrian left to jemappes on the right side the austrian right was commanded by franz freiherr von lilien , the center by franz sebastian de croix , count of clerfayt and the left by johann peter freiherr von beaulieu his own armée du nord contained 32,000 infantry , 3,800 cavalry and 100 guns and was supported in jemappes by a further 4,000 men and 15 guns under general françois harville the most obvious example was the commander of the french center , the duke of chartres , who had assumed the name of general egalite , and would later become king louis-philippe of france the right wing was commanded by general pierre de ruel , marquis de beurnonville and the left by general louis marie de la caussade ferrand who also carried the name jean henri becays ferrand dumouriez planned to use his army 's numbers to overtake the austrian position accordingly , he divided his army into two wings , giving general jean henri becays ferrand command of the left wing and general pierre de ruel , marquis de beurnonville control of the right wing in 1793 dumouriez was forced to flee into exile , but his victory at jemappes was an important step in the direction of the military triumphs of the french republic

cantilevers are widely found in construction , notably in cantilever bridges and balcony ( see corbel ) in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge a cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay in the southern united states , a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log cabin the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining the east stand at elland road stadium in leeds was , when completed , the largest cantilever stand in the world holding 17,000 spectators james 's park a redevelopment challenge the architects ' journal existing stadiums : st james ' park , newcastle image : forthbridgeedinburgh.jpg the forth bridge , a cantilever truss bridge in the cantilever wing one or more strong beams , called spars , run along the span of the wing the end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip to resist horizontal shear stresses from either drag or engine thrust , the wing must also form a stiff cantilever in the horizontal plane without cantilever transducers , atomic force microscopy would not be possible the first is stoney 's formula , which relates cantilever end deflection δ to applied stress σ : : \delta \frac surface stress on microcantilever , due to receptor-target binding , which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry a cantilever rack is a type of warehouse storage system consisting of the vertical column , the base , the arms , and the horizontal and/or cross-bracing

cantilevers are widely found in construction , notably in cantilever bridges and balcony ( see corbel ) in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge a cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support in an architectural application , frank lloyd wright 's fallingwater used cantilevers to project large balconies the roof built over the stands at old trafford uses a cantilever so that no supports will block views of the field the largest cantilevered roof in europe is located at st james ' park in newcastle-upon-tyne , the home stadium of newcastle united f.c 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base image : forthbridgeedinburgh.jpg the forth bridge , a cantilever truss bridge image : pierre pflimlin bridge uc adjusted.jpg this concrete bridge temporarily functions as a set of two balanced cantilevers during construction - with further cantilevers jutting out to support formwork to resist horizontal shear stresses from either drag or engine thrust , the wing must also form a stiff cantilever in the horizontal plane an early example of a mems cantilever is the resonistor , electromechanical monolithic resonator , us pat.3417249 - filed april 29 , 1966 r.j these superlinear dependences mean that cantilevers are quite sensitive to variation in process parameters , particularly the thickness as this is generally difficult to accurately measure surface stress on microcantilever , due to receptor-target binding , which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry

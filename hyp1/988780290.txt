in bridges , towers , and buildings cantilevers are widely found in construction , notably in cantilever bridges and balcony ( see corbel ) in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge in the southern united states , a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log cabin the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever this is very helpful when temporary supports , or falsework , can not be used to support the structure while it is being built ( e.g this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support the east stand at elland road stadium in leeds was , when completed , the largest cantilever stand in the world holding 17,000 spectators the largest cantilevered roof in europe is located at st james ' park in newcastle-upon-tyne , the home stadium of newcastle united f.c 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base image : forthbridgeedinburgh.jpg the forth bridge , a cantilever truss bridge the cantilever is commonly used in the wings of fixed-wing aircraft the result of this endeavor was the junkers j 1 pioneering all-metal monoplane of late 1915 , designed from the start with all-metal cantilever wing panels the first is stoney 's formula , which relates cantilever end deflection δ to applied stress σ : : \delta \frac a change in the force applied to a cantilever can shift the resonance frequency a cantilever rack is a type of warehouse storage system consisting of the vertical column , the base , the arms , and the horizontal and/or cross-bracing

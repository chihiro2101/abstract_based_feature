cantilevers are widely found in construction , notably in cantilever bridges and balcony ( see corbel ) in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge a cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever this is very helpful when temporary supports , or falsework , can not be used to support the structure while it is being built ( e.g nearly all cable-stayed bridges are built using cantilevers as this is one of their chief advantages this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support the roof built over the stands at old trafford uses a cantilever so that no supports will block views of the field 1 july 2005 less obvious examples of cantilevers are free-standing ( vertical ) radio towers without guy-wires , and chimneys , which resist being blown over by the wind through cantilever action at their base image : forthbridgeedinburgh.jpg the forth bridge , a cantilever truss bridge file : howrah bridge.jpg howrah bridge in india , a cantilever bridge while it is heavier , the cantilever avoids this issue and allows the plane to fly faster the end fixed rigidly to the central fuselage is known as the root and the far end as the tip the first is stoney 's formula , which relates cantilever end deflection δ to applied stress σ : : \delta \frac a chemical sensor can be obtained by coating a recognition receptor layer over the upper side of a microcantilever beam due to these properties , folding cantilever trays are often used in baggage and toolboxes

cantilevers are widely found in construction , notably in cantilever bridges and balcony ( see corbel ) in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge in the southern united states , a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log cabin temporary cantilevers are often used in construction the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever therefore , some truss arch bridges ( see navajo bridge ) are built from each side as cantilevers until the spans reach each other and are then jacked apart to stress them in compression before finally joining this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support in an architectural application , frank lloyd wright 's fallingwater used cantilevers to project large balconies the east stand at elland road stadium in leeds was , when completed , the largest cantilever stand in the world holding 17,000 spectators image : forthbridgeedinburgh.jpg the forth bridge , a cantilever truss bridge file : howrah bridge.jpg howrah bridge in india , a cantilever bridge the cantilever is commonly used in the wings of fixed-wing aircraft in the cantilever wing one or more strong beams , called spars , run along the span of the wing in flight , the wings generate vertical lift and the spars carry this load through to the fuselage cantilever wings require much stronger and heavier spars than would otherwise be needed in a wire-braced design mems cantilevers are also finding application as radio frequency filters and resonators

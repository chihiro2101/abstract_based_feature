cantilevers are widely found in construction , notably in cantilever bridges and balcony ( see corbel ) in cantilever bridges , the cantilevers are usually built as pairs , with each cantilever used to support one end of a central section the forth bridge in scotland is an example of a cantilever truss bridge a cantilever in a traditionally timber framed building is called a jetty or forebay in the southern united states , a historic barn type is the cantilever barn of log cabin the partially constructed structure creates a cantilever , but the completed structure does not act as a cantilever this type of construction lends itself well to balanced cantilever construction where the bridge is built in both directions from a single support the roof built over the stands at old trafford uses a cantilever so that no supports will block views of the field image : forthbridgeedinburgh.jpg the forth bridge , a cantilever truss bridge the cantilever is commonly used in the wings of fixed-wing aircraft while it is heavier , the cantilever avoids this issue and allows the plane to fly faster the result of this endeavor was the junkers j 1 pioneering all-metal monoplane of late 1915 , designed from the start with all-metal cantilever wing panels in the cantilever wing one or more strong beams , called spars , run along the span of the wing cantilever wings require much stronger and heavier spars than would otherwise be needed in a wire-braced design at speeds of around the drag of the bracing becomes excessive and the wing strong enough to be made a cantilever without excess weight penalty the first is stoney 's formula , which relates cantilever end deflection δ to applied stress σ : : \delta \frac surface stress on microcantilever , due to receptor-target binding , which produces cantilever deflection can be analyzed using optical methods like laser interferometry

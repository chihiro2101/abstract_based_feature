the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities during world war ii , a de havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the 'tsetse ' mosquito they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots tsetse pupae are under long within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies tsetse have large heads , distinctly separated eyes , and unusual antennae procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa targeting an entire tsetse population that is preferably genetic isolation while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease later , more targeted techniques used pour-on formulations in which advanced organic pesticides were applied directly to the backs of cattle the traps can kill by channeling the flies into a collection chamber or by exposing the flies to insecticide sprayed on the cloth tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently . resistance of tsetse flies to trypanosome infection he published : a naturalist on lake victoria , with an account of sleeping sickness and the tse-tse fly ; 1920

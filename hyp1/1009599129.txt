the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults tsetse first become separate from their mothers during the third larval instar , during which they have the typical appearance of maggots tsetse next develop a hard external case , the puparium , and become pupae & mdash ; small , hard-shelled , oblongs with two distinctive , small , dark lobes at the tail ( breathing ) end the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies the species trypanosoma brucei , which causes the disease , has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse the most notable is american trypanosomiasis , known as chagas disease , which occurs in south america , caused by trypanosoma cruzi , and transmitted by certain insects of the reduviidae , members of the hemiptera these diseases reduce the growth rate , milk productivity , and strength of farm animals , generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals the course of the disease in animals is similar to the course of sleeping sickness in humans other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa another tactic to manage the disease is to target the disease directly using surveillance and curative or prophylactic treatments to reduce the number of hosts that carry the disease economic analysis indicates that the cost of managing trypanosomosis through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered one early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies insecticide-based methods are normally very ineffective in removing the last remnants of tsetse populations , while , on the contrary , sterile males are very effective in finding and mating the last remaining females in the literature of environmental determinism , the tsetse has been linked to difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state other authors are more skeptical that the tsetse fly had such an immense influence on african development hale carpenter joined the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , and took the dm in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly ( glossina palpalis ) and sleeping sickness

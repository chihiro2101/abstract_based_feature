the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities during world war ii , a de havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the 'tsetse ' mosquito the biology of tsetse is relatively well understood by entomology they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults tsetse pupae are under long at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies tsetse have large heads , distinctly separated eyes , and unusual antennae other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts , which is only practical where large human populations are present also , the clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit right tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple , inexpensive traps tsetse are also attracted to large dark colors like the hides of cow and buffaloes the sustainable removal of the tsetse fly is in many cases the most cost-effective way of dealing with the t & t problem resulting in major economic benefits for subsistence farmers in rural areas the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals

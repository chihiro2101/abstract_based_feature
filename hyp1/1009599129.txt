the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults tsetse pupae are under long the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies the species trypanosoma brucei , which causes the disease , has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans this characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa human african trypanosomosis ( hat ) and animal african trypanosomosis ( aat ) are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m economic analysis indicates that the cost of managing trypanosomosis through the elimination of important populations of major tsetse vectors will be covered several times by the benefits of tsetse-free status area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered one early technique involved slaughtering all the wild animals tsetse fed on right tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple , inexpensive traps therefore , the integration of the sit as the last component of an area-wide integrated approach is essential in many situations to achieve complete eradication of the different tsetse populations , particularly in areas of more dense vegetation the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals . resistance of tsetse flies to trypanosome infection he published : a naturalist on lake victoria , with an account of sleeping sickness and the tse-tse fly ; 1920

the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities during world war ii , a de havilland antisubmarine aircraft was known as the 'tsetse ' mosquito they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage at the end of the pupal stage , tsetse emerge as adult flies the adults are relatively large flies , with lengths of , and have a recognizable shape or bauplan which makes them easy to distinguish from other flies tsetse have large heads , distinctly separated eyes , and unusual antennae strains that infected humans were divided into two subspecies based on their different virulences : trypanosoma brucei gambiense was thought to have a slower onset and trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense refers to strains with a more rapid , virulent onset other forms of human trypanosomiasis also exist but are not transmitted by tsetse animal trypanosomiasis , also called nagana when it occurs in cattle or horses or sura when it occurs in domestic pigs , is caused by several trypanosome species certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly the tsetse fly vector ranges mostly in the central part of africa trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa economic guidelines for strategic planning of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in west africa , by a.p.m many techniques have reduced tsetse populations , with earlier , crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper , more directed , and ecologically better while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease tsetse tend to rest on the trunks of trees so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies right tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple , inexpensive traps the use of chemicals as attractants to lure tsetse to the traps has been studied extensively in the late 20th century , but this has mostly been of interest to scientists rather than as an economically reasonable solution the authors also suggest that under a lower burden of tsetse , africa would have developed differently one conventional argument is that the tsetse fly made it difficult to use draught animals he published : a naturalist on lake victoria , with an account of sleeping sickness and the tse-tse fly ; 1920

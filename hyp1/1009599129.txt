the word tsetse means '' fly '' in tswana , a bantu language of southern africa recently , tsetse without the fly has become more common in english , particularly in the scientific and development communities they have been extensively studied because of their medical , veterinary , and economic importances , because the flies can be raised in a laboratory , and because they are relatively large , facilitating their analysis tsetse flies can be seen as independent individuals in three forms : as third-instar larvae , pupae and as adults within the puparial shell , tsetse complete the last two larval instars and the pupal stage four characteristics definitively separate adult tsetse from other kinds of flies : the infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into the central nervous system and invades the brain leading to extreme lethargy and eventually to death the species trypanosoma brucei , which causes the disease , has often been subdivided into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans the trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named trypanosoma brucei brucei a recent molecular study using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic , so the elucidation of the strains of t these diseases reduce the growth rate , milk productivity , and strength of farm animals , generally leading to the eventual death of the infected animals certain species of cattle are called trypanotolerant because they can survive and grow even when infected with trypanosomes although they also have lower productivity rates when infected trypanosoma congolense and trypanosoma vivax are the two most important species infecting bovine cattle in sub-saharan africa other forms of animal trypanosomiasis are also known from other areas of the globe , caused by different species of trypanosomes and transmitted without the intervention of the tsetse fly trypanosomiasis poses a considerable constraint on livestock agricultural development in tsetse fly infested areas of sub saharan africa , especially in west and central africa the conquest of sleeping sickness and nagana would be of immense benefit to rural development and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-saharan africa area-wide interventions against the tsetse and trypanosomosis problem appear more efficient and profitable if sufficiently large areas , with high numbers of cattle , can be covered vector control strategies can aim at either continuous pest control of target populations many techniques have reduced tsetse populations , with earlier , crude methods recently replaced by methods that are cheaper , more directed , and ecologically better while the fly eventually re-invaded in the 1950s , the new population of tsetse was free from the disease right tsetse populations can be monitored and effectively controlled using simple , inexpensive traps a project that was implemented from 1994 to 1997 on the island of unguja , zanzibar ( united republic of tanzania ) , demonstrated that , after suppression of the tsetse population with insecticides , sit completely removed the glossina austeni newstead population from the island after completion of the feasibility studies ( 2006â€“2010 ) , an area-wide integrated eradication campaign that included an sit component was started in 2011 , and by 2015 , the niayes region had become almost tsetse fly free although insecticides are being used for fly suppression , they are applied for short periods on traps , nets and livestock , and are not spread into the environment a '' tsetse suitability index '' was developed from insect population growth , climate and geospatial data to simulate the fly 's population steady state other authors are more skeptical that the tsetse fly had such an immense influence on african development

in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1879 , thomas edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing also , during this period , the japanese government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several japanese companies such as toray , nippon carbon , toho rayon and mitsubishi started their own development and production since the late 1970s , further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market , offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus intermediate carbon fibers , such as im 600 from toho rayon with up to 6,000 mpa were developed the atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite , consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern ( graphene sheets ) , the difference being in the way these sheets interlock depending upon the precursor to make the fiber , carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic , or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer precursors for carbon fibers are polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) , rayon and pitch the carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities , then wound on to bobbins making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres â€“ the first 5 naked years

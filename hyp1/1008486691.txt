in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1879 , thomas edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio those fibers were manufactured by heating strands of rayon until they carbonized this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w the carbon-fiber production plant was sold off to form bristol composite materials engineering ltd ( often referred to as bristol composites ) during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing intermediate carbon fibers , such as im 600 from toho rayon with up to 6,000 mpa were developed depending upon the precursor to make the fiber , carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic , or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber microelectrodes the result is usually 93–95 % carbon making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres – the first 5 naked years

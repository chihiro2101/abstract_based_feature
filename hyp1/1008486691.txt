in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing since the late 1970s , further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market , offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus intermediate carbon fibers , such as im 600 from toho rayon with up to 6,000 mpa were developed each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of 5–10 micrometres and consists almost exclusively of carbon the atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite , consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern ( graphene sheets ) , the difference being in the way these sheets interlock depending upon the precursor to make the fiber , carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic , or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile are turbostratic , whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding 2200 & nbsp ; °c carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber microelectrodes known for their conductivity , or lack thereof , carbon fibers can carry very low currents on their own making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres – the first 5 naked years

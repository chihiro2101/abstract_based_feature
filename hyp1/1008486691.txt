in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1879 , thomas edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w these fibers contained about 85 % carbon and had excellent flexural strength since the late 1970s , further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market , offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus jacob lahijani invented balanced ultra-high young 's modulus ( greater than 100 mpsi ) and high tensile strength pitch carbon fiber ( greater than 500 kpsi ) used extensively in automotive and aerospace applications carbon fiber is frequently supplied in the form of a continuous tow wound onto a reel the tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating , or size , such as polyethylene oxide ( peo ) or polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) the atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite , consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern ( graphene sheets ) , the difference being in the way these sheets interlock in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive reinforced carbon-carbon ( rcc ) consists of carbon fiber-reinforced graphite , and is used structurally in high-temperature applications making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres â€“ the first 5 naked years

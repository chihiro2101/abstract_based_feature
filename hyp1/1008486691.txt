in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio those fibers were manufactured by heating strands of rayon until they carbonized this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications the high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in 1963 in a process developed by w during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing these fibers contained about 85 % carbon and had excellent flexural strength jacob lahijani invented balanced ultra-high young 's modulus ( greater than 100 mpsi ) and high tensile strength pitch carbon fiber ( greater than 500 kpsi ) used extensively in automotive and aerospace applications the tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating , or size , such as polyethylene oxide ( peo ) or polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of 5–10 micrometres and consists almost exclusively of carbon turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength , whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high young 's modulus ( i.e in a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive industry , carbon fiber may be 10-12x more expensive the increasing use of carbon fiber composites is displacing aluminum from aerospace applications in favor of other metals because of galvanic corrosion issues the carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities , then wound on to bobbins the carbon can become further enhanced , as high modulus , or high strength carbon , by heat treatment processes making carbon fiber how carbon fiber is made [ carbon fibres – the first 5 naked years

in 1860 , joseph swan produced carbon fibers for the first time , for use in light bulbs in 1879 , thomas edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all-carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity in 1880 , lewis latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb , heated by electricity in 1958 , roger bacon created high-performance carbon fibers at the union carbide parma technical center located outside of cleveland , ohio this process proved to be inefficient , as the resulting fibers contained only about 20 % carbon and had low strength and stiffness properties akio shindo at agency of industrial science and technology of japan , using polyacrylonitrile ( pan ) as a raw material this had produced a carbon fiber that contained about 55 % carbon 3,294,489 ) for producing a high carbon content ( 99 % ) fiber using rayon as a precursor these carbon fibers had sufficient strength ( modulus of elasticity and tensile strength ) to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications during the 1960s , experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing also , during this period , the japanese government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several japanese companies such as toray , nippon carbon , toho rayon and mitsubishi started their own development and production the tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating , or size , such as polyethylene oxide ( peo ) or polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of 5–10 micrometres and consists almost exclusively of carbon in turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded , or crumpled , together carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile are turbostratic , whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding 2200 & nbsp ; °c the strongest demand for carbon fiber come from aircraft and aerospace , wind energy , as well as the automotive industry with optimized resin systems carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials , particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber reinforced polymer reinforced carbon-carbon ( rcc ) consists of carbon fiber-reinforced graphite , and is used structurally in high-temperature applications after drawing or spinning , the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms ( carbonization ) , producing the final carbon fiber

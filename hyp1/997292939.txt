way-points are sets of coordinates that identify a point in physical space today , these associations persist , but waypoints are more often associated with physical artifacts created specifically for navigation , such as radio beacons , buoys , satellites or control points in the modern world , waypoints are increasingly abstract , often having no obvious relationship to any distinctive features of the real world abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or utm coordinates plus the reference data , and often a name if they are marked on charts , and are located using a radio navigation system such as a vor or gps receiver a waypoint can be a destination , a fix along a planned course used to make a journey , or simply a point of reference useful for navigation gps systems are increasingly used to create and use waypoints in navigation of all kinds a typical gps receiver can locate a waypoint with an accuracy of three meters or better when used with land-based assisting technologies such as the wide area augmentation system ( waas ) for example , marine gps receivers often have a '' man overboard '' function , which instantly creates a waypoint in the receiver for the boat 's position when enabled and then begins displaying the distance and course back to that position in gps navigation , a '' route '' is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints gps receivers used in air navigation have databases which contain named waypoints , radio navigation aids , airports and heliports in air navigation , waypoints are sometimes defined as intersections between two vor radials , or in terms of specific distances and headings towards or away from a radio beacon waypoints may be a simple named point in space or may be associated with existing navigational aids , intersections , or fixes

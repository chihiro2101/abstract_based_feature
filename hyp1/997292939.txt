waypoints have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems , such as the global positioning system ( gps ) and certain other types of radio navigation although the term waypoint has only entered common use in recent years , the equivalent of a waypoint in all but name has existed for as long as human beings have navigated abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or utm coordinates plus the reference data , and often a name if they are marked on charts , and are located using a radio navigation system such as a vor or gps receiver waypoints can also be marked on a computer mapping program and uploaded to the gps receiver , marked on the receiver 's own internal map , or entered manually on the device as a pair of coordinates if the gps receiver has track-logging capabilities , one can also define waypoints after the fact from where one has been for example , marine gps receivers often have a '' man overboard '' function , which instantly creates a waypoint in the receiver for the boat 's position when enabled and then begins displaying the distance and course back to that position in gps navigation , a '' route '' is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints many gps receivers , both military and civilian , now offer integrated cartography databases ( also known as base maps ) , allowing users to locate a point on a map and define it as a waypoint gps receivers used in air navigation have databases which contain named waypoints , radio navigation aids , airports and heliports although the concept of waypoints has been greatly popularized among non-specialists by the development of the gps , waypoints can be used with other navigational aids for visual air navigation ( see the article on visual flight rules ) , waypoints may be directly associated with distinctive features on the ground that are easily identifiable from aircraft , such as stadiums , power plants , racetracks , etc a fly-by waypoint is a waypoint that marks the intersection of two straight paths , with the transition from one path to another being made by the aircraft using a precisely calculated turn that '' flies by '' but does not vertically cross the waypoint

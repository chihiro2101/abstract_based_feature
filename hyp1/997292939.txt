way-points are sets of coordinates that identify a point in physical space waypoints have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems , such as the global positioning system ( gps ) and certain other types of radio navigation , longitude and latitude ) ; those used in the earth 's atmosphere or in outer space are defined in at least three dimensions ( four if time is one of the coordinates , as it might be for some waypoints outside the earth ) today , these associations persist , but waypoints are more often associated with physical artifacts created specifically for navigation , such as radio beacons , buoys , satellites or control points abstract waypoints of this kind have been made practical by modern navigation technologies , such as land-based radio beacons and the satellite-based gps abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or utm coordinates plus the reference data , and often a name if they are marked on charts , and are located using a radio navigation system such as a vor or gps receiver a waypoint can be a destination , a fix along a planned course used to make a journey , or simply a point of reference useful for navigation gps systems are increasingly used to create and use waypoints in navigation of all kinds most receivers have the ability to compute a great circle route towards a waypoint , enabling them to find the shortest route even over long distances , although waypoints are often so closely spaced that this is not a factor many gps receivers , both military and civilian , now offer integrated cartography databases ( also known as base maps ) , allowing users to locate a point on a map and define it as a waypoint gps receivers used in air navigation have databases which contain named waypoints , radio navigation aids , airports and heliports for visual air navigation ( see the article on visual flight rules ) , waypoints may be directly associated with distinctive features on the ground that are easily identifiable from aircraft , such as stadiums , power plants , racetracks , etc

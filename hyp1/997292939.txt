way-points are sets of coordinates that identify a point in physical space waypoints have traditionally been associated with distinctive features of the real world , such as rock formations , springs , oasis , mountains , buildings , roadways , waterways , railways , and so on today , these associations persist , but waypoints are more often associated with physical artifacts created specifically for navigation , such as radio beacons , buoys , satellites or control points in the modern world , waypoints are increasingly abstract , often having no obvious relationship to any distinctive features of the real world these waypoints are used to help define invisible routing paths for navigation a waypoint can be a destination , a fix along a planned course used to make a journey , or simply a point of reference useful for navigation gps systems are increasingly used to create and use waypoints in navigation of all kinds a typical gps receiver can locate a waypoint with an accuracy of three meters or better when used with land-based assisting technologies such as the wide area augmentation system ( waas ) in gps navigation , a '' route '' is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints some gps systems intended for automobile navigation can generate a suggested driving route between two waypoints , based on the cartographic database gps receivers used in air navigation have databases which contain named waypoints , radio navigation aids , airports and heliports waypoints may be a simple named point in space or may be associated with existing navigational aids , intersections , or fixes

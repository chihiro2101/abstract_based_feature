when partition of india in 1947 , most indus sites , including mohenjo-daro and harappa , became part of pakistan the archaeological survey of india undertook a new program of exploration , and excavation between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti lothal stands from mohenjo-daro , which is in sindh the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern india two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years its constant threats - tropical storms and floods - caused immense destruction , which destabilised the culture and ultimately caused its end topography also shows signs that at about the time of its demise , the region suffered from aridity or weakened monsoon rainfall lothal is based upon a mound that was a salt marsh inundated by tide harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley the town was divided into blocks of 1–2-metre-high ( 3–6 & nbsp ; ft ) platforms of sun-dried bricks , each serving 20–30 houses of thick mud and brick walls the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order it was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting , but provided access to ships in high tide as well the warehouse was built close to the acropolis on a 3.5-metre-high ( 10.5 & nbsp ; ft ) podium of mud bricks the rulers could thus supervise the activity on the dock and warehouse simultaneously the town 's zealous rebuilding ensured the growth and prosperity of the trade however , with rising prosperity , lothal 's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities , possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond drains , manholes and cesspools kept the city clean and deposited the waste in the river , which was washed out during high tide lothal was a major trade centre , importing en masse raw materials like copper , chert and semi-precious stones from mohenjo-daro and harappa , and mass distributing to inner villages and towns bhagatrav supplied semi-precious stones while chank shell came from dholavira and bet dwarka one of the evidence of trade in lothal is the discovery of typical persian gulf seals , a circular button seal bridget , f while the wider debate over the end of indus civilisation continues , archaeological evidence gathered by the asi appears to point to natural catastrophes , specifically floods and storms as the source of lothal 's downfall a powerful flood submerged the town and destroyed most of the houses , with the walls and platforms heavily damaged the acropolis was levelled ( 2000–1900 & nbsp ; bce ) , and inhabited by common tradesmen and newly built makeshift houses the worst consequence was the shift in the course of the river , cutting off access to the ships and dock however , with a poorly organised government , and no outside agency or central government , the public works could not be properly repaired or maintained independent businesses caved , allowing a merchant-centric system of factories to develop where hundreds of craftsmen worked for the same supplier and financier archaeological analysis shows that the basin and dock were sealed with silt and debris , and the buildings razed to the ground the flood affected the entire region of saurashtra , sindh and south gujarat , and affected the upper reaches of the indus and sutlej , where scores of villages and townships were washed away while the trade and resources of the city were almost entirely gone , the people retained several harappan ways in writing , pottery , and utensils about this time asi archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from punjab and sindh into saurashtra and to the valley of sarasvati ( 1900–1700 & nbsp ; bce ) though indus seals went out of use , the system of weights with an 8.573 & nbsp ; gram ( 0.3024 & nbsp ; avoirdupois their work in metallurgy , seals , beads and jewellery was the basis of their prosperity rao also suggested that it could have functioned as an instrument for measuring angles and perhaps the position of stars and thus for navigation like a sextant lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear ( others found in harappa and mohenjodaro ) the scale is 6 & nbsp ; millimetres ( 0.2 & nbsp ; inches ) thick , broad and the available length is , but only 27 graduations are visible over , the distance between graduation lines being ( the small size indicates use for fine purposes ) animal worship is also evidenced , but not the worship of the mother goddess that is evidenced in other harappan cities—experts consider this a sign of the existence of diversity in religious traditions lothal produced a large quantity of gold ornaments—the most attractive item being microbeads of gold in five strands in necklaces , unique for being less than 0.25 & nbsp ; millimetres ( 0.010 & nbsp ; inches ) in diameter the methods of lothal bead-makers were so advanced that no improvements have been noted over 4,000 & nbsp ; years—modern makers in the khambhat area follow the same technique but thanks to the loam deposited by persistent floods , the dock walls were preserved beyond the great deluge ( c when the river changed its course in 2000 & nbsp ; bce , a smaller inlet , wide was made in the longer arm , connected to the river by a channel a coastal route may have existed linking sites such as lothal and dholavira to sutkagan dor on the makran coast rao , lothal : a harappan port town ( 1955–1962 ) ( memoirs of the archaeological survey of india ) asin : b0006e4eac paul yule , lothal

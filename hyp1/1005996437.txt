when partition of india in 1947 , most indus sites , including mohenjo-daro and harappa , became part of pakistan lothal stands from mohenjo-daro , which is in sindh the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains a silted creek connecting modern bholad with lothal and saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern india it is essentially a single culture site—the harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced an indigenous micaceous red ware culture also existed , which is believed to be autochthonous and pre-harappan two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the climate as well as natural disasters , as suggested by environmental magnetic records upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of freshwater for the inhabitants harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley lothal planners engaged themselves to protect the area from consistent floods the town was divided into blocks of 1–2-metre-high ( 3–6 & nbsp ; ft ) platforms of sun-dried bricks , each serving 20–30 houses of thick mud and brick walls the rulers of the town lived in the acropolis , which featured paved baths , underground and surface drains ( built of kiln-fired bricks ) and potable water well while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order it was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting , but provided access to ships in high tide as well the warehouse was built close to the acropolis on a 3.5-metre-high ( 10.5 & nbsp ; ft ) podium of mud bricks however , with rising prosperity , lothal 's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities , possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems the uniform organisation of the town and its institutions give evidence that the harappans were very disciplined people householders possessed a sump , or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city drains metalware , gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of lothal most of their equipment : metal tools , weights , measures , seals , earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the indus civilization lothal was a major trade centre , importing en masse raw materials like copper , chert and semi-precious stones from mohenjo-daro and harappa , and mass distributing to inner villages and towns it also produced large quantities of bronze celts , fish-hooks , chisels , spears and ornaments one of the evidence of trade in lothal is the discovery of typical persian gulf seals , a circular button seal bridget , f while the wider debate over the end of indus civilisation continues , archaeological evidence gathered by the asi appears to point to natural catastrophes , specifically floods and storms as the source of lothal 's downfall the acropolis was levelled ( 2000–1900 & nbsp ; bce ) , and inhabited by common tradesmen and newly built makeshift houses the worst consequence was the shift in the course of the river , cutting off access to the ships and dock independent businesses caved , allowing a merchant-centric system of factories to develop where hundreds of craftsmen worked for the same supplier and financier this is evidenced in adjacent cities of rangpur , rojdi , rupar and harappa in punjab , mohenjo-daro and chanhudaro in sindh 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) completely destroyed the flagging township in a single stroke archaeological evidence shows that the site continued to be inhabited , albeit by a much smaller population devoid of urban influences the few people who returned to lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city , but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions , living in poorly built houses and reed huts though indus seals went out of use , the system of weights with an 8.573 & nbsp ;

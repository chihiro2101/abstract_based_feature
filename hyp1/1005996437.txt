when partition of india in 1947 , most indus sites , including mohenjo-daro and harappa , became part of pakistan between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains a silted creek connecting modern bholad with lothal and saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern india it is essentially a single culture site—the harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years its constant threats - tropical storms and floods - caused immense destruction , which destabilised the culture and ultimately caused its end thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the climate as well as natural disasters , as suggested by environmental magnetic records lothal is based upon a mound that was a salt marsh inundated by tide small channel widths when compared to the lower reaches suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city the town was divided into blocks of 1–2-metre-high ( 3–6 & nbsp ; ft ) platforms of sun-dried bricks , each serving 20–30 houses of thick mud and brick walls the rulers of the town lived in the acropolis , which featured paved baths , underground and surface drains ( built of kiln-fired bricks ) and potable water well a north-south arterial street was the main commercial area the lower town was also periodically enlarged during lothal 's years of prosperity lothal engineers accorded high priority to the creation of a dockyard and a warehouse to serve the purposes of naval trade while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order the warehouse was built close to the acropolis on a 3.5-metre-high ( 10.5 & nbsp ; ft ) podium of mud bricks throughout their time , the city had to brace itself through multiple floods and storms dock and city peripheral walls were maintained efficiently all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond the uniform organisation of the town and its institutions give evidence that the harappans were very disciplined people householders possessed a sump , or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city drains drains , manholes and cesspools kept the city clean and deposited the waste in the river , which was washed out during high tide it also produced large quantities of bronze celts , fish-hooks , chisels , spears and ornaments lothal exported its beads , gemstones , ivory and shells the acropolis was levelled ( 2000–1900 & nbsp ; bce ) , and inhabited by common tradesmen and newly built makeshift houses the people built a new but shallow inlet to connect the flow channel to the dock for sluicing small ships into the basin however , with a poorly organised government , and no outside agency or central government , the public works could not be properly repaired or maintained the declining prosperity of the town , paucity of resources and poor administration increased the woes of a people pressured by consistent floods and storms the few people who returned to lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city , but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions , living in poorly built houses and reed huts while the trade and resources of the city were almost entirely gone , the people retained several harappan ways in writing , pottery , and utensils though indus seals went out of use , the system of weights with an 8.573 & nbsp ; gram ( 0.3024 & nbsp ; avoirdupois rao also suggested that it could have functioned as an instrument for measuring angles and perhaps the position of stars and thus for navigation like a sextant lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear ( others found in harappa and mohenjodaro ) on average , the main sewer is in depth , with outer dimensions of 86 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 68 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 33 & nbsp ; cm ( 34 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 27 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 13 & nbsp ; in ) archaeologists estimate that in most cases , the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides , in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of lothal scale of the people of lothal worshipped a fire god , speculated to be the horned deity depicted on seals , which is also evidenced by the presence of private and public fire-altars where religious ceremonies were apparently conducted they also employed advanced metallurgy in following the cire perdue technique of casting , and used more than one-piece moulds for casting birds and animals a large disc with holes recovered from a sacrificial altar is compared to the rukma worn by vedic priests the discovery of etched carnelian beads and non-etched barrel beads in kish and ur ( modern iraq ) , jalalabad ( afghanistan ) and susa ( iran ) attest to the popularity of the indus bead industry across west asia double-eye beads of agate and collared or gold-capped beads of jasper and carnelian beads are among those attributed as uniquely from lothal the ruler 's residence is in area with a 1.8-square-meter-bath ( 19 & nbsp ;

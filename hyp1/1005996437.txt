when partition of india in 1947 , most indus sites , including mohenjo-daro and harappa , became part of pakistan the archaeological survey of india undertook a new program of exploration , and excavation many sites were discovered across northwestern india between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti lothal stands from mohenjo-daro , which is in sindh the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains a silted creek connecting modern bholad with lothal and saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat lothal provides with the largest collection of antiquities in the archaeology of modern india lothal is based upon a mound that was a salt marsh inundated by tide small channel widths when compared to the lower reaches suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city upstream elements of this river provided a suitable source of freshwater for the inhabitants harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley lothal planners engaged themselves to protect the area from consistent floods the lower town was also periodically enlarged during lothal 's years of prosperity while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order it was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting , but provided access to ships in high tide as well dock and city peripheral walls were maintained efficiently however , with rising prosperity , lothal 's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities , possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems a flood of moderate intensity in 2050 & nbsp ; bce exposed some serious weaknesses in the structure , but the problems were not addressed properly all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond the uniform organisation of the town and its institutions give evidence that the harappans were very disciplined people commerce and administrative duties were performed according to standards laid out metalware , gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of lothal most of their equipment : metal tools , weights , measures , seals , earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the indus civilization lothal exported its beads , gemstones , ivory and shells while the wider debate over the end of indus civilisation continues , archaeological evidence gathered by the asi appears to point to natural catastrophes , specifically floods and storms as the source of lothal 's downfall the people built a new but shallow inlet to connect the flow channel to the dock for sluicing small ships into the basin the heavily damaged warehouse was never repaired properly , and stocks were stored in wooden canopies , exposed to floods and fire independent businesses caved , allowing a merchant-centric system of factories to develop where hundreds of craftsmen worked for the same supplier and financier this is evidenced in adjacent cities of rangpur , rojdi , rupar and harappa in punjab , mohenjo-daro and chanhudaro in sindh a massive flood ( c archaeological analysis shows that the basin and dock were sealed with silt and debris , and the buildings razed to the ground the few people who returned to lothal could not reconstruct and repair their city , but surprisingly continued to stay and preserved religious traditions , living in poorly built houses and reed huts about this time asi archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from punjab and sindh into saurashtra and to the valley of sarasvati ( 1900–1700 & nbsp ;

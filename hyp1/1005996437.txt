when partition of india in 1947 , most indus sites , including mohenjo-daro and harappa , became part of pakistan between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti lothal stands from mohenjo-daro , which is in sindh the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains a silted creek connecting modern bholad with lothal and saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat it is essentially a single culture site—the harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years 2350 & nbsp ; bce ) harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley lothal planners engaged themselves to protect the area from consistent floods the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order it was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting , but provided access to ships in high tide as well the warehouse was built close to the acropolis on a 3.5-metre-high ( 10.5 & nbsp ; ft ) podium of mud bricks the rulers could thus supervise the activity on the dock and warehouse simultaneously there was an important public building opposite to the warehouse whose superstructure has completely disappeared throughout their time , the city had to brace itself through multiple floods and storms however , with rising prosperity , lothal 's people failed to upkeep their walls and dock facilities , possibly as a result of over-confidence in their systems all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond . economy and urban culture the uniform organisation of the town and its institutions give evidence that the harappans were very disciplined people municipal administration was strict – the width of most streets remained the same over a long time , and no encroached structures were built householders possessed a sump , or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city drains metalware , gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of lothal most of their equipment : metal tools , weights , measures , seals , earthenware and ornaments were of the uniform standard and quality found across the indus civilization lothal was a major trade centre , importing en masse raw materials like copper , chert and semi-precious stones from mohenjo-daro and harappa , and mass distributing to inner villages and towns the stone blade industry catered to domestic needs—fine chert was imported from the larkana valley or from bijapur in modern karnataka one of the evidence of trade in lothal is the discovery of typical persian gulf seals , a circular button seal bridget , f the acropolis was levelled ( 2000–1900 & nbsp ; bce ) , and inhabited by common tradesmen and newly built makeshift houses the people built a new but shallow inlet to connect the flow channel to the dock for sluicing small ships into the basin the heavily damaged warehouse was never repaired properly , and stocks were stored in wooden canopies , exposed to floods and fire about this time asi archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from punjab and sindh into saurashtra and to the valley of sarasvati ( 1900–1700 & nbsp ; bce ) the people of lothal made significant and often unique contributions to human civilisation in the indus era , in the fields of city planning , art , architecture , science , engineering , pottery , and religion lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear ( others found in harappa and mohenjodaro ) an ivory scale from lothal has the smallest-known decimal divisions in indus civilisation the scale is 6 & nbsp ; millimetres ( 0.2 & nbsp ; inches ) thick , broad and the available length is , but only 27 graduations are visible over , the distance between graduation lines being ( the small size indicates use for fine purposes ) the extent of drains provided archaeologists with many clues regarding the layout of streets , organisation of housing and baths on average , the main sewer is in depth , with outer dimensions of 86 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 68 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 33 & nbsp ; cm ( 34 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 27 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 13 & nbsp ; in ) lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks , designed with care in regards to thickness of structures archaeologists estimate that in most cases , the bricks were in ratio 1:0.5:0.25 on three sides , in dimensions which were integral multiples of large graduations of lothal scale of animal worship is also evidenced , but not the worship of the mother goddess that is evidenced in other harappan cities—experts consider this a sign of the existence of diversity in religious traditions today , the local villagers likewise worship a sea goddess , vanuvati sikotarimata , suggesting a connection with the ancient port 's traditions and historical past as an access to the sea but the archaeologists also discovered that the practice had been given up by 2000 & nbsp ; bce ( determined by the difference in burial times of the carbon-dated remains ) lothal copper is unusually pure , lacking the arsenic typically used by coppersmiths across the rest of the indus valley rao , lothal : a harappan port town ( 1955–1962 ) ( memoirs of the archaeological survey of india ) asin : b0006e4eac paul yule , lothal ) , the lost sarasvati and the indus civilization ( 1995 ) , kusumanjali prakashan , jodhpur jonathan mark kenoyer , ancient cities of the indus valley civilization ( 1998 ) oxford university press ,

the archaeological survey of india undertook a new program of exploration , and excavation between 1954 and 1958 , more than 50 sites were excavated in the kutch ( notably dholavira ) , and saurashtra peninsulas , extending the limits of harappan civilisation by to the river kim , where the bhagatrav site accesses the valley of the rivers narmada and tapti the meaning of lothal ( a combination of loth and ( s ) thal ) in gujarati to be '' the mound of the dead '' is not unusual , as the name of the city of mohenjo-daro in sindhi means the same people in villages neighbouring to lothal had known of the presence of an ancient town and human remains a silted creek connecting modern bholad with lothal and saragwala represents the ancient flow channel of a river or creek speculation suggests that owing to the comparatively small dimensions of the main city , lothal was not a large settlement at all , and its '' dock '' was perhaps an irrigation tank however , the asi and other contemporary archaeologists assert that the city was a part of a major river system on the trade route of the ancient peoples from sindh to saurashtra in gujarat it is essentially a single culture site—the harappan culture in all its variances is evidenced an indigenous micaceous red ware culture also existed , which is believed to be autochthonous and pre-harappan two sub-periods of harappan culture are distinguished : the same period ( between 2400 and 1900 & nbsp ; bce ) is identical to the exuberant culture of harappa and mohenjo-daro after the core of the indus civilisation had decayed in mohenjo-daro and harappa , lothal seems not only to have survived but to have thrived for many years its constant threats - tropical storms and floods - caused immense destruction , which destabilised the culture and ultimately caused its end topography also shows signs that at about the time of its demise , the region suffered from aridity or weakened monsoon rainfall thus the cause for the abandonment of the city may have been changes in the climate as well as natural disasters , as suggested by environmental magnetic records lothal is based upon a mound that was a salt marsh inundated by tide small channel widths when compared to the lower reaches suggest the presence of a strong tidal influence upon the city—tidal waters ingressed up to and beyond the city harappans based around lothal and from sindh took this opportunity to expand their settlement and create a planned township on the lines of greater cities in the indus valley the rulers of the town lived in the acropolis , which featured paved baths , underground and surface drains ( built of kiln-fired bricks ) and potable water well the lower town was subdivided into two sectors the lower town was also periodically enlarged during lothal 's years of prosperity lothal engineers accorded high priority to the creation of a dockyard and a warehouse to serve the purposes of naval trade while the consensus view amongst archaeologists identifies this structure as a '' dockyard , '' it has also been suggested that owing to small dimensions , this basin may have been an irrigation tank and canal the dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order a flood of moderate intensity in 2050 & nbsp ; bce exposed some serious weaknesses in the structure , but the problems were not addressed properly all the construction were made of fire dried bricks , lime and sand mortar and not by sun-dried bricks as bricks are still intact after 4000 years and still bonded together with each other with the mortar bond commerce and administrative duties were performed according to standards laid out municipal administration was strict – the width of most streets remained the same over a long time , and no encroached structures were built householders possessed a sump , or collection chamber to deposit solid waste in order to prevent the clogging of city drains metalware , gold and jewellery and tastefully decorated ornaments attest to the culture and prosperity of the people of lothal while the wider debate over the end of indus civilisation continues , archaeological evidence gathered by the asi appears to point to natural catastrophes , specifically floods and storms as the source of lothal 's downfall a powerful flood submerged the town and destroyed most of the houses , with the walls and platforms heavily damaged however , with a poorly organised government , and no outside agency or central government , the public works could not be properly repaired or maintained trade volumes reduced greatly , though not catastrophically , and resources were available in lesser quantities independent businesses caved , allowing a merchant-centric system of factories to develop where hundreds of craftsmen worked for the same supplier and financier this is evidenced in adjacent cities of rangpur , rojdi , rupar and harappa in punjab , mohenjo-daro and chanhudaro in sindh about this time asi archaeologists record a mass movement of refugees from punjab and sindh into saurashtra and to the valley of sarasvati ( 1900–1700 & nbsp ; bce ) though indus seals went out of use , the system of weights with an 8.573 & nbsp ; gram ( 0.3024 & nbsp ; avoirdupois lothal contributes one of three measurement scales that are integrated and linear ( others found in harappa and mohenjodaro ) an ivory scale from lothal has the smallest-known decimal divisions in indus civilisation on average , the main sewer is in depth , with outer dimensions of 86 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 68 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 33 & nbsp ; cm ( 34 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 27 & nbsp ; × & nbsp ; 13 & nbsp ; in ) lothal brick-makers used a logical approach in manufacture of bricks , designed with care in regards to thickness of structures archaeologists have discovered gold pendants , charred ashes of terra-cotta cakes and pottery , bovine remains , beads and other signs that may indicate the practice of the gavamayana sacrifice , associated with the ancient vedic religion it is also considered that given the small number of graves discovered—only 17 in an estimated population of 15,000—the citizens of lothal also practised cremation of the dead they also invented new tools such as curved saws and twisted drills unknown to other civilisations at the time officials blame the salinity on capillary action and point out that cracks are emerging and foundations weakening even as restoration work slowly progresses this knowledge also enabled them to select lothal 's location in the first place , as the gulf of khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary rao , lothal and the indus civilisation s rao , lothal : a harappan port town ( 1955–1962 ) ( memoirs of the archaeological survey of india ) asin : b0006e4eac paul yule , lothal ) , the lost sarasvati and the indus civilization ( 1995 ) , kusumanjali prakashan , jodhpur jonathan mark kenoyer , ancient cities of the indus valley civilization ( 1998 ) oxford university press ,

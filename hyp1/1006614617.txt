the east midlands had for some years been at centre of plans to link the major cities throughout the country however , the mcr came about as a result of competition to supply coal to leicester , a town which was rapidly industrialising and was a valuable market for coal for many years , the nottinghamshire coal miners had enjoyed a competitive advantage over their counterparts in leicestershire , but in 1832 the latter opened the leicester and swannington railway on 16 august 1832 , at one of the nottinghamshire miner 's regular meetings at the sun inn , at eastwood the idea was mooted to extend the mansfield and pinxton railway to leicester in the derby mercury of 17 october 1832 , the new railway was referred to as the midland counties ' railway subscriptions had been obtained from lancashire investors and with the imminent completion of the london and birmingham railway , they insisted that the line should continue to join it at rugby , warwickshire at last the plans were ready to put before parliament in its 1834 session not surprisingly , at that late stage , it was refused such a line would have been longer and more expensive , shortening the journey to london by very little , but extending that to birmingham excessively by that time , the north midland railway and birmingham and derby junction railway had been formed with the intention of meeting at derby at the same time , the birmingham and derby link with the london and birmingham railway in a southwards direction at hampton-in-arden , threatened the midland counties at last in 1836 the midland counties ' railway bill went before parliament and survived its passage through the house of commons secondly , the bill still included the pinxton line , to the extreme annoyance of the birmingham and derby line 's directors there was a distinct possibility that the lords would insist that the north midland was connected to it instead of proceeding to derby , losing the nmr some twenty miles of line and its connection to birmingham and the west country contracts were awarded for the derby to trent junction portion by april 1837 for Â£3,000 under the estimate with an forecast of completion by september 1838 the contract for the works in nottingham were signed in june 1837 and construction started immediately by september 1837 it was reported that 400 men were employed in three different places on the line between nottingham and derby the contractor for long eaton to nottingham was messrs initially the railway ran into a temporary platform at derby , but at nottingham a magnificent terminus had been built in carrington street the inaugural run took place from nottingham on 30 may 1839 , with a timetabled public service beginning on 4 june initially the midland counties ' railway did not prosper due to competition from the birmingham and derby junction railway which also transported coal from the east midlands to london , via hampton-in-arden most of the original midland counties ' railway line between nottingham , derby and leicester is still operating today as part of the midland main line the derby railway history research group ( 1989 ) the midland counties railway , railway & canal historical society , anon ( 1996 ) derby and the midland railway , derby : breedon books , ellis , c

however , the mcr came about as a result of competition to supply coal to leicester , a town which was rapidly industrialising and was a valuable market for coal the competition was between the coalville area of leicestershire , and the erewash valley area of nottinghamshire on 16 august 1832 , at one of the nottinghamshire miner 's regular meetings at the sun inn , at eastwood the idea was mooted to extend the mansfield and pinxton railway to leicester in the derby mercury of 17 october 1832 , the new railway was referred to as the midland counties ' railway subscriptions had been obtained from lancashire investors and with the imminent completion of the london and birmingham railway , they insisted that the line should continue to join it at rugby , warwickshire in october an alternative plan was proposed of bringing in nottingham and derby , as well as leicester , using a junction at long eaton , with the stated aim that it would reduce any differences in coal prices between them it has been suggested that , having opposed the london and birmingham , they had seen the error of their ways such a line would have been longer and more expensive , shortening the journey to london by very little , but extending that to birmingham excessively by that time , the north midland railway and birmingham and derby junction railway had been formed with the intention of meeting at derby the line to pinxton threatened it , particularly as , in 1834 , the midland counties had mooted the possibility of an extension to clay cross at the same time , the birmingham and derby link with the london and birmingham railway in a southwards direction at hampton-in-arden , threatened the midland counties at last in 1836 the midland counties ' railway bill went before parliament and survived its passage through the house of commons secondly , the bill still included the pinxton line , to the extreme annoyance of the birmingham and derby line 's directors since this was the original reason for building the railway , one can imagine the feelings of the nottinghamshire miners contracts were awarded for the derby to trent junction portion by april 1837 for £3,000 under the estimate with an forecast of completion by september 1838 the contractor for the works between derby , long eaton and loughborough was william mackenzie of chorley , lancashire the only obstacle was the derby canal which would need to be diverted at borrowash , the canal owners asking £2 for every hour that it was closed the inaugural run took place from nottingham on 30 may 1839 , with a timetabled public service beginning on 4 june , ( 1995 ) the directory of railway stations , yeovil : patrick stephens initially the midland counties ' railway did not prosper due to competition from the birmingham and derby junction railway which also transported coal from the east midlands to london , via hampton-in-arden in 1844 , the birmingham and derby junction railway , the midland counties ' railway and the north midland railway merged to form the new midland railway most of the original midland counties ' railway line between nottingham , derby and leicester is still operating today as part of the midland main line although the old north midlands through derby is the main express line ( since trains have to reverse at nottingham ) , there is still a half-hourly service from nottingham itself to london ( 1996 ) derby and the midland railway , derby : breedon books , ellis , c

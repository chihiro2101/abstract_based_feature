for many years , the nottinghamshire coal miners had enjoyed a competitive advantage over their counterparts in leicestershire , but in 1832 the latter opened the leicester and swannington railway on 16 august 1832 , at one of the nottinghamshire miner 's regular meetings at the sun inn , at eastwood the idea was mooted to extend the mansfield and pinxton railway to leicester in the derby mercury of 17 october 1832 , the new railway was referred to as the midland counties ' railway subscriptions had been obtained from lancashire investors and with the imminent completion of the london and birmingham railway , they insisted that the line should continue to join it at rugby , warwickshire in october an alternative plan was proposed of bringing in nottingham and derby , as well as leicester , using a junction at long eaton , with the stated aim that it would reduce any differences in coal prices between them the scheme was delayed for yet another year , during which time charles vignoles was asked to review the plans and become the company 's engineer at this point , the citizens of northampton campaigned for the line to pass through their town rather than rugby such a line would have been longer and more expensive , shortening the journey to london by very little , but extending that to birmingham excessively by that time , the north midland railway and birmingham and derby junction railway had been formed with the intention of meeting at derby at the same time , the birmingham and derby link with the london and birmingham railway in a southwards direction at hampton-in-arden , threatened the midland counties at last in 1836 the midland counties ' railway bill went before parliament and survived its passage through the house of commons secondly , the bill still included the pinxton line , to the extreme annoyance of the birmingham and derby line 's directors there was a distinct possibility that the lords would insist that the north midland was connected to it instead of proceeding to derby , losing the nmr some twenty miles of line and its connection to birmingham and the west country since this was the original reason for building the railway , one can imagine the feelings of the nottinghamshire miners in january 1837 the company issued invitations to tender for three contracts , derby to trent junction , nottingham to trent junction and trent junction to sutton bonington the contract for the section from trent junction to sutton bonington was let in may 1837 the contract for the works in nottingham were signed in june 1837 and construction started immediately by september 1837 it was reported that 400 men were employed in three different places on the line between nottingham and derby initially the railway ran into a temporary platform at derby , but at nottingham a magnificent terminus had been built in carrington street initially the midland counties ' railway did not prosper due to competition from the birmingham and derby junction railway which also transported coal from the east midlands to london , via hampton-in-arden hudson foresaw that the directors of the mcr would resist the idea and made a secret agreement with the b & djr for the nmr to take it over in 1844 , the birmingham and derby junction railway , the midland counties ' railway and the north midland railway merged to form the new midland railway most of the original midland counties ' railway line between nottingham , derby and leicester is still operating today as part of the midland main line ( 1996 ) derby and the midland railway , derby : breedon books , ellis , c

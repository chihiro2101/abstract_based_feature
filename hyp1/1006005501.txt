as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person , several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined , based on the most common phenotypic features , symptoms , and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components they may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs , infections , or other environmental causes nuclear dna has two copies per cell ( except for sperm and egg cells ) , one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother mitochondrial dna , however , is inherited from the mother only ( with some exceptions ) and each mitochondrion typically contains between 2 and 10 mtdna copies as mtdna is copied when mitochondria proliferate , they can accumulate random mutations , a phenomenon called heteroplasmy if only a few of the mtdna copies inherited from the mother are defective , mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria ( for more detailed inheritance patterns , see human mitochondrial genetics ) mitochondria possess many of the same dna repair pathways as nuclei doâ€”but not all of them ; therefore , mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial dna than in nuclear dna ( see mutation rate ) this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) , where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind , is an ivf treatment procedure the mitochondrial and metabolic disease center because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets , some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare

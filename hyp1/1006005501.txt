defects often affect the operation of the mitochondria and multiple tissues more severely , leading to multi-system diseases as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components they may also be the result of acquired mitochondrial dysfunction due to adverse effects of drugs , infections , or other environmental causes oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction mitochondrial dna , however , is inherited from the mother only ( with some exceptions ) and each mitochondrion typically contains between 2 and 10 mtdna copies those mitochondria make more copies , normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' mitochondria possess many of the same dna repair pathways as nuclei doâ€”but not all of them ; therefore , mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial dna than in nuclear dna ( see mutation rate ) this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations most mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by nuclear dna the mitochondrial and metabolic disease center because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets , some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare

defects often affect the operation of the mitochondria and multiple tissues more severely , leading to multi-system diseases as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction nuclear dna has two copies per cell ( except for sperm and egg cells ) , one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain , while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded defects in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are associated with hundreds of clinical disease phenotypes including anemia , dementia , hypertension , lymphoma , retinopathy , seizures , and neurodevelopmental disorders mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) , where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind , is an ivf treatment procedure human genetic engineering was used on a small scale to allow infertile women with genetic defects in their mitochondria to have children the mitochondrial and metabolic disease center because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets , some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare charlie gard , a british boy who suffered from mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome ; decisions about his care were taken to various law courts

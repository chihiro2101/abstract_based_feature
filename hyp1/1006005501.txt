mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction nuclear dna has two copies per cell ( except for sperm and egg cells ) , one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother mitochondrial dna , however , is inherited from the mother only ( with some exceptions ) and each mitochondrion typically contains between 2 and 10 mtdna copies during cell division the mitochondria segregate randomly between the two new cells those mitochondria make more copies , normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell as mtdna is copied when mitochondria proliferate , they can accumulate random mutations , a phenomenon called heteroplasmy if only a few of the mtdna copies inherited from the mother are defective , mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria ( for more detailed inheritance patterns , see human mitochondrial genetics ) mitochondria possess many of the same dna repair pathways as nuclei doâ€”but not all of them ; therefore , mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial dna than in nuclear dna ( see mutation rate ) this means that mitochondrial dna disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations defects in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are associated with hundreds of clinical disease phenotypes including anemia , dementia , hypertension , lymphoma , retinopathy , seizures , and neurodevelopmental disorders other studies have shown that the mechanism may involve the interruption of the mitochondrial signaling process in body cells ( intramyocellular lipids )

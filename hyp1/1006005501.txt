defects often affect the operation of the mitochondria and multiple tissues more severely , leading to multi-system diseases as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body although mitochondrial diseases vary greatly in presentation from person to person , several major clinical categories of these conditions have been defined , based on the most common phenotypic features , symptoms , and signs associated with the particular mutations that tend to cause them mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components oxalate may enter cells where it is known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction mitochondrial dna , however , is inherited from the mother only ( with some exceptions ) and each mitochondrion typically contains between 2 and 10 mtdna copies mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial dna replication ( all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear dna ) may also cause mitochondrial dna mutations most mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by nuclear dna human mitochondrial dna encodes 13 proteins of the respiratory chain , while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded defects in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are associated with hundreds of clinical disease phenotypes including anemia , dementia , hypertension , lymphoma , retinopathy , seizures , and neurodevelopmental disorders mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) , where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind , is an ivf treatment procedure the mitochondrial and metabolic disease center because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets , some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare

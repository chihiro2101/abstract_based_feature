defects often affect the operation of the mitochondria and multiple tissues more severely , leading to multi-system diseases as a rule , mitochondrial diseases are worse when the defective mitochondria are present in the muscles , cerebrum , or nerves , because these cells use more energy than most other cells in the body an outstanding question and area of research is whether atp depletion or reactive oxygen species are in fact responsible for the observed phenotypic consequences mitochondrial disorders may be caused by mutations ( acquired or inherited ) , in mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) , or in nuclear genes that code for mitochondrial components nuclear dna has two copies per cell ( except for sperm and egg cells ) , one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother those mitochondria make more copies , normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level ; this phenomenon is called '' threshold expression '' most mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by nuclear dna the effective overall energy unit for the available body energy is referred to as the daily glycogen generation capacity , and is used to compare the mitochondrial output of healthy individuals to that of afflicted or chronically glycogen-depleted individuals the glycogen generation capacity is entirely dependent on , and determined by , the operating levels of the mitochondria in all of the cells of the human body ; however , the relation between the energy generated by the mitochondria and the glycogen capacity is very loose and is mediated by many biochemical pathways the most common tests for the detection of these diseases are : southern blot to detect big deletions or duplications polymerase chain reaction and specific mutation testing sequencing mitochondrial replacement therapy ( mrt ) , where the nuclear dna is transferred to another healthy egg cell leaving the defective mitochondrial dna behind , is an ivf treatment procedure the mitochondrial and metabolic disease center because mitochondrial disorders contain many variations and subsets , some particular mitochondrial disorders are very rare

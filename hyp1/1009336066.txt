here are three lists of municipalities for each one of the three regions : list of municipalities of the brussels-capital region ( 19 municipalities ) list of municipalities of the flemish region ( 300 municipalities ) list of municipalities of the walloon region ( 262 municipalities ) the municipalities , as an administrative division , were officially created in 1795 , when the directoire reorganised the structures of the ancien r√©gime the number of municipalities was reduced to 2,508 when the belgian borders were recognised in 1839 , as 124 municipalities were ceded to the netherlands and another 119 municipalities became the grand duchy of luxembourg ( see the article communes of luxembourg for details ) as only a law carried by special majorities can change the language status of any municipality , these arrangements have prevented some small municipalities with facilities to be merged in the 1970s , and thus the most minute belgian municipalities are still found in this group , notably herstappe with only 84 inhabitants ( in 2006 ) the merger of antwerp with the municipalities of berchem , borgerhout , deurne , hoboken , ekeren , merksem and wilrijk in 1983 finally reduced the number of municipalities in belgium to 589 and was the last reorganization of the municipalities for several decades because the merger of the 19 municipalities of brussels was postponed indefinitely the fifth state reform ( 2001 ) transferred the responsibility over municipalities from the federal level to the three regions this did not instantly have any significant effect on the reorganisation of municipalities , up until the flemish bourgeois government ( 2014-2019 ) provided a legal framework and financial incentives for municipalities to consider merging in the flemish region and the brussels-capital region , the mayor is appointed by the regional government , on the nomination of the municipal council , for a term of office of six years in the wallonia , the mayor is the municipal councillor who received the largest number of preferential votes of the majority party that received the largest number of votes in the municipal elections it is also possible in the walloon region for the municipal council to adopt a constructive motion of no confidence in the municipal college the executive organ of the municipality is known as the college of mayor and aldermen ; , commonly referred to as the college of aldermen ; , in the flemish region and the brussels-capital region , and as the municipal college ; in the wallonia communities , regions and language areas of belgium list of belgian municipalities by population list of cities in belgium list of postal codes in belgium municipalities with language facilities provinces of belgium public centre for social welfare ( cpas , ocmw )

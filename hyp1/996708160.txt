according to the ronen fissile rule , for a heavy element with 90 ≤ z ≤ 100 , its isotopes with 2 × z − n 43 ± 2 , with few exceptions , are fissile ( where n number of neutrons and z number of protons ) uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission ; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material , & nbsp ; are fissionable ) and also produce neutrons from such fission that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the correct setting under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction as such , while all fissile isotopes are fissionable , not all fissionable isotopes are fissile fissile materials and nuclear weapons , international panel on fissile materials these are materials that sustain an explosive fast neutron nuclear fission chain reaction , & nbsp ; a speed of about 14,000 & nbsp ; km/s ) , the fission threshold to cause subsequent fission of , so fission of does not sustain a nuclear chain reaction more generally , nuclides with an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons , and located near a well-known curve in nuclear physics of atomic number vs uranium-233 bred from thorium-232 by neutron capture fissile nuclides do not have a 100 % chance of undergoing fission on absorption of a neutron

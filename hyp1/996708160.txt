'' fissile '' is distinct from '' fissionable '' a fissionable nuclide that can be induced to fission with low-energy thermal neutrons with a high probability is referred to as '' fissile '' fissionable materials include also those ( such as uranium-238 ) that can be fissioned only with high-energy neutrons uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission ; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material consequently , uranium-238 is a fissionable material but not a fissile material an alternative definition defines fissile nuclides as those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission ( i.e , & nbsp ; are fissionable ) and also produce neutrons from such fission that can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the correct setting under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction fissile materials and nuclear weapons , international panel on fissile materials these are materials that sustain an explosive fast neutron nuclear fission chain reaction

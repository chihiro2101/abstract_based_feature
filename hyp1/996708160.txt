according to the ronen fissile rule , for a heavy element with 90 ≤ z ≤ 100 , its isotopes with 2 × z − n 43 ± 2 , with few exceptions , are fissile ( where n number of neutrons and z number of protons ) uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission ; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material consequently , uranium-238 is a fissionable material but not a fissile material under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction in the arms control context , particularly in proposals for a fissile material cutoff treaty , the term '' fissile '' is often used to describe materials that can be used in the fission primary of a nuclear weapon fissile materials and nuclear weapons , international panel on fissile materials these are materials that sustain an explosive fast neutron nuclear fission chain reaction , & nbsp ; a speed of about 14,000 & nbsp ; km/s ) , the fission threshold to cause subsequent fission of , so fission of does not sustain a nuclear chain reaction most nuclear fuels have an odd atomic mass number ( a z + n the total number of nucleons ) , and an even atomic number z to be a useful fuel for nuclear fission chain reactions , the material must : be in the region of the binding energy curve where a fission chain reaction is possible ( i.e

according to the ronen fissile rule , for a heavy element with 90 ≤ z ≤ 100 , its isotopes with 2 × z − n 43 ± 2 , with few exceptions , are fissile ( where n number of neutrons and z number of protons ) group '' note '' > the fissile rule thus formulated indicates 33 isotopes as likely fissile : th-225 , 227 , 229 ; pa-228 , 230 , 232 ; u-231 , 233 , 235 ; np-234 , 236 , 238 ; pu-237 , 239 , 241 ; am-240 , 242 , 244 ; cm-243 , 245 , 247 ; bk-246 , 248 , 250 ; cf-249 , 251 , 253 ; es-252 , 254 , 256 ; fm-255 , 257 , 259 a fissionable nuclide that can be induced to fission with low-energy thermal neutrons with a high probability is referred to as '' fissile '' uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission ; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material by contrast , the binding energy released by uranium-238 absorbing a thermal neutron is less than the critical energy , so the neutron must possess additional energy for fission to be possible consequently , uranium-238 is a fissionable material but not a fissile material under this definition , the only nuclides that are fissionable but not fissile are those nuclides that can be made to undergo nuclear fission but produce insufficient neutrons , in either energy or number , to sustain a nuclear chain reaction fissile materials and nuclear weapons , international panel on fissile materials these are materials that sustain an explosive fast neutron nuclear fission chain reaction to be a useful fuel for nuclear fission chain reactions , the material must : be in the region of the binding energy curve where a fission chain reaction is possible ( i.e

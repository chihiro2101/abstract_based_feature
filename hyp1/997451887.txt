a spin network , as described in penrose ( 1971 ) , r ) , quantum theory and beyond , cambridge university press ( this paper can be found online on john c diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called closed spin networks each line segment is labelled with an integer called a spin number for fermions , such as electrons and quarks , n is odd given any closed spin network , a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network however , they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm , two requirements must be met at each vertex in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) , a spin network represents a '' quantum state '' of the gravitational field on a 3-dimensional hypersurface is the spin associated with the link i of the spin network one can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary '' quantum of volume '' and every link is a '' quantum of area '' surrounding this volume levin and xiao-gang wen have also defined string-nets using tensor category that are objects very similar to spin networks in mathematics , spin networks have been used to study skein modules and character variety , which correspond to spaces of connections

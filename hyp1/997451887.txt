a spin network , as described in penrose ( 1971 ) , r ) , quantum theory and beyond , cambridge university press ( this paper can be found online on john c 241 ( the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to roger penrose , '' on the origins of twistor theory '' in : gravitation and geometry , a volume in honour of i a vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called closed spin networks given any closed spin network , a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network however , they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm , two requirements must be met at each vertex every spin network is an eigenstate of each such operator , and the area eigenvalue equals : a_ where the sum goes over all intersections i of Ïƒ with the spin network is the spin associated with the link i of the spin network according to this formula , the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation one can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary '' quantum of volume '' and every link is a '' quantum of area '' surrounding this volume in mathematics , spin networks have been used to study skein modules and character variety , which correspond to spaces of connections

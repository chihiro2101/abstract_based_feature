a spin network , as described in penrose ( 1971 ) , r ) , quantum theory and beyond , cambridge university press ( this paper can be found online on john c ) , combinatorial mathematics and its applications ( proc each line segment is labelled with an integer called a spin number given any closed spin network , a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the norm of the spin network norms can be used to calculate the probabilities of various spin values for example , a 3 , b 4 , c 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 13 is odd , and a 3 , b 4 , c 9 is impossible since 9 > 3 + 4 a spin network , immersed into a manifold , can be used to define a functional on the space of connections on this manifold one of the key results of loop quantum gravity is quantization of areas : the operator of the area a of a two-dimensional surface Ïƒ should have a discrete spectrum is the spin associated with the link i of the spin network however the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet character variety penrose graphical notation spin foam string-net trace diagram

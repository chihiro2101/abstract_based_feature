cliff comes from the old english word clif of essentially the same meaning , cognate with dutch , low german , and old norse klif 'cliff' given that a cliff does not need to be exactly vertical , there can be ambiguity about whether a given slope is a cliff or not and also about how much of a certain slope to count as a cliff for example , given a truly vertical rock wall above a very steep slope , one could count just the rock wall or the combination the highest very steep non-vertical cliffs in the world are nanga parbat 's rupal face and gyala peri 's southeast face , which both rise approximately 4,600 m , or 15,000 ft , above their base according to other sources , the highest cliff in the world , about 1,340 m high , is the east face of great trango in the karakoram mountains of northern pakistan this uses a fairly stringent notion of cliff , as the 1,340 m figure refers to a nearly vertical headwall of two stacked pillars ; adding in a very steep approach brings the total drop from the east face precipice to the nearby dunge glacier to nearly 2,000 m the location of the world 's highest sea cliffs depends also on the definition of 'cliff ' that is used these are subject to a less stringent definition , as the average slope of these cliffs at kaulapapa is about 1.7 , corresponding to an angle of 60 degrees , and mitre peak is similar however , other cliffs on baffin island , such as polar sun spire in the sam ford fjord , or others in remote areas of greenland may be higher above sea ra 's sajir , oman , above the arabian sea tōjinbō , sakai , fukui prefecture , japan 25 m above sea of japan qingshui cliff , xiulin , hualien , hualien county , taiwan averaging 800 m above pacific ocean world 's end , horton plains , nuwara eliya , sri lanka & nbsp ; 266–267 other notable cliffs include : mount asgard , baffin island , canada ; vertical drop of about 1,200 & nbsp ; m ( 4,000 & nbsp ; ft ) because of their near-unique geological formation , the range has an extraordinarily high percentage of cliff faces making up its length , particularly along the highest portion of the range for example , a number of birds have decided affinities for choosing cliff locations for nesting , c.michael hogan

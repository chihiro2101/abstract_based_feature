cliff comes from the old english word clif of essentially the same meaning , cognate with dutch , low german , and old norse klif 'cliff' for example , given a truly vertical rock wall above a very steep slope , one could count just the rock wall or the combination for example , an 8,000 m drop over a 4,250 m span can be found at a ridge sitting inside the kermadec trench the highest very steep non-vertical cliffs in the world are nanga parbat 's rupal face and gyala peri 's southeast face , which both rise approximately 4,600 m , or 15,000 ft , above their base according to other sources , the highest cliff in the world , about 1,340 m high , is the east face of great trango in the karakoram mountains of northern pakistan this uses a fairly stringent notion of cliff , as the 1,340 m figure refers to a nearly vertical headwall of two stacked pillars ; adding in a very steep approach brings the total drop from the east face precipice to the nearby dunge glacier to nearly 2,000 m the location of the world 's highest sea cliffs depends also on the definition of 'cliff ' that is used a more vertical drop into the sea can be found at maujit qaqarssuasia ( also known as the 'thumbnail ' ) which is situated in the torssukátak fjord area at the very tip of south greenland and drops 1,560 m near-vertically however , other cliffs on baffin island , such as polar sun spire in the sam ford fjord , or others in remote areas of greenland may be higher above sea ra 's sajir , oman , above the arabian sea tōjinbō , sakai , fukui prefecture , japan 25 m above sea of japan qingshui cliff , xiulin , hualien , hualien county , taiwan averaging 800 m above pacific ocean trango towers : east face great trango tower , baltoro muztagh , gilgit–baltistan , pakistan , 1,340 m ( near vertical headwall ) , 2,100 m ( very steep overall drop from east summit to dunge glacier ) the possible contenders include ( measurements are approximate ) : mount thor , baffin island , canada ; 1,370 & nbsp ; m ( 4,500 & nbsp ; ft ) total ; top 480 & nbsp ; m ( 1600 & nbsp ; ft ) is overhanging the sheer north face of polar sun spire , in the §74 : mtatofa of baffin island , rises 4,300 & nbsp ; ft above the flat frozen fjord , although the lower portion of the face breaks from the vertical wall with a series of ledges and buttresses other notable cliffs include the trojan wall , cleft peak , injisuthi triplets , cathedral peak , monk 's cowl , mnweni buttress , etc

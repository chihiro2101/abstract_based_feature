wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out activities include underwater diving , sailing , sea rescue operations , surfing , river rafting , whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances , endurance swimming file : decompression dive-preparation.jpg alt two scuba divers in one-piece wetsuits and full scuba gear sitting in a boat , preparing to dive unlike triathlons , which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature ( the standard is at the surface or up to for unofficial events still water ( without currents or convection ) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion , approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit however at a depth of about of water , the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50 % , allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves foamed neoprene is very buoyant , helping swimmers to stay afloat , and for this reason divers need to carry extra weight based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral buoyancy near the surface together , these features greatly reduce the amount of water moving through the suit as the wearer moves in the water any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss , but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit early suits marketed as '' semi-dry '' suits came come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces , made of 'long johns ' and a separate 'jacket ' even more versatile is the heated neoprene vest that functions the same as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution flushing with cold water is prevented by the constant outflow of heating water in 1952 , uc berkeley and subsequent uc san diego sio physicist hugh bradner , who is considered to be the original inventor and '' father of the modern wetsuit , '' had the insight that a thin layer of trapped water could be tolerated between the suit fabric and the skin , so long as insulation was present in the fabric in the form of trapped bubbles in this case , the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way bradner and bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public the united states navy also turned down bradner 's and bascom 's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater sonar after experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams , o'neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called o'neill in a san francisco garage in 1952 , later relocating to santa cruz , california in 1959 with the motto '' it 's always summer on the inside '' the pêche-sport '' isothermic '' suit invented by georges beuchat in 1953 and the uk-made siebe gorman swimsuit were both made out of sponge rubber the heinke dolphin suit of the same period , also made in england , came in a green male and a white female version , both manufactured from natural rubber lined with stockinet as early as july 1951 , spearfishing in australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit '' of a 'wrap on ' variety , which does not set out to be 100 % waterproof ( but it is claimed that ) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours by may 1953 , the bondi underwater equipment manufacturer undersee products was already distributing this singlet-like design commercially to australian sporting goods stores , where it was described thus : '' made from heavy sheet rubber , the sealskin suit is most effective when worn over a football jersey this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility a small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck , wrists , and ankles in 1960 , the british dunlop sports company brought out its yellow aquafort neoprene wetsuit , whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety in this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers , greatly increasing the tear-resistance this meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit when nylon-backed neoprene appeared , the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved , but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams with this technology , the suit could be sewn and then taped , and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes to avoid this problem o'neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape initially , suits could be found as being sewn only , glued only , taped only , then also sewn and taped , or glued and taped , or perhaps all three the curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene , and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam blindstitch seams also lay flat , butting up the edge of one sheet against another , allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin for these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together , with other methods now used mainly for decorative or fashion purposes highly elastic fabrics such as spandex have mostly replaced plain nylon backing , since the nylon by itself can not be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff incorporating lycra into the backing permits a large amount of stretching that does not damage the suit , and allowed suits to become closer fitting after the development of double-backed neoprene , singled-backed neoprene still had its uses for various specific purposes for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves the strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin a long john , johnny , johnny suit , or farmer john/jane ( depending on the gender the suit is designed for ) covers the torso and legs only ; it resembles a bib overall , hence the nickname foam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell , in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene in many water sports such as scuba diving , surfing , kayaking , windsurfing , sailing and even fishing , bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would divers in warm water who do not wear a diving suit sometimes wear bootees so they can wear bigger fins for surfing , windsurfing , kitesurfing and similar sports , bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30 % of the volume , and therefore 30 % of surface buoyancy , is lost in about the first 10 & nbsp ; m , another 30 % by about 60 & nbsp ; m , and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65 % loss by about 100 & nbsp ; m

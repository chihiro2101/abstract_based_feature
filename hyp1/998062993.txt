wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out activities include underwater diving , sailing , sea rescue operations , surfing , river rafting , whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances , endurance swimming file : decompression dive-preparation.jpg alt two scuba divers in one-piece wetsuits and full scuba gear sitting in a boat , preparing to dive unlike triathlons , which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature ( the standard is at the surface or up to for unofficial events ) , most open water swim races either do not permit the use of wetsuits , ( usually defined as anything covering the body above the waist or below the knees ) , or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards still water ( without currents or convection ) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion , approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , which produces about twice the heat loss of still air , or one-tenth the loss of water however at a depth of about of water , the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50 % , allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety foamed neoprene is very buoyant , helping swimmers to stay afloat , and for this reason divers need to carry extra weight based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral buoyancy near the surface however , the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth non-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 and 0.45 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 depending on type , not very different from water – buoyancy is also reduced by compression , and scuba divers can correct this by inflating the buoyancy compensator the wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and is not '' flushed '' out by colder water entering from the outside environment , so the wearer remains warm any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss , but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit early suits marketed as '' semi-dry '' suits came come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces , made of 'long johns ' and a separate 'jacket ' electrically heated wetsuits are also available on the market these suits have special heating panels integrated in the back of the wetsuit the power for heating comes from batteries also integrated into the wetsuit even more versatile is the heated neoprene vest that functions the same as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water , particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution in this case , the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way in the popular mind , the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation , but bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric neoprene was not the only material used in early wetsuits , particularly in europe and australia the heinke dolphin suit of the same period , also made in england , came in a green male and a white female version , both manufactured from natural rubber lined with stockinet '' '' cold water suits '' , spearfishing news july 1951 , p the seaskin suit provides both underwater insulation and above-water wind protection this type of suit required care while pulling it on because the foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility a small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck , wrists , and ankles in 1960 , the british dunlop sports company brought out its yellow aquafort neoprene wetsuit , whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety dunlop sports company limited ( 1960 ) '' the aquafort wetsuit '' , triton vol the first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together in a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons , the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit when nylon-backed neoprene appeared , the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved , but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams many 1960s and 1970s wetsuits were black with visible yellow seam taping a blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle , which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing , crosses the glue line , and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene highly elastic fabrics such as spandex have mostly replaced plain nylon backing , since the nylon by itself can not be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff after the development of double-backed neoprene , singled-backed neoprene still had its uses for various specific purposes for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves some suits are arranged in two parts ; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions this fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of weight and colour , and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile , or thicker and stronger and less stretchy full body suits may have a vertical back zipper , a cross-shoulder zipper or a vertical front zipper usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet , hands or head , and the diver must wear separate neoprene boots , gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection thumb wetsuit boots are worn for various purposes , and may be worn with or without a wetsuit measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30 % of the volume , and therefore 30 % of surface buoyancy , is lost in about the first 10 & nbsp ; m , another 30 % by about 60 & nbsp ; m , and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65 % loss by about 100 & nbsp ; m

wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out activities include underwater diving , sailing , sea rescue operations , surfing , river rafting , whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances , endurance swimming file : decompression dive-preparation.jpg alt two scuba divers in one-piece wetsuits and full scuba gear sitting in a boat , preparing to dive ) , most open water swim races either do not permit the use of wetsuits , ( usually defined as anything covering the body above the waist or below the knees ) , or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards still water ( without currents or convection ) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion , approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , which produces about twice the heat loss of still air , or one-tenth the loss of water however at a depth of about of water , the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50 % , allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist , neck and ankles and also usually featuring a waterproof dry-zip together , these features greatly reduce the amount of water moving through the suit as the wearer moves in the water the wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and is not '' flushed '' out by colder water entering from the outside environment , so the wearer remains warm they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit almost all modern semi-dry suits are one piece suits with even more versatile is the heated neoprene vest that functions the same as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water , particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution they attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design , but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a flight suit after experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams , o'neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called o'neill in a san francisco garage in 1952 , later relocating to santa cruz , california in 1959 with the motto '' it 's always summer on the inside '' bob and bill meistrell , from manhattan beach , california , also started experimenting with neoprene around 1953 the pêche-sport '' isothermic '' suit invented by georges beuchat in 1953 and the uk-made siebe gorman swimsuit were both made out of sponge rubber '' '' cold water suits '' , spearfishing news july 1951 , p when jersey becomes wet , rubber holds it firmly against body and thus warmth is generated originally , wetsuits were made only with sheets of foam-rubber or neoprene that did not have any backing material this type of suit required care while pulling it on because the foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility a small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck , wrists , and ankles in 1960 , the british dunlop sports company brought out its yellow aquafort neoprene wetsuit , whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety dunlop sports company limited ( 1960 ) '' the aquafort wetsuit '' , triton vol this change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits and although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together , it could also act as a perforated tear edge , making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off when nylon-backed neoprene appeared , the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved , but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams with this technology , the suit could be sewn and then taped , and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes most early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand , which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting the curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene , and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam blindstitch seams also lay flat , butting up the edge of one sheet against another , allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin for these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together , with other methods now used mainly for decorative or fashion purposes but since the strip is very narrow , it does not drag on the skin of the wearer and thus makes the suit easy to put on and remove as wetsuit manufacturers continued to develop suit designs , they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized this has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear , and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber in the early 1970s gul wetsuits pioneered the one-piece wetsuit named as the steamer one-piece wetsuits are still sometimes referred to as 'steamers' some triathlon wetsuits go further , and use rubber-molding and texturing methods to roughen up the surface of the suit on the forearms , to increase forward drag and help pull the swimmer forwards through the water wetsuits used for caving are often single-backed with a textured surface known as '' sharkskin '' which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded in the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar , but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate ; it may be above or below the standard of 5–6 & nbsp ; mm of neoprene an average person has a surface area of about 2 & nbsp ; m 2 , so the uncompressed volume of a full one piece 6 & nbsp ; mm thick wetsuit will be in the order of 1.75 x 0.006 0.0105 & nbsp ; m 3 , or roughly 10 litres

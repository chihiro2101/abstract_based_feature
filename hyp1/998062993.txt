wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out activities include underwater diving , sailing , sea rescue operations , surfing , river rafting , whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances , endurance swimming file : decompression dive-preparation.jpg alt two scuba divers in one-piece wetsuits and full scuba gear sitting in a boat , preparing to dive unlike triathlons , which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature ( the standard is at the surface or up to for unofficial events ) , most open water swim races either do not permit the use of wetsuits , ( usually defined as anything covering the body above the waist or below the knees ) , or put wetsuit-clad swimmers in a separate category and/or make them ineligible for race awards still water ( without currents or convection ) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion , approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist , neck and ankles and also usually featuring a waterproof dry-zip the wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and is not '' flushed '' out by colder water entering from the outside environment , so the wearer remains warm the trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit 's insulating ability any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss , but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals though more expensive and more difficult to take on and off than a wetsuit ( in most cases , a helper will be needed to close the dry-zip , which is usually located across the shoulders ) , semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits , and in the case of scuba diving , require no additional skills to use they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water , particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution flushing with cold water is prevented by the constant outflow of heating water in this case , the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way in the popular mind , the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation , but bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric however , it was willard bascom , an engineer at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla , california , who suggested neoprene as a feasible material to bradner bradner and bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public jack o'neill started using closed-cell neoprene foam which was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend , harry hind , who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work after experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams , o'neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called o'neill in a san francisco garage in 1952 , later relocating to santa cruz , california in 1959 with the motto '' it 's always summer on the inside '' '' '' cold water suits '' , spearfishing news july 1951 , p water circulation automatically stops and body warmth builds up in moisture-laden jersey . development of suit design this type of suit required care while pulling it on because the foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon cloth applied to one side of the neoprene this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility a small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck , wrists , and ankles the first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together in a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons , the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit the tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a chemical solvent or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene with this technology , the suit could be sewn and then taped , and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes when colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing , taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide , jagged , black , and ugly , and was hidden within the suit and out of sight to avoid this problem o'neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape initially , suits could be found as being sewn only , glued only , taped only , then also sewn and taped , or glued and taped , or perhaps all three a blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle , which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing , crosses the glue line , and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene the curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene , and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam highly elastic fabrics such as spandex have mostly replaced plain nylon backing , since the nylon by itself can not be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff its name was given because of the steam given off from the suit once taken off allowing heat and water held inside to escape in recent years , manufacturers have experimented by combining various materials with neoprene for additional warmth or flexibility of their suits foam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell , in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles , but they also provide leakage points for water usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet , hands or head , and the diver must wear separate neoprene boots , gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection thumb wetsuit boots are worn for various purposes , and may be worn with or without a wetsuit measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30 % of the volume , and therefore 30 % of surface buoyancy , is lost in about the first 10 & nbsp ; m , another 30 % by about 60 & nbsp ; m , and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65 % loss by about 100 & nbsp ; m

wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out activities include underwater diving , sailing , sea rescue operations , surfing , river rafting , whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances , endurance swimming both divers are wearing tech rigs with back inflation bc and sling cylinders for decompression gas scuba divers in steamer wetsuits , one wearing a hood file : wetsuit.jpg alt kitesurfer wearing one-piece wetsuit , hanging from harness , separated from board unlike triathlons , which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature ( the standard is at the surface or up to for unofficial events water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , which produces about twice the heat loss of still air , or one-tenth the loss of water however at a depth of about of water , the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50 % , allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist , neck and ankles and also usually featuring a waterproof dry-zip the trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit 's insulating ability any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss , but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals though more expensive and more difficult to take on and off than a wetsuit ( in most cases , a helper will be needed to close the dry-zip , which is usually located across the shoulders ) , semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits , and in the case of scuba diving , require no additional skills to use they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit early suits marketed as '' semi-dry '' suits came come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces , made of 'long johns ' and a separate 'jacket ' even more versatile is the heated neoprene vest that functions the same as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water , particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution flushing with cold water is prevented by the constant outflow of heating water in this case , the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way they attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design , but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a flight suit as early as july 1951 , spearfishing in australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit '' of a 'wrap on ' variety , which does not set out to be 100 % waterproof ( but it is claimed that ) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours '' '' in this suit you can spearfish all winter '' , spearfishing news vol this type of suit required care while pulling it on because the foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin this was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver 's body with talc to help the rubber slide on more easily this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility in this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers , greatly increasing the tear-resistance an external layer also meant that decorative colors , logos , and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes the first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together when nylon-backed neoprene appeared , the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved , but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams the tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid waterproof rubber backing with this technology , the suit could be sewn and then taped , and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes most early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand , which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting if the cut edges did not align correctly or the gluing was not done well , there might still be water leakage along the seam for these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together , with other methods now used mainly for decorative or fashion purposes for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves although double-backed neoprene is strong , the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of drag in the water , slowing down the swimmer with the advances of elastic lycra backings and blindstitching , single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s other developments in single-backed wetsuits include the suits designed for free-diving and spearfishing to achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit , they are unlined inside , and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit wetsuits used for caving are often single-backed with a textured surface known as '' sharkskin '' which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded typically , two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14 & nbsp ; mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7 & nbsp ; mm for the limbs zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles , but they also provide leakage points for water each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages : the front zipper is easy to operate , but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance , and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate ; it may be above or below the standard of 5–6 & nbsp ; mm of neoprene typically , this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible for surfing , windsurfing , kitesurfing and similar sports , bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet wetsuit gloves are also commonly worn with dry suits

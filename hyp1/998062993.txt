wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water , or frequently doused with heavy spray , often approaching from near-horizontal directions , where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out activities include underwater diving , sailing , sea rescue operations , surfing , river rafting , whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances , endurance swimming file : decompression dive-preparation.jpg alt two scuba divers in one-piece wetsuits and full scuba gear sitting in a boat , preparing to dive both divers are

hanging from harness , separated from board unlike triathlons , which allow swimmers to wear wetsuits when the water is below a certain temperature ( the standard is at the surface or up to for unofficial events still water ( without currents or convection ) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion , approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , so an unprotected person can succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene , a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as wetsuit material ( neoprene may also be manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important ) the result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction , which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas , thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body ( or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit ) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 & nbsp ; wm −1 k −1 , which produces about twice the heat loss of still air , or one-tenth the loss of water however at a depth of about of water , the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50 % , allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface a wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed ; too loose a fit , particularly at the openings ( wrists , ankles , neck and overlaps ) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves the elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes , but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety foamed neoprene is very buoyant , helping swimmers to stay afloat , and for this reason divers need to carry extra weight based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral buoyancy near the surface semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist , neck and ankles and also usually featuring a waterproof dry-zip the trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit 's insulating ability any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss , but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals they are usually made from thick neoprene ( typically 6mm or more ) , which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth , but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the neoprene compress at depth , like a normal wetsuit early suits marketed as '' semi-dry '' suits came come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces , made of 'long johns ' and a separate 'jacket ' these suits have special heating panels integrated in the back of the wetsuit wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water , particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution in this case , the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way the united states navy also turned down bradner 's and bascom 's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater sonar jack o'neill started using closed-cell neoprene foam which was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend , harry hind , who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work as early as july 1951 , spearfishing in australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit '' of a 'wrap on ' variety , which does not set out to be 100 % waterproof ( but it is claimed that ) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours '' '' cold water suits '' , spearfishing news july 1951 , p this was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver 's body with talc to help the rubber slide on more easily backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon cloth applied to one side of the neoprene this allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit , but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff , limiting flexibility in 1960 , the british dunlop sports company brought out its yellow aquafort neoprene wetsuit , whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety an external layer also meant that decorative colors , logos , and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes this change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits the first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together in a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons , the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit the second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn this meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit with this technology , the suit could be sewn and then taped , and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes when colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing , taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide , jagged , black , and ugly , and was hidden within the suit and out of sight initially , suits could be found as being sewn only , glued only , taped only , then also sewn and taped , or glued and taped , or perhaps all three the curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene , and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam for example , a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg , neck , and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person 's body moves the strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin as wetsuit manufacturers continued to develop suit designs , they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized the animal skin eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting ( a technique e.j foam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell , in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages : the front zipper is easy to operate , but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance , and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining , to help hold the zip closed , and to keep foreign objects out measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30 % of the volume , and therefore 30 % of surface buoyancy , is lost in about the first 10 & nbsp ; m , another 30 % by about 60 & nbsp ; m , and the volume appears to stabilise at about 65 % loss by about 100 & nbsp ; m

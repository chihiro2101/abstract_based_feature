palatine ( 1574–1610 ) , frederick was the hereditary ruler of the palatinate frederick was born on 26 august 1596 at the ( a hunting lodge ) near amberg in the upper palatinate his father , frederick iv , was the ruler of electoral palatinate ; his mother was louise juliana of nassau , the daughter of william i of orange and charlotte of bourbon frederick was related to almost all of the ruling families of the holy roman empire and a number of diplomats and dignitaries attended his baptism at amberg on 6 october 1596 the capital of the palatinate , heidelberg , was suffering from an outbreak of bubonic plague at this time , so frederick spent his first two years in the upper palatinate before being brought to heidelberg in 1598 during his time at sedan , frederick was a frequent visitor to the court of henry iv of france these views are likely to have shaped frederick 's future policies on 19 september 1610 , frederick 's father , frederick iv , died from '' extravagant living '' ; his son being 14 years old at the time under the terms of the golden bull of 1356 , frederick 's closest male relative would serve as his guardian and as regent of the palatinate until frederick reached the age of majority however , his nearest male relative , wolfgang william , count palatine of neuburg , was a catholic , so , shortly before his death , frederick iv had named another wittelsbach , john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , as his son 's guardian this led to a heated dispute among the princes of the holy roman empire frederick iv 's marriage policy had been designed to solidify the palatinate 's position within the reformed camp in europe in keeping with his father 's policy , frederick v sought a marriage to elizabeth stuart , daughter of james vi of scotland and i of england frederick 's advisors in the palatinate were worried that if elizabeth were married to a catholic prince , this would upset the confessional balance of europe , and they were thus resolved that she should marry frederick v lomas , elizabeth , electress palatine and queen of bohemia , 2nd edn ( methuen & company , 1909 ) frederick and elizabeth , who had previously corresponded in french , now met each other for the first time , and got on well together the event was celebrated in john donne poetic masterpiece epithalamion , or mariage song on the lady elizabeth , and count palatine being married on st the couple entered heidelberg on 12 june 1613 , amidst widespread celebration elizabeth was popular with frederick 's subjects , and this popularity grew when , on 1 january 1614 , she gave birth to a son , frederick henry as part of the marriage negotiations , frederick had agreed to expand heidelberg castle these renovations were completed in 1615 and the '' elizabeth entrance '' to heidelberg castle was dedicated in addition to the renovations to heidelberg castle mentioned above , he commissioned a courtyard garden , the hortus palatinus , designed by english gardener inigo jones and french engineer salomon de caus furthermore , the twelve years ' truce , a hiatus in the eighty years ' war , was set to expire in 1621 , and was likely to lead to renewed fighting between the dutch republic and the spanish empire unlike many principalities of the holy roman empire , the electoral palatinate was not a solid dominion , but instead consisted of two unconnected provinces surrounded by foreign lands the lower palatinate centred on heidelberg , while the upper palatinate centred on amberg the lower palatinate 's economy was dominated by agriculture , while the upper palatinate was a mining region with one of the most successful economies in europe king of bohemia , 1619–20 the kingdom of bohemia was an elective monarchy , and despite being a kingdom , was a part of the holy roman empire in the early seventeenth century , however , bohemia faced a political crisis rudolf had waged the long war against the ottoman empire from 1593 to 1606 to gain bohemian support , rudolf agreed to guarantee bohemia 's religious liberty , issuing his so-called letter of majesty in 1609 the bohemian estates elected the habsburg matthias as rudolf 's heir , and matthias became king of bohemia in 1611 and emperor in 1612 strategists in the palatinate believed that if frederick became king , this would lead john george i , elector of saxony , to break his alliance with the habsburgs and come fully to the protestant cause image : christian i anhalt bernburg.jpg thumb left frederick 's chancellor christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg ( 1568–1630 ) in these circumstances christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , frederick v 's governor of the upper palatinate , moved to intervene in bohemia frederick did not publicly break with the emperor , but in a letter to his father-in-law , james i of england , he placed the blame for the bohemian vote on the jesuits and the spanish party at the habsburg court the first mention in prague of frederick 's name as a possible candidate as king of bohemia came in november 1618 palatine diplomat christoph von dohna approached james i of england with the possibility of frederick becoming king , but james reacted negatively to this idea although his successor , the future emperor ferdinand ii , had previously been crowned king of bohemia , the estates of bohemia now refused to recognise him as their king in august 1619 , the general parliament of all the bohemian lands declared that ferdinand had forfeited the bohemian throne 146m the preferred candidate of bohemians as their new king was the elector of saxony , but he let it be known he would not accept the throne this left frederick as the most senior protestant prince available , since no one else was willing to risk conflict with the emperor in august 1619 , the chances of frederick becoming king of bohemia became greater when gabriel bethlen launched an anti-habsburg revolt in royal hungary 134 two days later , ferdinand ii was elected holy roman emperor the electoral college also condemned the bohemian confederation 's attempt to remove ferdinand from the throne of bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the estates of bohemia , making ferdinand king of bohemia , was binding there also seems to have been economic considerations ; the upper palatinate was at that time europe 's center for iron production , while bohemia was a focal point for the tin and glass trade christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , told frederick that a union of the two areas could be commercially advantageous on 12 september 1619 , the protestant union met at rothenburg ob der tauber and called on frederick not to intervene in bohemian affairs together , they then travelled through cheb , sokolov , žatec , louny , and slaný scultetus ' iconoclasm was deeply unpopular , and frederick attempted to distance himself from it , claiming that his orders were not being carried out by his followers those who did attend half-heartedly promised to secure frederick 's rhineland territories during frederick 's absence in bohemia this meeting , which included john george of saxony and maximilian of bavaria , rejected frederick 's argument , finding that bohemia was an indivisible part of the empire the day before , king frederick had ridden down the lines and exhorted the soldiers frederick survived the accident , but his eldest son , the fifteen-year-old frederick henry of the palatinate , did not left in february 1632 , frederick met gustavus adolphus at frankfurt , with gustavus adolphus paying frederick full royal honours frederick refused gustavus adolphus ' conditions and they parted , with frederick travelling to swedish-occupied mainz , intending to return to the hague on 9 june 1635 , with spanish troops approaching , ludwig philipp of pfalz-simmern-kaiserslautern fled to kaiserslautern with frederick 's body a declaration of the cavses , for the which ,

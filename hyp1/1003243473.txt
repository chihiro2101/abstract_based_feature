his son being 14 years old at the time however , his nearest male relative , wolfgang william , count palatine of neuburg , was a catholic , so , shortly before his death , frederick iv had named another wittelsbach , john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , as his son 's guardian frederick v welcomed john to heidelberg , whereas wolfgang william was denied entry in 1613 , matthias , holy roman emperor intervened in the dispute , with the result being that frederick v was able to begin his personal rule in the palatinate even though he was still underage frederick iv 's marriage policy had been designed to solidify the palatinate 's position within the reformed camp in europe frederick iv had hoped that his daughter katharina would marry the future gustavus adolphus of sweden , although this never came to pass image : elisabeth stuart winterkoenigin 1613 von anonymus.jpg thumb right 200px elizabeth stuart ( 1596–1662 ) , 1613 frederick 's advisors in the palatinate were worried that if elizabeth were married to a catholic prince , this would upset the confessional balance of europe , and they were thus resolved that she should marry frederick v hans meinhard von schönberg , who had served as frederick v 's hofmeister since his return to heidelberg , was sent to london to court the princess in spring 1612 lomas , elizabeth , electress palatine and queen of bohemia , 2nd edn ( methuen & company , 1909 ) the event was celebrated in john donne poetic masterpiece epithalamion , or mariage song on the lady elizabeth , and count palatine being married on st the couple entered heidelberg on 12 june 1613 , amidst widespread celebration elizabeth was popular with frederick 's subjects , and this popularity grew when , on 1 january 1614 , she gave birth to a son , frederick henry frederick undertook a large building campaign , designed to glorify his regime politically , frederick positioned himself as a leader of the protestant princes in the holy roman empire , and as a defender of the liberty of the german nobles against the catholic matthias , holy roman emperor unlike many principalities of the holy roman empire , the electoral palatinate was not a solid dominion , but instead consisted of two unconnected provinces surrounded by foreign lands the kingdom of bohemia was an elective monarchy , and despite being a kingdom , was a part of the holy roman empire since 1526 , the kings of bohemia had all been members of the house of habsburg ; since 1555 , these kings had also been emperors the estates of the realm of bohemia became worried that the habsburgs were planning to transform bohemia into an absolute monarchy a large number of bohemian nobles were protestant and feared that a catholic emperor would attempt to impose catholicism on bohemia to gain bohemian support , rudolf agreed to guarantee bohemia 's religious liberty , issuing his so-called letter of majesty in 1609 image : christian i anhalt bernburg.jpg thumb left frederick 's chancellor christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg ( 1568–1630 ) in 1617 , matthias prevailed on the bohemian estates to elect the habsburg ferdinand , duke of styria , as heir to the throne of bohemia ferdinand was an intensely loyal catholic , and many protestant noblemen believed that ferdinand intended to withdraw the protections of rudolf ii 's letter of majesty the protestants claimed the status of these lands fell under the term '' royal land '' , and thus were subject to bohemia 's authority by the letter of majesty – a very disputed legal interpretation which the habsburg government rejected at any rate , frederick was not initially eager to defy the emperor , who had praised frederick 's loyalty the first mention in prague of frederick 's name as a possible candidate as king of bohemia came in november 1618 palatine diplomat christoph von dohna approached james i of england with the possibility of frederick becoming king , but james reacted negatively to this idea the princes of the protestant union similarly rejected the idea , fearing it might lead to religious war and the elector of saxony was staunchly opposed behind the scenes , frederick authorised sending a force under count ernst von mansfeld to support the bohemian rebels in august 1618 , forces under mansfeld entered bohemia and led the siege of pilsen , which saw pilsen fall to rebel forces on 21 november 1618 , leaving the entire kingdom in protestant hands image : justus sustermans 028.jpg thumb right ferdinand ii , holy roman emperor ( 1578–1637 ) , who was elected king of bohemia in 1617 and who would later claim that frederick had usurped his rightful claim to the throne of bohemia although his successor , the future emperor ferdinand ii , had previously been crowned king of bohemia , the estates of bohemia now refused to recognise him as their king in august 1619 , the general parliament of all the bohemian lands declared that ferdinand had forfeited the bohemian throne in august 1619 , the chances of frederick becoming king of bohemia became greater when gabriel bethlen launched an anti-habsburg revolt in royal hungary on 26 august 1619 , the states of the bohemian confederacy elected frederick as the new king of bohemia , frederick receiving news of his election on 29 august in amberg the electoral college also condemned the bohemian confederation 's attempt to remove ferdinand from the throne of bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the estates of bohemia , making ferdinand king of bohemia , was binding left frederick 's decision to accept the bohemian crown has been the subject of much historical speculation later catholic propaganda , in a view accepted by friedrich schiller , portrayed the decision as based mainly on elizabeth stuart 's desire to be a queen friedrich schiller : geschichte des 30jährigen kriegs , teil 1 more recently , historians have concluded that frederick 's decision was based primarily on a sense of duty to his fellow protestants , although frederick wavered between his obligations to the emperor and his commitment to his religious brethren there also seems to have been economic considerations ; the upper palatinate was at that time europe 's center for iron production , while bohemia was a focal point for the tin and glass trade between 24 september and 28 , frederick reached his decision '' not to resist the will of the almighty '' and thus decided to accept the bohemian crown image : winterkönig friedrich von böhmen.jpg thumb right 200px coronation of frederick v in st the litany was sung – per the catholic tradition – rather than spoken as was normally done by the calvinists in the third week of august , they shifted their focus and marched into the nearly unarmed electoral palatinate , occupying mainz maximilian took prague shortly after frederick 's departure in summer 1621 , john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , frederick 's former guardian who had served as regent of the electoral palatinate when frederick left for prague , resigned with frederick 's knowledge , mansfeld raided darmstadt and captured louis v , landgrave of hesse-darmstadt and his son johann as hostages left in february 1632 , frederick met gustavus adolphus at frankfurt , with gustavus adolphus paying frederick full royal honours upon frederick 's pressing his case with gustavus adolphus , gustavus adolphus told frederick that he would accept frederick 's restoration without dutch/british support only if frederick would agree to hold the palatinate as a fief of the king of sweden it is believed that ludwig philipp of pfalz-simmern-kaiserslautern transferred frederick 's body to the sedan in september 1637 , but frederick 's final resting place is unknown

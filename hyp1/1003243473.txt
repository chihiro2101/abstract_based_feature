his mother was louise juliana of nassau , the daughter of william i of orange and charlotte of bourbon frederick was related to almost all of the ruling families of the holy roman empire and a number of diplomats and dignitaries attended his baptism at amberg on 6 october 1596 c-b 011.jpg thumb left 200px portrait of frederick by michiel jansz on 19 september 1610 , frederick 's father , frederick iv , died from '' extravagant living '' ; his son being 14 years old at the time however , his nearest male relative , wolfgang william , count palatine of neuburg , was a catholic , so , shortly before his death , frederick iv had named another wittelsbach , john ii , count palatine of zweibrücken , as his son 's guardian this led to a heated dispute among the princes of the holy roman empire the dispute ended in 1614 , when frederick attained his eighteenth birthday james had initially considered marrying elizabeth to louis xiii of france , but these plans were rejected by his advisors frederick 's advisors in the palatinate were worried that if elizabeth were married to a catholic prince , this would upset the confessional balance of europe , and they were thus resolved that she should marry frederick v frederick travelled to london to collect his bride , landing on english soil on 16 october 1612 shortly before the ceremony , frederick was inducted into the order of the garter and he wore the order 's chain during the wedding ceremony the couple entered heidelberg on 12 june 1613 , amidst widespread celebration elizabeth was popular with frederick 's subjects , and this popularity grew when , on 1 january 1614 , she gave birth to a son , frederick henry as part of the marriage negotiations , frederick had agreed to expand heidelberg castle frederick undertook a large building campaign , designed to glorify his regime politically , frederick positioned himself as a leader of the protestant princes in the holy roman empire , and as a defender of the liberty of the german nobles against the catholic matthias , holy roman emperor the conflicts between princes of these three faiths developed into a deep struggle over the empire 's constitution furthermore , the twelve years ' truce , a hiatus in the eighty years ' war , was set to expire in 1621 , and was likely to lead to renewed fighting between the dutch republic and the spanish empire the lower palatinate centred on heidelberg , while the upper palatinate centred on amberg king of bohemia , 1619–20 the kingdom of bohemia was an elective monarchy , and despite being a kingdom , was a part of the holy roman empire since 1526 , the kings of bohemia had all been members of the house of habsburg ; since 1555 , these kings had also been emperors in the early seventeenth century , however , bohemia faced a political crisis the estates of the realm of bohemia became worried that the habsburgs were planning to transform bohemia into an absolute monarchy a large number of bohemian nobles were protestant and feared that a catholic emperor would attempt to impose catholicism on bohemia thus , a substantial opposition movement developed to the rule of emperor rudolf ii dissatisfied with the outcome , rudolf sought to launch a new war against the ottomans to gain bohemian support , rudolf agreed to guarantee bohemia 's religious liberty , issuing his so-called letter of majesty in 1609 still , the bohemian nobles remained suspicious of rudolf and in contact with the protestant union yet in the latter year there was discussion within the protestant union about fielding a protestant candidate to supplant matthias as king of bohemia , and frederick 's name was discussed in this regard strategists in the palatinate believed that if frederick became king , this would lead john george i , elector of saxony , to break his alliance with the habsburgs and come fully to the protestant cause image : christian i anhalt bernburg.jpg thumb left frederick 's chancellor christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg ( 1568–1630 ) meanwhile , the sectarian conflicts in bohemia continued ferdinand was an intensely loyal catholic , and many protestant noblemen believed that ferdinand intended to withdraw the protections of rudolf ii 's letter of majesty these suspicions were further aroused when imperial officials ordered protestants to stop erecting protestant churches on the '' stifts '' , lands held by prince bishop who were not subject to the bohemian estates the protestants claimed the status of these lands fell under the term '' royal land '' , and thus were subject to bohemia 's authority by the letter of majesty – a very disputed legal interpretation which the habsburg government rejected on 23 may 1618 , an assembly of protestant noblemen , led by count jindřich matyáš thurn , stormed prague castle , and seized two imperial governors , vilem slavata of chlum and jaroslav borzita of martinice the rebels charged them with violating the letter of majesty , found them guilty , and threw them and their scribe philip fabricius out of the windows of the bohemian chancellery at any rate , frederick was not initially eager to defy the emperor , who had praised frederick 's loyalty frederick did not publicly break with the emperor , but in a letter to his father-in-law , james i of england , he placed the blame for the bohemian vote on the jesuits and the spanish party at the habsburg court the first mention in prague of frederick 's name as a possible candidate as king of bohemia came in november 1618 it is not known if frederick 's agents played a role in talking up his possible candidacy behind the scenes , frederick authorised sending a force under count ernst von mansfeld to support the bohemian rebels in august 1618 , forces under mansfeld entered bohemia and led the siege of pilsen , which saw pilsen fall to rebel forces on 21 november 1618 , leaving the entire kingdom in protestant hands image : justus sustermans 028.jpg thumb right ferdinand ii , holy roman emperor ( 1578–1637 ) , who was elected king of bohemia in 1617 and who would later claim that frederick had usurped his rightful claim to the throne of bohemia this formally severed all ties between bohemia and the habsburgs and made war inevitable 146m the preferred candidate of bohemians as their new king was the elector of saxony , but he let it be known he would not accept the throne on 26 august 1619 , the states of the bohemian confederacy elected frederick as the new king of bohemia , frederick receiving news of his election on 29 august in amberg frederick was the only elector who voted against ferdinand ; even the protestant prince-electors john george i of saxony and john sigismund of brandenburg adhered to the tradition of supporting the habsburg imperial candidate the electoral college also condemned the bohemian confederation 's attempt to remove ferdinand from the throne of bohemia and declared that the 1617 vote of the estates of bohemia , making ferdinand king of bohemia , was binding there also seems to have been economic considerations ; the upper palatinate was at that time europe 's center for iron production , while bohemia was a focal point for the tin and glass trade other possible allies – the dutch republic , charles emmanuel i , duke of savoy , and the republic of venice – sent letters saying they would not be able to offer frederick assistance if he accepted the bohemian offer 24 24 the dutch republic , the republic of venice , denmark , and sweden recognised frederick as king of bohemia worst of all for frederick , on 3 july 1620 , the protestant union signed the treaty of ulm ( 1620 ) , thereby withdrawing their support for frederick and declaring neutrality in the conflict between frederick and the catholic league with frederick 's knowledge , mansfeld raided darmstadt and captured louis v , landgrave of hesse-darmstadt and his son johann as hostages when oppenheim was captured in december 1631 , frederick believed the time was ripe for him to reestablish himself in the palatinate , and he left for heidelberg it is believed that ludwig philipp of pfalz-simmern-kaiserslautern transferred frederick 's body to the sedan in september 1637 , but frederick 's final resting place is unknown a declaration of the cavses , for the which , wee frederick , by the grace of god king bohemia , covnt palatine of the rhine , elector of the sacred empire , & c

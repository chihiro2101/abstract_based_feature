incursions of imperial troops from the habsburg hereditary lands the lower palatinate 's economy was dominated by agriculture , while the upper palatinate was a mining region with one of the most successful economies in europe thus , a substantial opposition movement developed to the rule of emperor rudolf ii strategists in the palatinate believed that if frederick became king , this would lead john george i , elector of saxony , to break his alliance with the habsburgs and come fully to the protestant cause image : christian i anhalt bernburg.jpg thumb left frederick 's chancellor

court the first mention in prague of frederick 's name as a possible candidate as king of bohemia came in november 1618 it is not known if frederick 's agents played a role in talking up his possible

crowned king of bohemia , the estates of bohemia now refused to recognise him as their king this formally severed all ties between bohemia and the habsburgs and made war inevitable 146m the preferred

in st frederick donned the crown of saint wenceslas in st the litany was sung – per the catholic tradition – rather than spoken as was normally done by the calvinists frederick assumed a weak crown and a state torn with internal divisions neither frederick nor his wife spoke czech , so court offices were staffed primarily with foreigners , while the administration of the localities was left to the local nobles further alienation was caused by frederick v 's court preacher , abraham scultetus , who was determined to use his new post to advance the cause of calvinism in bohemia image : chronogramm winterkönig c-l 032.jpg thumb left 200px this 1619 imperial pamphlet , containing a chronogram , was the first to dub frederick '' the winter king '' frederick 's propagandists attempted to respond to the phrase by arguing that frederick was in fact a '' winter lion '' who defended the crown of bohemia against troublemakers and liars , and that he would also be a '' summer lion this treaty provided that maximilian would be commander of the forces against frederick , promised that maximilian would retain all of the occupied bohemian lands for himself , and that he would be granted frederick 's electoral title as well john george of saxony declined to send a representative frederick argued that it would therefore be illegal for ferdinand to use imperial power against him this meeting , which included john george of saxony and maximilian of bavaria , rejected frederick 's argument , finding that bohemia was an indivisible part of the empire on 1 april 1620 , the imperial party issued an ultimatum calling on frederick to leave bohemia by 1 june a little later , john george of saxony signed a treaty with ferdinand in which ferdinand guaranteed the practice of lutheranism in bohemia and recognized the secular areas in the netherlands left in february 1632 , frederick met gustavus adolphus at frankfurt , with gustavus adolphus paying frederick full royal honours the lands of the palatinate were simply too important strategically for gustavus adolphus to hand them over to frederick

since 1555 , these kings had also been emperors the estates of the realm of bohemia became worried that the habsburgs were planning to transform bohemia into an absolute monarchy rudolf had waged the long war against the ottoman empire from 1593 to 1606 to gain bohemian support , rudolf agreed to guarantee bohemia 's religious liberty , issuing his so-called letter of majesty in 1609 the bohemian estates elected the habsburg matthias as rudolf 's heir , and matthias became king of bohemia in 1611 and emperor in 1612 strategists in the palatinate believed that if frederick became king , this would lead john george i , elector of saxony , to break his alliance with the habsburgs and come fully to the protestant cause in 1617 , matthias prevailed on the bohemian estates to elect the habsburg ferdinand , duke of styria , as heir to the throne of bohemia these suspicions were further aroused when imperial officials ordered protestants to stop erecting protestant churches on the '' stifts '' , lands held by prince bishop who were not subject to the bohemian estates this event – known as the second defenestration of prague – marked the beginning of the bohemian revolt , and with it , the beginning of the thirty years ' war in these circumstances christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , frederick v 's governor of the upper palatinate , moved to intervene in bohemia frederick did not publicly break with the emperor , but in a letter to his father-in-law , james i of england , he placed the blame for the bohemian vote on the jesuits and the spanish party at the habsburg court the princes of the protestant union similarly rejected the idea , fearing it might lead to religious war and the elector of saxony was staunchly opposed behind the scenes , frederick authorised sending a force under count ernst von mansfeld to support the bohemian rebels in august 1618 , forces under mansfeld entered bohemia and led the siege of pilsen , which saw pilsen fall to rebel forces on 21 november 1618 , leaving the entire kingdom in protestant hands in august 1619 , the general parliament of all the bohemian lands declared that ferdinand had forfeited the bohemian throne this left frederick as the most senior protestant prince available , since no one else was willing to risk conflict with the emperor on 26 august 1619 , the states of the bohemian confederacy elected frederick as the new king of bohemia , frederick receiving news of his election on 29 august in amberg frederick was the only elector who voted against ferdinand ; even the protestant prince-electors john george i of saxony and john sigismund of brandenburg adhered to the tradition of supporting the habsburg imperial candidate later catholic propaganda , in a view accepted by friedrich schiller , portrayed the decision as based mainly on elizabeth stuart 's desire to be a queen christian i , prince of anhalt-bernburg , told frederick that a union of the two areas could be commercially advantageous on 12 september 1619 , the protestant union met at rothenburg ob der tauber and called on frederick not to intervene in bohemian affairs other possible allies – the dutch republic , charles emmanuel i , duke of savoy , and the republic of venice – sent letters saying they would not be able to offer frederick assistance if he accepted the bohemian offer the nickname '' the winter king '' appeared shortly after the beginning of frederick 's reign and our first printed reference using the term came in a 1619 imperial pamphlet that presented the phrase in the context of a royal chronogram if frederick did not comply by this date , ferdinand threatened to enforce his right as holy roman emperor and rightful king of bohemia to overthrow the usurper on 21 january 1621 , ferdinand issued a decree against frederick and anhalt , accusing them of breach of peace , supporting rebels , and treason on 23 february 1623 , ferdinand ii , holy roman emperor awarded frederick 's electoral title to maximilian of bavaria , who now became maximilian i , elector of bavaria left in february 1632 , frederick met gustavus adolphus at frankfurt , with gustavus adolphus paying frederick full royal honours frederick 's son and heir , charles louis , was only 15 years old

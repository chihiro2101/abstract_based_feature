although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin it is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods ( e.g glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s there is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns , and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant for human consumption , glycerol is classified by the u.s glycerol is a component of glycerin soap this kind of soap is used by people with sensitive , easily irritated skin because it prevents skin dryness with its moisturizer properties , 5 % , as a high volume enema glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties such products are not '' alcohol-free '' in a scientific or fda regulatory sense , as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical 's constituents inert like alcohols ( i.e dehydrating glycerol affords hydroxyacetone when the body uses stored fat as a source of energy , glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream in adipose tissue , glycerol 3-phosphate is obtained from dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) with the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glycerol has very low toxicity when ingested ; its ld50 oral dose for rats is 12600 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 8700 & nbsp ; mg/kg for mice mass spectrum of glycerol cdc – niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards – glycerin ( mist )

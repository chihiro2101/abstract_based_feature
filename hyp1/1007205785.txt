although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s due to this it is used widely in wound care products , including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care it is approved for all types of wound care except third degree burns , and is used to package donor skin used in skin grafts in solid dosage forms like tablets , glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent for human consumption , glycerol is classified by the u.s this kind of soap is used by people with sensitive , easily irritated skin because it prevents skin dryness with its moisturizer properties taken orally ( often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste ) , glycerol can cause a rapid , temporary decrease in the intraocular pressure glycerol has also been incorporated as a component of bio-ink formulations in the field of bioprinting the glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein , carbohydrate , or glycoprotein molecules when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) it is also used as an '' alcohol-free '' alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions it is less extractive when utilized in a standard tincture methodology alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical 's constituents inert like alcohols ( i.e glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol , which has a lower freezing point glycerol is one of the most used additive for starch thermoplastic glycerol metabolization is reduced in both cirrhosis and fatty liver disease mass spectrum of glycerol cdc – niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards – glycerin ( mist )

although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 there is no topical treatment approved for third degree burns , and so this limitation is not exclusive to glycerin glycerol is used in medical , pharmaceutical and personal care preparations , often as a means of improving smoothness , providing lubrication , and as a humectant for human consumption , glycerol is classified by the u.s glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing glycerol is a component of glycerin soap it may be administered undiluted either as a suppository or as a small-volume ( 2â€“10 & nbsp ; ml ) enema taken orally ( often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste ) , glycerol can cause a rapid , temporary decrease in the intraocular pressure the glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein , carbohydrate , or glycoprotein molecules it is also used as an '' alcohol-free '' alternative to ethanol as a solvent in preparing herbal extractions alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties such products are not '' alcohol-free '' in a scientific or fda regulatory sense , as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites the minimum freezing point temperature is about corresponding to 70 % glycerol in water glycerol is used as fill for pressure gauges to damp vibration glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly glycerol is also used to power diesel generators supplying electricity for the fia formula e series of electric race cars when the body uses stored fat as a source of energy , glycerol and fatty acids are released into the bloodstream glycerol has very low toxicity when ingested ; its ld50 oral dose for rats is 12600 & nbsp ; mg/kg and 8700 & nbsp ; mg/kg for mice

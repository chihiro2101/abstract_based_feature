although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods it is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods ( e.g glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s ichthyosis and xerosis have been relieved by the topical use of glycerin in solid dosage forms like tablets , glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent for human consumption , glycerol is classified by the u.s glycerol is a component of glycerin soap this can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure the glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein , carbohydrate , or glycoprotein molecules alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties such products are not '' alcohol-free '' in a scientific or fda regulatory sense , as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups critical ) methodologies as opposed to standard passive '' tincturing '' methodologies that are better suited to alcohol glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical 's constituents inert like alcohols ( i.e glycerol is bacteriostatic in its action , and ethanol is bactericidal in its action ( 1928 ) glycerol and the glycols â€“ production , properties and analysis glycerol is used as fill for pressure gauges to damp vibration glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly glycerol is one of the most used additive for starch thermoplastic the cheaper diethylene glycol was relabeled as the more expensive glycerol

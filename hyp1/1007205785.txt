although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin in food and beverages , glycerol serves as a humectant , solvent , and sweetener , and may help preserve foods glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s food and drug administration ( fda ) carbohydrate designation includes all caloric macronutrients excluding protein and fat glycerin is mildly antimicrobial and antiviral and is an fda approved treatment for wounds in solid dosage forms like tablets , glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent glycerol is also used in blood banking to preserve red blood cells prior to freezing glycerol is a component of glycerin soap it may be administered undiluted either as a suppository or as a small-volume ( 2–10 & nbsp ; ml ) enema this can be useful for the initial emergency treatment of severely elevated eye pressure the glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein , carbohydrate , or glycoprotein molecules alcohol-based tinctures can also have the alcohol removed and replaced with glycerol for its preserving properties such products are not '' alcohol-free '' in a scientific or fda regulatory sense , as glycerol contains three hydroxyl groups fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites that glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic ( i.e leffingwell , georgia and lesser , miton ( 1945 ) glycerin – its industrial and commercial applications in the laboratory , glycerol is a common component of solvents for enzyme reagents stored at temperatures below 0 & nbsp ; °c due to the freezing-point depression glycerol is a precursor for synthesis of triacylglycerols and of phospholipids in the liver and adipose tissue in adipose tissue , glycerol 3-phosphate is obtained from dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) with the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in 1937 , more than one hundred people died in the united states after ingesting deg-contaminated elixir sulfanilamide , a drug used to treat infections mass spectrum of glycerol cdc – niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards – glycerin ( mist )

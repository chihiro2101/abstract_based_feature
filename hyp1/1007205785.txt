although usually not cost-effective , glycerol can be produced by various routes from propene this epichlorohydrin is then hydrolyzed to give glycerol chlorine-free processes from propylene include the synthesis of glycerol from acrolein and propylene oxide : because of the large-scale production of biodiesel from fats , where glycerol is a waste product , the market for glycerol is depressed owing to oversupply , efforts are being made to convert glycerol to synthetic precursors , such as acrolein and epichlorohydrin it is also used as filler in commercially prepared low-fat foods ( e.g glycerol and water are used to preserve certain types of plant leaves as a sugar substitute , it has approximately 27 food energy per teaspoon ( sugar has 20 ) and is 60 % as sweet as sucrose as a food additive , glycerol is labeled as e number e422 as used in foods , glycerol is categorized by the u.s due to this it is used widely in wound care products , including glycerin based hydrogel sheets for burns and other wound care in solid dosage forms like tablets , glycerol is used as a tablet holding agent for human consumption , glycerol is classified by the u.s glycerol is a component of glycerin soap it may be administered undiluted either as a suppository or as a small-volume ( 2–10 & nbsp ; ml ) enema the glycerol content acts to add viscosity to the bio-ink without adding large protein , carbohydrate , or glycoprotein molecules when utilized in '' tincture '' method extractions , specifically as a 10 % solution , glycerol prevents tannins from precipitating in ethanol extracts of plants ( tinctures ) fluid extract manufacturers often extract herbs in hot water before adding glycerol to make glycerites that glycerol possesses such high extractive power assumes it is utilized with dynamic ( i.e glycerol possesses the intrinsic property of not denaturing or rendering a botanical 's constituents inert like alcohols ( i.e ( 1928 ) glycerol and the glycols – production , properties and analysis the minimum freezing point temperature is about corresponding to 70 % glycerol in water glycerol was historically used as an anti-freeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol , which has a lower freezing point glycerol is used by the film industry when filming scenes involving water to stop areas from drying out too quickly glycerol metabolization is reduced in both cirrhosis and fatty liver disease the cheaper diethylene glycol was relabeled as the more expensive glycerol mass spectrum of glycerol cdc – niosh pocket guide to chemical hazards – glycerin ( mist )

around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) the 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages , including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of leica film instead of 36 otto berning was granted its first robot patent in 1934 ; a us patent was granted in 1936 see '' heinz kilfitt - photographic camera , 1936 ( robot camera ) '' on this page for kilfitt 's us patent of '' a photographic camera in which the feed of the film is effected automatically by a spring mechanism '' the camera was originally intended to come in two versions : robot i , without motor , and robot ii with a spring motor its release was delayed and already the first camera '' robot i '' included its hallmark spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage the rotary shutter and the film drive are like those used in cine cameras in 1938 berning introduced the robot ii , a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism among the standard lenses were a 3 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar and a 3.75 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations , a f/2.0 , 40 & nbsp ; mm zeiss biotar and f/4 , 7.5 & nbsp ; cm zeiss sonnar the film cassette system was redesigned , and the 1951 iia accepted a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette this was an electrically driven camera using large cassettes possibly as large as 300 24 x 24mm images robot royal ii is a viewfinder camera , it has no rangefinder , it does not have burst mode , it is a stripped down robot royal iii the robot royal 36 took a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm still picture but was identical to the royal 24 in all other regards while the robots were capable of sequence photography , the shutter that made this possible placed some constraints upon taking lenses and shutter speeds the maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 & nbsp ; mm , although telephotos up to 600 & nbsp ; mm were offered the standard 38 & nbsp ; mm f/2.8 xenar lenses were extremely sharp , even by today 's standards , and zone focusing worked well on rapid action with short focal length lenses otto berning made a robot camera specially for german airforce -- the robot luftwaffen eigentum

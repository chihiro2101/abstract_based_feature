around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) the 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages , including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of leica film instead of 36 its release was delayed and already the first camera '' robot i '' included its hallmark spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr the camera does not have a rangefinder , as it was designed for use mostly with short focal length lenses ( e.g 40 & nbsp ; mm ) with great depth of field a very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8 , 3.25 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar lens added 1/2 inch to the camera depth the cassettes appear to be based on the agfa memo cassette design , the now-standard kodak 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette not yet being popular in germany in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage when the camera back was shut , the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another among the standard lenses were a 3 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar and a 3.75 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations , a f/2.0 , 40 & nbsp ; mm zeiss biotar and f/4 , 7.5 & nbsp ; cm zeiss sonnar the film cassette system was redesigned , and the 1951 iia accepted a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette a small bakelite box was sold to allow colour film to be rewound into the original cassettes as required by film processing companies there are two versions , robot royal 36 , produce 36 24x36mm images on a roll of 135 film , robot royal 24 makes 50 24x24mm images on 135 film in the late 1950s the company , now called robot-berning , redesigned the robot star and created the vollautomat star ii since most robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position , robot also introduced versions without a finder , and even without rewind it became the centerpiece of the company 's portable document capture , traffic control and security solutions , and continues to be the standard robot camera for instrumentation applications a 150 & nbsp ; mm tele-xenar was available for long-distance action photography , but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 & nbsp ; mm frame

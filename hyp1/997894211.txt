around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) the 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages , including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of leica film instead of 36 its release was delayed and already the first camera '' robot i '' included its hallmark spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr 40 & nbsp ; mm ) with great depth of field a very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8 , 3.25 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar lens added 1/2 inch to the camera depth the cassettes appear to be based on the agfa memo cassette design , the now-standard kodak 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette not yet being popular in germany in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage among the standard lenses were a 3 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar and a 3.75 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations , a f/2.0 , 40 & nbsp ; mm zeiss biotar and f/4 , 7.5 & nbsp ; cm zeiss sonnar the special robot cassettes type-n continued to be used for take-up a small bakelite box was sold to allow colour film to be rewound into the original cassettes as required by film processing companies unlike the central leica 250gg camera in the ju87 , which was switched on automatically when the dive brakes were applied , the robot camera had to be switched on manually there are two versions , robot royal 36 , produce 36 24x36mm images on a roll of 135 film , robot royal 24 makes 50 24x24mm images on 135 film film could now be rewound into the feed cassette in the camera as in other 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras since most robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position , robot also introduced versions without a finder , and even without rewind the screw in lens mount was 26 & nbsp ; mm in diameter the maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 & nbsp ; mm , although telephotos up to 600 & nbsp ; mm were offered otto berning made a robot camera specially for german airforce -- the robot luftwaffen eigentum

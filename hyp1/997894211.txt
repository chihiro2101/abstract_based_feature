around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) the 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages , including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of leica film instead of 36 its release was delayed and already the first camera '' robot i '' included its hallmark spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr 40 & nbsp ; mm ) with great depth of field the robot i was quite small , the body measuring 4¼ inches long , 2½ inches high , and 1¼ inches deep a very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8 , 3.25 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar lens added 1/2 inch to the camera depth in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage in 1938 berning introduced the robot ii , a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism the film cassette system was redesigned , and the 1951 iia accepted a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette the special robot cassettes type-n continued to be used for take-up unlike the central leica 250gg camera in the ju87 , which was switched on automatically when the dive brakes were applied , the robot camera had to be switched on manually there are two versions , robot royal 36 , produce 36 24x36mm images on a roll of 135 film , robot royal 24 makes 50 24x24mm images on 135 film film could now be rewound into the feed cassette in the camera as in other 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras the robot star 25 could expose 25 frames on a single winding , and the double-motor robot star 50 could expose 50 frames in contrast , leica 's mount was almost twice as large at 39 & nbsp ; mm the maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 & nbsp ; mm , although telephotos up to 600 & nbsp ; mm were offered otto berning made a robot camera specially for german airforce -- the robot luftwaffen eigentum

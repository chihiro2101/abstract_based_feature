around 1930 heinz kilfitt , a trained watchmaker , designed a new 35 & nbsp ; mm film compact camera using a 24×24 & nbsp ; mm frame format ( instead of the leica 24×36 & nbsp ; mm or cine 18×24 & nbsp ; mm formats ) see '' heinz kilfitt - photographic camera , 1936 ( robot camera ) '' on this page for kilfitt 's us patent of '' a photographic camera in which the feed of the film is effected automatically by a spring mechanism '' the camera was originally intended to come in two versions : robot i , without motor , and robot ii with a spring motor its release was delayed and already the first camera '' robot i '' included its hallmark spring motor the first production cameras had a stainless steel body , a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second , and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second the camera used proprietary '' type k '' cartridges , not the now-standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cartridges introduced in the same year by kodak 's dr the camera does not have a rangefinder , as it was designed for use mostly with short focal length lenses ( e.g the robot i was quite small , the body measuring 4¼ inches long , 2½ inches high , and 1¼ inches deep a very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8 , 3.25 & nbsp ; cm zeiss tessar lens added 1/2 inch to the camera depth the cassettes appear to be based on the agfa memo cassette design , the now-standard kodak 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette not yet being popular in germany in place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes , the robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage when the camera back was shut , the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another in 1938 berning introduced the robot ii , a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism the film cassette system was redesigned , and the 1951 iia accepted a standard 35 & nbsp ; mm cassette civilian versions of the robot were discontinued at the outset of the second world war , but it was used as a bomb damage assessment camera by the luftwaffe , mounted in the tail of ju87 ( stuka ) dive bombers robot royal ii is a viewfinder camera , it has no rangefinder , it does not have burst mode , it is a stripped down robot royal iii film could now be rewound into the feed cassette in the camera as in other 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras the robot star 25 could expose 25 frames on a single winding , and the double-motor robot star 50 could expose 50 frames a 150 & nbsp ; mm tele-xenar was available for long-distance action photography , but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 & nbsp ; mm frame the lack of a rangefinder on the robot and robot star required zone focusing of these long lenses : every shot had to be estimated or premeasured

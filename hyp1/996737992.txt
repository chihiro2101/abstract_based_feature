q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser 's optical resonator initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium , the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly ; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity an additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity and can be used for something else when the q is raised , lasing builds up from the initial seed , producing a q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed the material may be an ion-doped crystal like cr-yag , which is used for q-switching of nd-yag laser , a bleachable dye , or a passive semiconductor device initially , the loss of the absorber is high , but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium after the pulse , the absorber recovers to its high-loss state before the gain recovers , so that the next pulse is delayed until the energy in the gain medium is fully replenished direct control of the repetition rate can be achieved by using a pulsed pump source as well as passive q-switching the cavity q goes from low to high to start the laser buildup , and then goes from high to low to '' dump '' the beam from the cavity all at once pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium however , q-switched lasers can also be used for measurement purposes , such as for distance measurements ( range finding ) by measuring the time it takes for the pulse to get to some target and the reflected light to get back to the sender

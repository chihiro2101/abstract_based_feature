q-switching is achieved by putting some type of variable attenuator inside the laser 's optical resonator initially the laser medium is pumped while the q-switch is set to prevent feedback of light into the gain medium ( producing an optical resonator with low q ) this produces a population inversion , but laser operation can not yet occur since there is no feedback from the resonator the net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser , known as a giant pulse , which may have a very high peak intensity when the q is raised , lasing builds up from the initial seed , producing a q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed in this case , the q-switch is a saturable absorber , a material whose transmission increases when the intensity of light exceeds some threshold direct control of the repetition rate can be achieved by using a pulsed pump source as well as passive q-switching jitter can be reduced by not reducing the q by as much , so that a small amount of light can still circulate in the cavity this produces a shorter output pulse than regular q-switching pulses of light from another laser ( the '' master oscillator '' ) are injected into the cavity by lowering the q to allow the pulse to enter and then increasing the q to confine the pulse to the cavity where it can be amplified by repeated passes through the gain medium large-scale laser systems can produce q-switched pulses with energies of many joules and peak powers in the gigawatt region q-switched lasers are often used in applications which demand high laser intensities in nanosecond pulses , such as metal cutting or pulsed holography nd : yag lasers are currently the most favoured lasers due to their high peak powers , high repetition rates and relatively low costs

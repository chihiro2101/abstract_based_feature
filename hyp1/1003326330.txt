styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods ( cinnamon , coffee beans , balsam trees and peanuts ) and is also found in coal tar in 1839 , the german apothecary eduard simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin ( called storax or styrax ( latin ) ) of the american sweetgum tree ( liquidambar styraciflua ) he called the liquid '' styrol '' ( now styrene ) ( 1839 ) '' ueber den flüssigen storax ( styrax liquidus ) '' ( on liquid storax ( styrax liquidus ) , annalen der chemie , 31 : 265–277 268 : '' das flüchtige oel , für welches ich den namen styrol vorschlage , … '' ( the volatile oil , for which i suggest the name '' styrol '' , … ) for further details of the history of styrene , see : f semmler , die ätherischen öle nach ihren chemischen bestandteilen unter berücksichtigung der geschichtlichen entwicklung the volatile liquids according to their chemical components with regard to historical development , vol he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' note that blyth and hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as c 16 h 8 because at that time , some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( 6 instead of 12 ) they had also determined that simon 's '' styrol oxide '' – which they renamed '' metastyrol '' – had the same empirical formula as styrene and in 1866 the french chemist marcelin berthelot stated that '' metastyrol '' was a polymer of styrene ( i.e in 1845 , french chemist emil kopp suggested that the two compounds were identical , kopp , e ( 1845 ) , '' recherches sur l'acide cinnamique et sur le cinnamène '' ( investigations of cinnamic acid and cinnamen ) , comptes rendus , 21 : 1376–1380 aromatischen säuren '' ( studies of the so-called aromatic acids ) , annalen der chemie , 137 : 327–359 ; see p however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation , the ability to rotate polarized light , whereas the carbon of styrax deflects by 3 degrees the neutral tint i.e , the relative orientation of the polarized quartz plates at which the light through the polarimeter appears colorless ( length 100 mm ) the vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene , and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production a laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid : : c 6 h 5 ch chco 2 h → c 6 h 5 ch ch 2 + co 2 styrene was first prepared by this method styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans , resulting from oxidation by cytochrome p450 in 2012 , the danish epa concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene the neurotoxic properties of styrene have also been studied and reported effects include effects on vision ( although unable to reproduce in a subsequent study ) and on hearing functions

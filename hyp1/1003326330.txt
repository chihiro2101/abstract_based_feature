styrene is named after storax balsam , the resin of liquidambar trees of the altingiaceae plant family styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods ( cinnamon , coffee beans , balsam trees and peanuts ) and is also found in coal tar in 1839 , the german apothecary eduard simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin ( called storax or styrax ( latin ) ) of the american sweetgum tree ( liquidambar styraciflua ) he called the liquid '' styrol '' ( now styrene ) ( 1839 ) '' ueber den flüssigen storax ( styrax liquidus ) '' ( on liquid storax ( styrax liquidus ) , annalen der chemie , 31 : 265–277 268 : '' das flüchtige oel , für welches ich den namen styrol vorschlage , … '' ( the volatile oil , for which i suggest the name '' styrol '' , … ) for further details of the history of styrene , see : f he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' ) by 1845 , the german chemist august hofmann and his student john blyth had determined styrene 's empirical formula : c 8 h 8 note that blyth and hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as c 16 h 8 because at that time , some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( 6 instead of 12 ) they had also determined that simon 's '' styrol oxide '' – which they renamed '' metastyrol '' – had the same empirical formula as styrene '' ( one knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200 & nbsp ; °c , for several hours , is changed into a resinous polymer ( metastyrol ) , and that this polymer , when distilled abruptly , reproduces styrene they had found that cinnamic acid could be decarboxylated to form '' cinnamene '' ( or '' cinnamol '' ) , which appeared to be styrene 1380 : '' je pense qu'il faudra désormais remplacer le mot de styrol par celui de cinnamène , et le métastyrol par le métacinnamène however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation , the relative orientation of the polarized quartz plates at which the light through the polarimeter appears colorless ( length 100 mm ) the vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene , and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production this is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene , requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system styrene is also co-produced commercially in a process known as posm ( lyondell chemical company ) or sm/po ( shell ) for styrene monomer / propylene oxide a laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid : : c 6 h 5 ch chco 2 h → c 6 h 5 ch ch 2 + co 2 styrene was first prepared by this method styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans , resulting from oxidation by cytochrome p450 in 2012 , the danish epa concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene

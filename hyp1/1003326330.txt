styrene is named after storax balsam , the resin of liquidambar trees of the altingiaceae plant family styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods ( cinnamon , coffee beans , balsam trees and peanuts ) and is also found in coal tar in 1839 , the german apothecary eduard simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin ( called storax or styrax ( latin ) ) of the american sweetgum tree ( liquidambar styraciflua ) he called the liquid '' styrol '' ( now styrene ) ( 1839 ) '' ueber den flüssigen storax ( styrax liquidus ) '' ( on liquid storax ( styrax liquidus ) , annalen der chemie , 31 : 265–277 he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' note that blyth and hofmann state the empirical formula of styrene as c 16 h 8 because at that time , some chemists used the wrong atomic mass for carbon ( 6 instead of 12 ) and in 1866 the french chemist marcelin berthelot stated that '' metastyrol '' was a polymer of styrene ( i.e '' ( one knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200 & nbsp ; °c , for several hours , is changed into a resinous polymer ( metastyrol ) , and that this polymer , when distilled abruptly , reproduces styrene in 1845 , french chemist emil kopp suggested that the two compounds were identical , kopp , e ( 1845 ) , '' recherches sur l'acide cinnamique et sur le cinnamène '' ( investigations of cinnamic acid and cinnamen ) , comptes rendus , 21 : 1376–1380 1380 : '' je pense qu'il faudra désormais remplacer le mot de styrol par celui de cinnamène , et le métastyrol par le métacinnamène however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation ( 1876 ) '' die identität von styrol und cinnamol , ein neuer körper aus styrax '' ( the identity of styrol and cinnamol , a new substance from styrax ) , berichte der deutschen chemischen gesellschaft , 9 : 5-6 this is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene , requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system it is reported that an approximately 9:1 mixture of styrene and ethylbenzene is obtained , with a total styrene yield of over 60 % a laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid : : c 6 h 5 ch chco 2 h → c 6 h 5 ch ch 2 + co 2 styrene was first prepared by this method styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans , resulting from oxidation by cytochrome p450 styrene oxide is subsequently hydrolyzed in vivo to styrene glycol by the enzyme epoxide hydrolase in 2012 , the danish epa concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene various regulatory bodies refer to styrene , in various contexts , as a possible or potential human carcinogen

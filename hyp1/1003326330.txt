styrene is named after storax balsam , the resin of liquidambar trees of the altingiaceae plant family styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods ( cinnamon , coffee beans , balsam trees and peanuts ) and is also found in coal tar in 1839 , the german apothecary eduard simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin ( called storax or styrax ( latin ) ) of the american sweetgum tree ( liquidambar styraciflua ) he called the liquid '' styrol '' ( now styrene ) ( 1839 ) '' ueber den flüssigen storax ( styrax liquidus ) '' ( on liquid storax ( styrax liquidus ) , annalen der chemie , 31 : 265–277 268 : '' das flüchtige oel , für welches ich den namen styrol vorschlage , … '' ( the volatile oil , for which i suggest the name '' styrol '' , … ) for further details of the history of styrene , see : f semmler , die ätherischen öle nach ihren chemischen bestandteilen unter berücksichtigung der geschichtlichen entwicklung the volatile liquids according to their chemical components with regard to historical development , vol he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' '' ( for the solid residue , the name '' styrol oxide '' would fit ) by 1845 , the german chemist august hofmann and his student john blyth had determined styrene 's empirical formula : c 8 h 8 they had also determined that simon 's '' styrol oxide '' – which they renamed '' metastyrol '' – had the same empirical formula as styrene 348 : '' analysis as well as synthesis has equally proved that styrol and the vitreous mass ( for which we propose the name of metastyrol ) possess the same constitution per cent '' ( one knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200 & nbsp ; °c , for several hours , is changed into a resinous polymer ( metastyrol ) , and that this polymer , when distilled abruptly , reproduces styrene they had found that cinnamic acid could be decarboxylated to form '' cinnamene '' ( or '' cinnamol '' ) , which appeared to be styrene aromatischen säuren '' ( studies of the so-called aromatic acids ) , annalen der chemie , 137 : 327–359 ; see p however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation the vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene , and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production styrene is also co-produced commercially in a process known as posm ( lyondell chemical company ) or sm/po ( shell ) for styrene monomer / propylene oxide ethane , along with ethylbenzene , is fed to a dehydrogenation reactor with a catalyst capable of simultaneously producing styrene and ethylene styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans , resulting from oxidation by cytochrome p450 in 2012 , the danish epa concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene

styrene is named after storax balsam , the resin of liquidambar trees of the altingiaceae plant family styrene occurs naturally in small quantities in some plants and foods ( cinnamon , coffee beans , balsam trees and peanuts ) and is also found in coal tar in 1839 , the german apothecary eduard simon isolated a volatile liquid from the resin ( called storax or styrax ( latin ) ) of the american sweetgum tree ( liquidambar styraciflua ) 268 : '' das flüchtige oel , für welches ich den namen styrol vorschlage , … '' ( the volatile oil , for which i suggest the name '' styrol '' , … ) for further details of the history of styrene , see : f he also noticed that when styrol was exposed to air , light , or heat , it gradually transformed into a hard , rubber-like substance , which he called '' styrol oxide '' ) by 1845 , the german chemist august hofmann and his student john blyth had determined styrene 's empirical formula : c 8 h 8 they had also determined that simon 's '' styrol oxide '' – which they renamed '' metastyrol '' – had the same empirical formula as styrene they had found that cinnamic acid could be decarboxylated to form '' cinnamene '' ( or '' cinnamol '' ) , which appeared to be styrene 1380 : '' je pense qu'il faudra désormais remplacer le mot de styrol par celui de cinnamène , et le métastyrol par le métacinnamène ) and in 1866 , erlenmeyer suggested that both '' cinnamol '' and styrene might be vinylbenzene aromatischen säuren '' ( studies of the so-called aromatic acids ) , annalen der chemie , 137 : 327–359 ; see p however , the styrene that was obtained from cinnamic acid seemed different from the styrene that was obtained by distilling storax resin : the latter was optical rotation , the ability to rotate polarized light , whereas the carbon of styrax deflects by 3 degrees the neutral tint i.e the vast majority of styrene is produced from ethylbenzene , and almost all ethylbenzene produced worldwide is intended for styrene production around 80 % of styrene is produced by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene this is energy intensive and is further complicated by the tendency of styrene to undergo thermally induced polymerisation into polystyrene , requiring the continuous addition of polymerization inhibitor to the system a laboratory synthesis of styrene entails the decarboxylation of cinnamic acid : : c 6 h 5 ch chco 2 h → c 6 h 5 ch ch 2 + co 2 styrene was first prepared by this method styrene will polymerise spontaneously to polystyrene , without the need of external initiators styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans , resulting from oxidation by cytochrome p450 in 2012 , the danish epa concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene the neurotoxic properties of styrene have also been studied and reported effects include effects on vision ( although unable to reproduce in a subsequent study ) and on hearing functions

there had been debate over whether to classify this species as lynx rufus or felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of lynx should be given their own genus , or be placed as a subgenus of felis the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l lynx rufus oaxacensis ) remains under review : lynx rufus rufus – east of the great plains , north america lynx rufus fasciatus – west of the great plains , north america the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada they appear black , but may still exhibit a spot pattern the face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back the pupils are round , black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception bobcat swims across lake lanier youtube ( august 3 , 2015 ) the adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of its distinctive stubby tail , averaging ; the tail , which appears '' bobbed '' and gives the species its name , adds an adult stands about at the shoulders adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of dk adult ( 2005 ) , the largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching furthermore , a june 20 , 2012 report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal 's weight at 60-pound bobcat turns up as roadkill union leader the largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l floridanus , particularly those in the southern appalachians the bobcat is muscular , and its hind legs are longer than its front legs , giving it a somewhat irregular gait a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes it keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight , and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range the average is estimated at one bobcat per the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat it then pounces , grabbing its prey with its sharp , retractable claws however , some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified , as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals it has been known to kill deer or pronghorn , and sometimes to hunt elk in western north america , especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce , or when deer populations become more abundant however , other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations , with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage with the canada lynx , however , the interspecific competition affects distribution patterns ; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative the average bobcat lifespan is 7 years long and rarely exceeds 10 years bobcats generally begin mating by their second summer , though females may start as early as their first year a dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times , generally from winter until early spring ; this varies by location , but most mating takes place during february and march one study found an average infection rate of 52 % from toxoplasma gondii , but with great regional variation the bobcat 's range does not seem to be limited by human populations , but by availability of suitable habitat ; only large , intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species for bobcats , preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability stories featuring the bobcat , in many variations , are found in some indigenous cultures of north america , with parallels in south america

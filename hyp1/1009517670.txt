the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l californicus ( mearns ) – california west of the sierra nevada l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l peninsularis ( thomas ) – baja california l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail the ears are black-tipped and pointed , with short , black tufts bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats , while those in the northern , forested regions are darkest a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada the face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back the pupils are round , black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of ) , animal : the definitive visual guide to the world 's wildlife the bobcat is muscular , and its hind legs are longer than its front legs , giving it a somewhat irregular gait the cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats iucn/ssc cat specialist group the bobcat is crepuscular , and is active mostly during twilight it keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight , and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise the home range is marked with feces , urine scent , and by clawing prominent trees in the area '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors its den smells strongly of the bobcat one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal like most felines , the bobcat is largely solitary , but ranges often overlap unusual for cats , males are more tolerant of overlap , while females rarely wander into others ' ranges given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant during lean periods , it often preys on larger animals , which it can kill and return to feed on later in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat 's principal prey ; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet the bobcat hunts animals of different sizes , and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly for slightly larger animals , such as geese , ducks , rabbits , and hares , it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack during courtship , the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams , hisses , or other sounds like other lynx species , bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears , in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them it ranges from the humid swamps of florida to desert lands of texas or rugged mountain areas its population in canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the canadian lynx in the 1970s and 1980s , an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting , but by the early 1990s , prices had dropped significantly educating local residents about the animals is critical , as well , for conservation in urban areas

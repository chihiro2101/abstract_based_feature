there had been debate over whether to classify this species as lynx rufus or felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of lynx should be given their own genus , or be placed as a subgenus of felis the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l oaxacensis ( goodwin ) – oaxaca l pallescens ( merriam ) – northwestern united states and southern british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan l peninsularis ( thomas ) – baja california l lynx rufus oaxacensis ) remains under review : lynx rufus rufus – east of the great plains , north america lynx rufus fasciatus – west of the great plains , north america the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back however , cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of dk adult ( 2005 ) , the largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching union leader the largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l gigas , while the smallest are from the southeastern subspecies l a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes this behavior may vary seasonally , as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey , which are more active during the day in colder weather bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories , which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey the home range is marked with feces , urine scent , and by clawing prominent trees in the area '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter like most felines , the bobcat is largely solitary , but ranges often overlap unusual for cats , males are more tolerant of overlap , while females rarely wander into others ' ranges given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range the average is estimated at one bobcat per during lean periods , it often preys on larger animals , which it can kill and return to feed on later the bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source the bobcat is an opportunistic predator that , unlike the more specialized canada lynx , readily varies its prey selection the bobcat hunts animals of different sizes , and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly however , some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified , as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals the average bobcat lifespan is 7 years long and rarely exceeds 10 years however seldomly , it may be killed in interspecific conflict by several larger predators or fall prey to them like other lynx species , bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears , in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them the bobcat may have external parasites , mostly ticks and fleas , and often carries the parasites of its prey , especially those of rabbits and squirrels its population in canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the canadian lynx animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges a study in coastal southern california has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization , creation of roads , and other developments

the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l fasciatus ( rafinesque ) – oregon , washington west of the cascade range , northwestern california , and southwestern british columbia l pallescens ( merriam ) – northwestern united states and southern british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats , while those in the northern , forested regions are darkest kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots a few melanism bobcats have been sighted and captured in florida , usa and new brunswick , canada they appear black , but may still exhibit a spot pattern dk adult ( 2005 ) , the largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed , although unverified reports have them reaching furthermore , a june 20 , 2012 report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal 's weight at 60-pound bobcat turns up as roadkill union leader the largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter like most felines , the bobcat is largely solitary , but ranges often overlap when multiple territories overlap , a dominance hierarchy is often established , resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey a link has been observed between population density and sex ratio when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes , along with their fledglings and eggs status of missouri 's experimental trumpeter swan restoration program the bobcat is an opportunistic predator that , unlike the more specialized canada lynx , readily varies its prey selection diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat 's principal prey ; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet it then pounces , grabbing its prey with its sharp , retractable claws for slightly larger animals , such as geese , ducks , rabbits , and hares , it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within before rushing in to attack bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry according to the national agricultural statistics service , bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004 , comprising 4.9 % of all sheep predator deaths however , some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified , as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals it stalks the deer , often when the deer is lying down , then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat , base of the skull , or chest however , other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations , with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage with the canada lynx , however , the interspecific competition affects distribution patterns ; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative the oldest wild bobcat on record was 16 years old , and the oldest captive bobcat lived to be 32 bobcats generally begin mating by their second summer , though females may start as early as their first year the female may later go on to mate with other males , and males generally mate with several females the bobcat 's range does not seem to be limited by human populations , but by availability of suitable habitat ; only large , intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species as a result , the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter , when hunting season is generally open liver autopsies in california bobcats that have succumbed to notoedric mange have revealed chronic rodenticide exposure

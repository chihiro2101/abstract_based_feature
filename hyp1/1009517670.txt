the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l gigas ( bangs ) – northern new york to nova scotia and new brunswick l floridanus ( rafinesque ) – southeastern united states and inland to the mississippi valley , up to southwestern missouri and southern illinois l superiorensis ( peterson & downing ) – western great lakes area , including upper michigan , wisconsin , southern ontario , and most of minnesota l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l californicus ( mearns ) – california west of the sierra nevada l mohavensis ( b.anderson ) – mojave desert of california l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l oaxacensis ( goodwin ) – oaxaca l pallescens ( merriam ) – northwestern united states and southern british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan l the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots they appear black , but may still exhibit a spot pattern the face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back the pupils are round , black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception however , cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded 60-pound bobcat turns up as roadkill at birth , it weighs and is about in length the cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats the bobcat is crepuscular , and is active mostly during twilight . social structure and home range bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories , which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation like most felines , the bobcat is largely solitary , but ranges often overlap when multiple territories overlap , a dominance hierarchy is often established , resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant during lean periods , it often preys on larger animals , which it can kill and return to feed on later the bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source and papers of the 10th trumpeter swan society conf diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat 's principal prey ; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet it stalks the deer , often when the deer is lying down , then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat , base of the skull , or chest on the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer , it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves , often returning to it several times to feed sperm production begins each year by september or october , and the male is fertile into the summer like other lynx species , bobcats probably avoid encounters with bears , in part because they are likely to lose kills to them or may rarely be attacked by them it is listed as least concern on the iucn red list , noting it is relatively widespread and abundant , but information from southern mexico is poor stories featuring the bobcat , in many variations , are found in some indigenous cultures of north america , with parallels in south america

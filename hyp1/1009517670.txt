there had been debate over whether to classify this species as lynx rufus or felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of lynx should be given their own genus , or be placed as a subgenus of felis the genus lynx is now accepted , and the bobcat is listed as lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources the genus lynx shares a clade with the genetic lineages puma , prionailurus and felis dated to ; lynx diverged approximately the bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx , which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene , with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america , which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers this population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north , developing into the modern canada lynx 13 bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristics : l rufus ( schreber ) – eastern and midwestern united states l superiorensis ( peterson & downing ) – western great lakes area , including upper michigan , wisconsin , southern ontario , and most of minnesota l baileyi ( merriam ) – southwestern united states and northwestern mexico l allen ) – central mexico , with a northern extension along the west coast to southern sonora l fasciatus ( rafinesque ) – oregon , washington west of the cascade range , northwestern california , and southwestern british columbia l pallescens ( merriam ) – northwestern united states and southern british columbia , alberta , and saskatchewan l lynx rufus oaxacensis ) remains under review : lynx rufus rufus – east of the great plains , north america lynx rufus fasciatus – west of the great plains , north america the bobcat resembles other species of the midsize genus lynx , but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable , though generally tan to grayish-brown , with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail generally , an off-white color is seen on the lips , chin , and underparts bobcat eyes are yellow with round , black pupils the nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red , and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face , sides , and back youtube ( august 3 , 2015 ) the adult bobcat is long from the head to the base of its distinctive stubby tail , averaging ; the tail , which appears '' bobbed '' and gives the species its name , adds an adult stands about at the shoulders adult males can range in weight from , with an average of ; females at , with an average of furthermore , a june 20 , 2012 report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal 's weight at union leader the largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l the bobcat is muscular , and its hind legs are longer than its front legs , giving it a somewhat irregular gait a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united states found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens , suggesting differing natural selection for the sexes the bobcat is crepuscular , and is active mostly during twilight this behavior may vary seasonally , as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey , which are more active during the day in colder weather bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories , which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey '' patterns in bobcat ( lynx rufus ) scent marking and communication behaviors the sizes of bobcats ' home ranges vary significantly ; a world conservation union ( iucn ) summary of research suggests ranges from one study in kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly , and females less than half that area transient bobcats were found to have both larger ( roughly and less well-defined home ranges one study found a large variation in male range sizes , from in summer up to in winter other research in various american states has shown little or no seasonal variation given their smaller range sizes , two or more females may reside within a male 's home range when multiple territories overlap , a dominance hierarchy is often established , resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas in line with widely differing estimates of home range size , population density figures are divergent , from one to 38 bobcats per in one survey one study noted a dense , unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of 2.1 males per female the bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food , but eats heavily when prey is abundant its main prey varies by region : in the eastern united states , it is the eastern cottontail and new england cottontail , and in the north , it is the snowshoe hare when these prey species exist together , as in new england , they are the primary food sources of the bobcat in the far south , the rabbits and hares are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source birds up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambushes , along with their fledglings and eggs they start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months the bobcat 's range does not seem to be limited by human populations , but by availability of suitable habitat ; only large , intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species the bobcat does not tolerate deep snow , and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas ; it lacks the large , padded feet of the canadian lynx and can not support its weight on snow as efficiently a study in coastal southern california has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization , creation of roads , and other developments dreaming of two deities , cougar and lynx , they thought , would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes

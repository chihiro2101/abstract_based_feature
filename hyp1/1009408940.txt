raï is a type of algerian popular music that arose in the 1920s in the port city of oran , and that self-consciously ran counter to accepted artistic and social mores in the years just following world war i , the algerian city of oran—known as “ little paris ” —was a melting pot of various cultures , full of nightclubs and cabarets ; it was the place to go for a bawdy good time out of this milieu arose a group of male and female muslim singers called chioukhs and cheikhates , who rejected the refined , classical poetry of traditional algerian music instead , to the accompaniment of pottery drums and end-blown flutes , they sang about the adversity of urban life in a raw , gritty , sometimes vulgar , and inevitably controversial language that appealed especially to the socially and economically disadvantaged the music performed was called raï it drew its name from the algerian arabic word raï ( “ opinion ” or “ advice ” ) , which was typically inserted—and repeated—by singers to fill time as they formulated a new phrase of improvised lyrics by the early 1940s cheikha rimitti had emerged locally as a musical and linguistic luminary in the raï tradition , and she continued to be among the music ’ s most prominent performers into the 21st century by independence in 1962 , the jewish quarter ( known as the derb ) , was home to musicians like reinette l'oranaise , saoud l'oranais and larbi bensari hawzi classical music was popular during this time , and female singers of the genre included cheikha tetma , fadila d'zirya and myriam fekkai a common characteristic of these songs included exclamations of the word '' raï ! '' and variations thereof these cheikhas , who sang for both men and women , included people such as cheikha remitti el reliziana , cheikha grélo , cheikha djenia el mostganmia , cheikha bachitta de mascara , and cheikha a ; ouachma el tmouchentia when first developed , raï was a hybrid blend of rural and cabaret musical genres , invented by and targeted toward distillery workers , peasants who had lost their land to european settlers , and other types of lower class citizens the geographical location of oran allowed for the spread of many cultural influences , allowing raï musicians to absorb an assortment of musical styles such as flamenco from spain , gnawa music , and french cabaret , allowing them to combine with the rhythms typical of arab nomads in contrast to other algerian music , raï incorporated dancing in addition to music , particularly in a mixed-gender environment the number of public performances by female raï singers decreased , which led to men playing an increased role in this genre of music meanwhile , traditional raï instruments such as the gasba ( reed flute ) , and the derbouka ( north african drums ) were replaced with the violin and accordion this marked the beginning of pop raï , which was performed by a later generation which adopted the title of cheb ( male ) or chaba ( female ) , meaning “ young , ” to distinguish themselves from the older musicians who continued to perform in the original style however , by the time the first international raï festival was held in algeria in 1985 , cheb khaled had become virtually synonymous with the genre more festivals followed in algeria and abroad , and raï became a popular and prominent new genre in the emergent world-music market however , this suppression was overturned due to raï 's growing popularity in france , where it was strongly demanded by the maghrebi arab community previously , the algerian government had opposed raï because of its sexually and culturally risqué topics , such as alcohol and consumerism , two subjects that were taboo to the traditional islamic culture in 1985 , algerian colonel snoussi joined with french minister of culture jack lang to convince the algerian state to accept raï later in the decade , funk , hip hop , and other influences were added to raï , especially by performers like faudel and rachid taha , the latter of whom took raï music and fused it with rock another mix of cultures in arabic music of the late 1990s came through franco-arabic music released by musicians such as aldo by 1979 , when president chadli bendjedid endorsed more liberal moral and economic standards , raï music became further associated with algerian youth '' arab noise and ramadan nights : raï , rap , and franco-maghrebi identities the conservativeness not only affected the way listeners received raï music , but also the way the artists , especially female artists , presented their own music

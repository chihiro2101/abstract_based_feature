edl delivered output in ibm machine code for system/3 or system/7 and for the series/1 by an emulator series/1 was also the first computer that ibm supported for unix series/1 computers were also utilized in the early development of gm 's manufacturing automation protocol ( map ) commercial applications of customized series/1 computers included an application by state farm as an intelligent remote terminal in agents ' offices the series/1 used for pos systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two ibm pc at computers running either ibm 3683 or ibm 4683 registers the deluxe corporation also used a bank of series/1 ibm 4956 computers for each check printing facility which handled the plant 's business and personal check sales orders and printing operations severn trent used a number of series/1 computers running the rps operating system to collect and process river telemetry outstation data unusually , the communications link between the ibm series/1 machines and the icl 2900 machine used the icl co3 protocol rather than one of the ( de facto standard ) ibm communication protocols ) in the 1980s used the series/1 ( running edx ) as a channel-attached front-end communications processor for its ibm mainframe-based mvs/cics hospital information system in this environment the series/1 provided customized interfaces to diverse ( and generally non-ibm ) minicomputer-based hospital systems using asynchronous or binary synchronous communications then commonly found in the laboratory , pharmacy , and other departments these series/1 systems were connected to the mainframe using the series/1 to system/370 channel attach module , and connected to non-ibm systems using the feature-programmable multi-line controller and adapter internally , ibm used banks of series/1 computers as communications front end systems on their ibm information systems commercial network although back end processing was done with system/370 architecture computers the 'class i ' systems were classified as mainframe systems – and the series/1 systems that provided field input to them – that were maintained at and distributed from the three cdpas ibm archive of series/1 with picture ibm 7565 manufacturing system incorporating a series/1 ( see middle of photo ) ibm series/1 equipment modules brochure ibm series/1 documentation on bitsavers

initiall , model 3 ( ibm 4953 ) and model 5 ( ibm 4955 ) processors were provided edl delivered output in ibm machine code for system/3 or system/7 and for the series/1 by an emulator although the series/1 is underpowered by today 's standards , a robust multi-user operating environment ( rps ) was available along with several additional high level languages for the rps os series/1 was also the first computer that ibm supported for unix applications were built using a set of standalone programs , called the base program preparation facilities , consisting of a macro assembler , a link editor and some basic utilities example systems and applications included manufacturing information database ( midb ) , vehicle component verification system ( vcvs ) and aldl ( aldl ) the series/1 used for pos systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two ibm pc at computers running either ibm 3683 or ibm 4683 registers parallel devices were also used for phototypesetting machines , plate makers and teletype brpe punch creating punched tape ; all connecting to the ibm integrated di/do digital in/out card unusually , the communications link between the ibm series/1 machines and the icl 2900 machine used the icl co3 protocol rather than one of the ( de facto standard ) ibm communication protocols ) in the 1980s used the series/1 ( running edx ) as a channel-attached front-end communications processor for its ibm mainframe-based mvs/cics hospital information system internally , ibm used banks of series/1 computers as communications front end systems on their ibm information systems commercial network although back end processing was done with system/370 architecture computers although a cobol compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the marine corps with the series/1 , most class i and class ii systems development was in edl ibm archive of series/1 with picture ibm 7565 manufacturing system incorporating a series/1 ( see middle of photo ) ibm series/1 equipment modules brochure ibm series/1 documentation on bitsavers

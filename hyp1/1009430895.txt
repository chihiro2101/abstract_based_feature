don estridge had been the lead manager on the ibm series/1 minicomputer available were either of two mutually exclusive operating systems : event driven executive or realtime programming system ( rps ) edl delivered output in ibm machine code for system/3 or system/7 and for the series/1 by an emulator the series/1 was also widely used in manufacturing environments , including general motors assembly plants series/1 computers were also utilized in the early development of gm 's manufacturing automation protocol ( map ) commercial applications of customized series/1 computers included an application by state farm as an intelligent remote terminal in agents ' offices the kmart also used the series/1 computer initially for its kmart information network ( kin ) which handled the store 's ordering , invoicing , payroll , inventory , cash , and headquarters to store communications the series/1 used for pos systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two ibm pc at computers running either ibm 3683 or ibm 4683 registers finally , the series/1 provided a cost-effective method for remote support of the distributed mainframes using inexpensive ascii terminals and modems , or ibm pcs equipped with light pens ( emulating the 3278/9 terminals ) these series/1 systems were connected to the mainframe using the series/1 to system/370 channel attach module , and connected to non-ibm systems using the feature-programmable multi-line controller and adapter internally , ibm used banks of series/1 computers as communications front end systems on their ibm information systems commercial network although back end processing was done with system/370 architecture computers the 'class i ' systems were classified as mainframe systems – and the series/1 systems that provided field input to them – that were maintained at and distributed from the three cdpas although a cobol compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the marine corps with the series/1 , most class i and class ii systems development was in edl ibm archive of series/1 with picture ibm 7565 manufacturing system incorporating a series/1 ( see middle of photo ) ibm series/1 equipment modules brochure ibm series/1 documentation on bitsavers

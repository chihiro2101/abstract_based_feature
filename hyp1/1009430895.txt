initiall , model 3 ( ibm 4953 ) and model 5 ( ibm 4955 ) processors were provided available were either of two mutually exclusive operating systems : event driven executive or realtime programming system ( rps ) edl delivered output in ibm machine code for system/3 or system/7 and for the series/1 by an emulator series/1 was also the first computer that ibm supported for unix example systems and applications included manufacturing information database ( midb ) , vehicle component verification system ( vcvs ) and aldl ( aldl ) a separate series /1 computer was later added in the early phases of its pos roll-out networked with ibm 3683 registers the series/1 used for pos systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two ibm pc at computers running either ibm 3683 or ibm 4683 registers the deluxe corporation also used a bank of series/1 ibm 4956 computers for each check printing facility which handled the plant 's business and personal check sales orders and printing operations these series/1 systems were connected to the mainframe using the series/1 to system/370 channel attach module , and connected to non-ibm systems using the feature-programmable multi-line controller and adapter ibm created a ruggedized , portable version with a green plastic and metal housing for field and shipboard use known as the ibm series i model 4110 the 'class i ' systems were classified as mainframe systems – and the series/1 systems that provided field input to them – that were maintained at and distributed from the three cdpas although a cobol compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the marine corps with the series/1 , most class i and class ii systems development was in edl ibm archive of series/1 with picture ibm 7565 manufacturing system incorporating a series/1 ( see middle of photo ) ibm series/1 equipment modules brochure ibm series/1 documentation on bitsavers

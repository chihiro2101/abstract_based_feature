initiall , model 3 ( ibm 4953 ) and model 5 ( ibm 4955 ) processors were provided edl delivered output in ibm machine code for system/3 or system/7 and for the series/1 by an emulator example systems and applications included manufacturing information database ( midb ) , vehicle component verification system ( vcvs ) and aldl ( aldl ) series/1 computers were also utilized in the early development of gm 's manufacturing automation protocol ( map ) commercial applications of customized series/1 computers included an application by state farm as an intelligent remote terminal in agents ' offices the kmart also used the series/1 computer initially for its kmart information network ( kin ) which handled the store 's ordering , invoicing , payroll , inventory , cash , and headquarters to store communications the series/1 used for pos systems was short lived as it was quickly replaced by two ibm pc at computers running either ibm 3683 or ibm 4683 registers the deluxe corporation also used a bank of series/1 ibm 4956 computers for each check printing facility which handled the plant 's business and personal check sales orders and printing operations various serial peripherals were attached : printronix bar-coding printers , micr readers , ibm ascii terminals finally , the series/1 provided a cost-effective method for remote support of the distributed mainframes using inexpensive ascii terminals and modems , or ibm pcs equipped with light pens ( emulating the 3278/9 terminals ) these series/1 systems were connected to the mainframe using the series/1 to system/370 channel attach module , and connected to non-ibm systems using the feature-programmable multi-line controller and adapter internally , ibm used banks of series/1 computers as communications front end systems on their ibm information systems commercial network although back end processing was done with system/370 architecture computers although a cobol compiler was available as part of the software package sold to the marine corps with the series/1 , most class i and class ii systems development was in edl ibm archive of series/1 with picture ibm 7565 manufacturing system incorporating a series/1 ( see middle of photo ) ibm series/1 equipment modules brochure ibm series/1 documentation on bitsavers

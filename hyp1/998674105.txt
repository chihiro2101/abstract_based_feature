as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are two main centers of primatology , western primatology and japanese primatology although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates the focus is on studying the common links between humans and primates it is believed that by understanding our closest animal relatives , we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors primatology is a science field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat although there are certain western primatologists who do more subjective research , the emphasis in this discipline is on the objective early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers in 1960 , jane goodall traveled to the forest at gombe stream in tanzania where her determination and skill allowed for her to observe behaviors of the chimpanzees that no researcher had seen prior additionally , dian fossey 's work conducted at the karisoke research station in rwanda proved the possibility of habituation among the mountain gorillas bernstein sarah blaffer hrdy christophe boesch geoffrey bourne josep call c imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology he is a co-founder of the primate research institute and the centre for african area studies the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates the japanese theory believes that studying primates will give us insight into the duality of human nature : individual self vs the traditional and cultural aspects of japanese science lend themselves to an '' older sibling '' mentality this is not to say that the japanese study of primatology is cruel – far from it – just that it does not feel that their subjects should be given reverential treatment though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research neutrality is eschewed in favour of a more casual atmosphere , where researcher and subject can mingle more freely japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight , and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered comprehensive data on every single subject in a group is a uniquely japanese trait of primate research the study of primates is a group effort , and the group will get the credit for it the sts approach to primatology and sociobiology stretches beyond studying the apes , into the realm of observing the people studying the apes animals such as gorillas , chimpanzees and orangutans resemble humans closely , so linnaeus placed homo sapiens together with other similar-looking organisms into the taxonomic order primates humans and simians share the vast majority of their dna , with chimpanzees sharing between 97-99 % genetic identity with humans the amount of grooming taking place between members of a troop is a potent indicator of alliance formation or troop solidarity robin dunbar suggests a link between primate grooming and the development of human language in order to understand the staggeringly complex nature of primate interactions , we look to theory of mind warneken 's subjects rapidly figured out which individual in the group was the best rope puller and assigned it the bulk of the task this type of logic appears to be lost on the baboon , suggesting a serious gap in theory of mind of this otherwise seemingly very intelligent primate species as mentioned above , the western primatology tries to minimize subjectivity , while the japanese primatology tends to embrace the closeness inherent in studying nature american journal of primatology folia primatologica international journal of primatology journal of medical primatology journal of human evolution primates

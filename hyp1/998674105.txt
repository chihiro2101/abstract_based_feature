as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are two main centers of primatology , western primatology and japanese primatology although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates it is believed that by understanding our closest animal relatives , we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors the general belief is that the scientific observation of nature must be either extremely limited , or completely controlled there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat such facilities include the living links center at the yerkes national primate research center in georgia , us and the elgin center at lion country safari in florida , us all types of primate study in the western methodology are meant to be neutral early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers additionally , dian fossey 's work conducted at the karisoke research station in rwanda proved the possibility of habituation among the mountain gorillas galdikas utilized statistics and modern data collection to conclude her 1978 doctoral thesis regarding orangutan behavior and interactions the discipline of japanese primatology was developed out of animal ecology imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology he helped found the primate research group in 1950 junichiro was a renowned anthropologist and a professor at kyoto university the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates the japanese theory believes that studying primates will give us insight into the duality of human nature : individual self vs one particular japanese primatologist , kawai masao , introduced the concept of kyokan this was the theory that the only way to attain reliable scientific knowledge was to attain a mutual relation , personal attachment and shared life with the animal subjects though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight , and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered comprehensive data on every single subject in a group is a uniquely japanese trait of primate research a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories kinji imanishi junichiro itani kawai masao tetsuro matsuzawa toshisada nishida satsue mito modern molecular biology reinforced humanity 's place within the primate order humans and simians share the vast majority of their dna , with chimpanzees sharing between 97-99 % genetic identity with humans if the mind is a general computer , for instance , the ability to use reasoning should be identical regardless of the context however primates do not always fare so well in situations requiring theory of mind pressing one lever would bring them food and another would bring their grooming partner food social critics of science , some operating from within the field , are critical of primatology and sociobiology linda fedigan views herself as a reporter or translator , working at the intersection between gender studies of science and the mainstream study of primatology physical anthropology primatologists human genetics human evolutionary genetics primate research centers

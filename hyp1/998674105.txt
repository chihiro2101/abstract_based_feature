as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are two main centers of primatology , western primatology and japanese primatology although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates it is believed that by understanding our closest animal relatives , we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors the general belief is that the scientific observation of nature must be either extremely limited , or completely controlled there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat in semi-free ranging studies , scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them , and the ability to control their environments such facilities include the living links center at the yerkes national primate research center in georgia , us and the elgin center at lion country safari in florida , us although there are certain western primatologists who do more subjective research , the emphasis in this discipline is on the objective early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers in 1960 , jane goodall traveled to the forest at gombe stream in tanzania where her determination and skill allowed for her to observe behaviors of the chimpanzees that no researcher had seen prior long-term sites of research tend to be best associated with their founders , and this led to some tension between younger primatologists and the veterans in the field imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates the japanese theory believes that studying primates will give us insight into the duality of human nature : individual self vs this is not to say that the japanese study of primatology is cruel – far from it – just that it does not feel that their subjects should be given reverential treatment though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research domestication of nature is not only desirable , but necessary for study japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight , and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered each member of the primate community has a part to play , and the japanese researchers are interested in this complex interaction for japanese researchers in primatology , the findings of the team are emphasised over the individual the study of primates is a group effort , and the group will get the credit for it a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories the interface between primatology and sociobiology examines in detail the evolution of primate behavioral processes , and what studying our closest living primate relatives can tell about our own minds '' ( '' i am a primate ; nothing about primates is outside of my bailiwick '' before darwin , and before molecular biology , the father of modern taxonomy , carl linnaeus , organized natural objects into kinds , that we now know reflect their evolutionary relatedness although social grooming is observed in many animal species , the grooming activities undertaken by primates are not strictly for the elimination of parasites the size of the neocortex in a primate 's brain correlates directly to the number of individuals it can keep track of socially , be it a troop of chimps or a tribe of humans further evidence supporting the modular mind has steadily emerged with some startling revelations concerning primates the conceptualization of both human infants and primate adults is cross-sensory , meaning that they can add 15 red dots to 20 beeps and approximate the answer to be 35 grey squares current scientific practice , especially in the hard sciences , requires a total dissociation of personal experience from the finished scientific product ( bauchspies 8 ) physical anthropology primatologists human genetics human evolutionary genetics primate research centers

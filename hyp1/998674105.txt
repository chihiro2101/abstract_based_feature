as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are two main centers of primatology , western primatology and japanese primatology although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates it is believed that by understanding our closest animal relatives , we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors this allows for data to be unbiased and for the subjects to be uninfluenced by human interference there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat in semi-free ranging studies , scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them , and the ability to control their environments such facilities include the living links center at the yerkes national primate research center in georgia , us and the elgin center at lion country safari in florida , us all types of primate study in the western methodology are meant to be neutral although there are certain western primatologists who do more subjective research , the emphasis in this discipline is on the objective additionally , dian fossey 's work conducted at the karisoke research station in rwanda proved the possibility of habituation among the mountain gorillas fossey learned that female gorillas are often transferred between groups and gorillas eat their own dung to recycle nutrients long-term sites of research tend to be best associated with their founders , and this led to some tension between younger primatologists and the veterans in the field the discipline of japanese primatology was developed out of animal ecology imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology he helped found the primate research group in 1950 he is a co-founder of the primate research institute and the centre for african area studies the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates this is not to say that the japanese study of primatology is cruel – far from it – just that it does not feel that their subjects should be given reverential treatment one particular japanese primatologist , kawai masao , introduced the concept of kyokan it is believed that the best data comes through identification with your subject japanese primatologists are renowned for their ability to recognise animals by sight , and indeed most primates in a research group are usually named and numbered comprehensive data on every single subject in a group is a uniquely japanese trait of primate research the study of primates is a group effort , and the group will get the credit for it a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories the interface between primatology and sociobiology examines in detail the evolution of primate behavioral processes , and what studying our closest living primate relatives can tell about our own minds animals such as gorillas , chimpanzees and orangutans resemble humans closely , so linnaeus placed homo sapiens together with other similar-looking organisms into the taxonomic order primates modern molecular biology reinforced humanity 's place within the primate order if the mind is a general computer , for instance , the ability to use reasoning should be identical regardless of the context his studies have shown that chimpanzees can recognize whether a researcher desires a dropped object , and act accordingly by picking it up because of the high number of women , schiebinger has even asserted that '' primatology is widely celebrated as a feminist science '' physical anthropology primatologists human genetics human evolutionary genetics primate research centers

as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are two main centers of primatology , western primatology and japanese primatology although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates it is believed that by understanding our closest animal relatives , we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors either way , the observers must be neutral to their subjects there are three methodological approaches in primatology : field study , the more realistic approach ; laboratory study , the more controlled approach ; and semi-free ranging , where primate habitat and wild social structure is replicated in a captive setting field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat in semi-free ranging studies , scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them , and the ability to control their environments all types of primate study in the western methodology are meant to be neutral early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers long-term sites of research tend to be best associated with their founders , and this led to some tension between younger primatologists and the veterans in the field imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates social evolution and anthropology are of primary interest to them the traditional and cultural aspects of japanese science lend themselves to an '' older sibling '' mentality this is not to say that the japanese study of primatology is cruel – far from it – just that it does not feel that their subjects should be given reverential treatment this was the theory that the only way to attain reliable scientific knowledge was to attain a mutual relation , personal attachment and shared life with the animal subjects though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research domestication of nature is not only desirable , but necessary for study each member of the primate community has a part to play , and the japanese researchers are interested in this complex interaction for japanese researchers in primatology , the findings of the team are emphasised over the individual a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories where sociobiology attempts to understand the actions of all animal species within the context of advantageous and disadvantageous behaviors , primatology takes an exclusive look at the order primates , which includes homo sapiens the interface between primatology and sociobiology examines in detail the evolution of primate behavioral processes , and what studying our closest living primate relatives can tell about our own minds before darwin , and before molecular biology , the father of modern taxonomy , carl linnaeus , organized natural objects into kinds , that we now know reflect their evolutionary relatedness animals such as gorillas , chimpanzees and orangutans resemble humans closely , so linnaeus placed homo sapiens together with other similar-looking organisms into the taxonomic order primates modern molecular biology reinforced humanity 's place within the primate order robin dunbar suggests a link between primate grooming and the development of human language fodor 's modular mind hypothesis expands on this concept , suggesting the existence of preprogrammed modules for dealing with many , or all aspects of cognition social critics of science , some operating from within the field , are critical of primatology and sociobiology in particular , the use of primatological studies to assert gender roles , and to both promote and subvert feminism has been a point of contention linda fedigan views herself as a reporter or translator , working at the intersection between gender studies of science and the mainstream study of primatology physical anthropology primatologists human genetics human evolutionary genetics primate research centers

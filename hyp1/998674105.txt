as a science , primatology has many different sub-disciplines which vary in terms of theoretical and methodological approaches to the subject used in researching extant primates and their extinct ancestors there are two main centers of primatology , western primatology and japanese primatology although , fundamentally , both western and japanese primatology share many of the same principles , the areas of their focus in primate research and their methods of obtaining data differ widely western primatology stems primarily from research by north american and european scientists early primate study focused primarily on medical research , but some scientists also conducted '' civilizing '' experiments on chimpanzees in order to gauge both primate intelligence and the limits of their brainpower the study of primatology looks at the biological and psychological aspects of non-human primates it is believed that by understanding our closest animal relatives , we might better understand the nature shared with our ancestors field study is done in natural environments , in which scientific observers watch primates in their natural habitat in semi-free ranging studies , scientists are able to watch how primates might act in the wild but have easier access to them , and the ability to control their environments all types of primate study in the western methodology are meant to be neutral although there are certain western primatologists who do more subjective research , the emphasis in this discipline is on the objective early field primatology tended to focus on individual researchers researchers such as dian fossey and jane goodall and birute galdikas are examples of this fossey learned that female gorillas are often transferred between groups and gorillas eat their own dung to recycle nutrients the third '' trimate '' , birute galdikas , spent over 12 years becoming habituated to the orangutans in borneo , indonesia long-term sites of research tend to be best associated with their founders , and this led to some tension between younger primatologists and the veterans in the field imanishi was an animal ecologist who began studying wild horses before focusing more on primate ecology he helped found the primate research group in 1950 the japanese discipline of primatology tends to be more interested in the social aspects of primates social evolution and anthropology are of primary interest to them the japanese theory believes that studying primates will give us insight into the duality of human nature : individual self vs this is not to say that the japanese study of primatology is cruel – far from it – just that it does not feel that their subjects should be given reverential treatment though kawai is the only japanese primatologist associated with the use of this term , the underlying principle is part of the foundation of japanese primate research comprehensive data on every single subject in a group is a uniquely japanese trait of primate research each member of the primate community has a part to play , and the japanese researchers are interested in this complex interaction the study of primates is a group effort , and the group will get the credit for it a team of researchers may observe a group of primates for several years in order to gather very detailed demographic and social histories animals such as gorillas , chimpanzees and orangutans resemble humans closely , so linnaeus placed homo sapiens together with other similar-looking organisms into the taxonomic order primates modern molecular biology reinforced humanity 's place within the primate order although social grooming is observed in many animal species , the grooming activities undertaken by primates are not strictly for the elimination of parasites robin dunbar suggests a link between primate grooming and the development of human language the size of the neocortex in a primate 's brain correlates directly to the number of individuals it can keep track of socially , be it a troop of chimps or a tribe of humans in order to understand the staggeringly complex nature of primate interactions , we look to theory of mind one phenomenon which would indicate a possible fragility of theory of mind in primates occurs when a baboon gets lost scientific studies concerning primate and human behavior have been subject to the same set of political and social complications , or biases , as every other scientific discipline physical anthropology primatologists human genetics human evolutionary genetics primate research centers

every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb working spaces , such as srgb , adobe rgb or prophoto are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices in nearly every translation process , we have to deal with the fact that the color gamut of different devices vary in range which makes an accurate reproduction impossible color management : color space conversion , cambridge in color icc specification icc.1:2010 before the actual rendering intent is carried out , one can temporarily simulate the rendering by soft proofing since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) some image software ( such as photoshop ) perform automatic color separation to maintain color information in cmyk mode using a specified icc profile such as us web coated ( swop ) v2 gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management

every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space calibration is like characterization , except that it can include the adjustment of the device , as opposed to just the measurement of the device color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space macos has added automatic color management ( assuming srgb for most things ) automatically in the os , and applications have to work around this to provide more accurate color management since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) wcs supplements the image color management ( icm ) system in windows 2000 and windows xp , originally written by heidelberg although disabled by default in firefox 3.0 , icc v2 and icc v4 color management could be enabled by using an add-on color management add-on by sean hayes gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management

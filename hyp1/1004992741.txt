every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space often a step called linearization is performed first , to undo the effect of gamma correction that was done to get the most out of limited 8-bit color paths as an intermediate result , the device gamut is described in the form of scattered measurement data color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device the key issue here is how to deal with a color that can not be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color , just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) although disabled by default in firefox 3.0 , icc v2 and icc v4 color management could be enabled by using an add-on color management add-on by sean hayes , notable browser support for color management is : firefox : from version 3.5 enabled by default for icc v2 tagged images , version 8.0 has icc v4 profiles support , but it needs to be activated manually gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management

each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space often a step called linearization is performed first , to undo the effect of gamma correction that was done to get the most out of limited 8-bit color paths this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb the international color consortium standard was created to bring various developers and manufacturers together the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices color transformations can be represented by two profiles ( source profile and target profile ) or by a devicelink profile in the terminology of the international color consortium , a translation between two color spaces can go through a profile connection space ( pcs ) : color space 1 → pcs ( cielab or ciexyz ) → color space 2 ; conversions into and out of the pcs are each specified by a profile since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) although disabled by default in firefox 3.0 , icc v2 and icc v4 color management could be enabled by using an add-on color management add-on by sean hayes gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management

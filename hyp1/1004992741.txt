every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device in the terminology of the international color consortium , a translation between two color spaces can go through a profile connection space ( pcs ) : color space 1 → pcs ( cielab or ciexyz ) → color space 2 ; conversions into and out of the pcs are each specified by a profile the color management system can utilize various methods to achieve desired results and give experienced users control of the gamut mapping behavior if an entire image is in-gamut , relative is perfect , but when there are out of gamut colors , which is preferable depends on a case-by-case basis the key issue here is how to deal with a color that can not be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color , just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different since 1997 color management in windows is available through an icc color management system ( icm ) , notable browser support for color management is : firefox : from version 3.5 enabled by default for icc v2 tagged images , version 8.0 has icc v4 profiles support , but it needs to be activated manually gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management

every color-managed device requires a personalized table , or '' color profile , '' which characterizes the color response of that particular device each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors ( the '' profile connection space '' ) this is usually performed by a color management module ( cmm ) to describe the behavior of various output devices , they must be compared ( measured ) in relation to a standard color space often a step called linearization is performed first , to undo the effect of gamma correction that was done to get the most out of limited 8-bit color paths after the profiling is finished , an idealized color description of the device is created color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as srgb ; when such calibration is done well enough , no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently this avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of srgb the icc standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata working spaces , such as srgb , adobe rgb or prophoto are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing color transformation , or color space conversion , is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another it makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device by ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see , this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices although disabled by default in firefox 3.0 , icc v2 and icc v4 color management could be enabled by using an add-on color management add-on by sean hayes gamma correction color chart digital printing icc profile international color consortium it8 linux color management

there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington hamilton and madison , who wrote the aforementioned federalist papers against political factions , ended up being the core leaders in this partisanship : hamilton became the leader of federalist party while madison co-helmed the democratic-republican party with thomas jefferson richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates before 1820 , democratic-republican members of congress would nominate a single candidate from their party the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both vice president hubert humphrey secured the presidential nomination despite not winning a single primary under his own name the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process the first regional primary was the southern super tuesday of march 8 , 1988 , in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests the 1988 presidential election in the south : continuity amidst change in southern party politics ( 1991 ) pp 3–20 it failed as all but two of the eight major candidates won at least one primary on that day to retain its tradition as the first primary in the country ( and adhere to a state law which requires it to be ) , new hampshire moved their primary forward , from early march to early january a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates the primary and caucus system is the only method in which voters in puerto rico , guam , and other u.s territories are not represented in the electoral college , and thus voters residing in those areas are basically ineligible to vote in the general election in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states an incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party 's primaries , especially if they are still popular during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter bush during the 1992 republican primaries , but only received a handful of delegates ; bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to clinton both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party 's bylaws the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate these are each states ' two national committeepersons and the state chairperson some superdelegates are former or current state or federal lobbyists david weigel , democrats vote to bind most superdelegates to state primary results , washington post ( july 23 , 2016 ) while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses instead of going to a polling place , voters attend local private events run by the political parties , and cast their selections there one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates some states may use a binding walking subcaucus system , where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local , county or state party convention , which then in turn selects pledged delegates to the national convention a handful of states may also practice non-binding '' beauty contests '' , which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention , which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory in addition , the democratic party may reject any candidate under their bylaws is based on two main factors : ( 1 ) the proportion of votes each state gave to the democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections , and ( 2 ) the number of electoral votes each state has in the united states electoral college territories of american samoa , guam , the northern mariana islands , puerto rico , and the us virgin islands are instead assigned a fixed number of pledged delegates the number of republican pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 u.s states is 10 at-large delegates , plus three district delegates for each congressional district since the 1970s , states have held increasingly early primaries to maximize their leverage '' front-loading , caucuses and primaries '' should any other state move its primary too close to new hampshire 's , or before , the new hampshire secretary of state is required to reschedule the primary accordingly in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention '' first-in-the-nation presidential primary '' , state of new hampshire manual for the general court , ( department of state ) no.55 , 1997

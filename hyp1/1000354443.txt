there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan 10 , alexander hamilton and james madison , respectively , wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic political factions thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates that system collapsed in 1824 , and since 1832 the preferred mechanism for nomination has been a national convention chase ; emergence of the presidential nominating convention , 1789–1832 ( 1973 ) the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses florida enacted the first presidential primary in 1901 the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention the primary received its first major test in the 1912 election pitting incumbent president william howard taft against challengers theodore roosevelt and robert la follette truman , leading the latter to decide not to run for another term vice president hubert humphrey secured the presidential nomination despite not winning a single primary under his own name after this , a democratic national committee-commissioned panel led by senator george mcgovern – the mcgovern–fraser commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , obama faced no major challenger in the democratic party primaries since he had the advantage of incumbency ( see below ) , while mitt romney gained enough delegates to be declared the presumptive republican nominee by late april this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016 : primaries and caucuses can not start until february 1 ; and only iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and nevada are entitled to february contests on the other hand , as stated above , the primaries and caucuses are non-governmental party affairs in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states an incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party 's primaries , especially if they are still popular during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter bush during the 1992 republican primaries , but only received a handful of delegates ; bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to clinton both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate republicans have three at-large delegates selected at the state convention from all the states and territories , 168 in number in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses jeff naft , the reason why dozens of lobbyists will be democratic presidential delegates , abc news ( february 29 , 2016 ) the party voted in favor of superdelegate reform , such that in future presidential elections most superdelegates will be bound to their state primary results david weigel , democrats vote to bind most superdelegates to state primary results , washington post ( july 23 , 2016 ) franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses another is that most election laws do not normally apply to caucuses nearly all states have a binding primary or caucus , in which the results of the election depending on state law or party rules legally bind some or all of the delegates to vote for a particular candidate at the national convention , for a certain number of ballots or until the candidate releases the delegates in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates a handful of states may also practice non-binding '' beauty contests '' , which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention , which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote in an open primary , any voter may vote in any party 's primary a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in in all of these systems , a voter may participate in only one primary ;

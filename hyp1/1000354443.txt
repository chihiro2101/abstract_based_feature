there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington hamilton and madison , who wrote the aforementioned federalist papers against political factions , ended up being the core leaders in this partisanship : hamilton became the leader of federalist party while madison co-helmed the democratic-republican party with thomas jefferson richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate this convention was held in baltimore on september 26 , 1831 which selected william wirt as their presidential candidate delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates ; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent progressive era reformers looked to the primary election as a way to measure popular opinion of candidates , as opposed to the opinion of the bosses florida enacted the first presidential primary in 1901 in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both by 1920 there were 20 states with primaries , but some went back , and from 1936 to 1968 , 12 states used them seeking to boost voter turnout , new hampshire simplified its ballot access laws in 1949 in the ensuing non-binding '' beauty contest '' of 1952 , republican dwight eisenhower demonstrated his broad voter appeal by out-polling the favored robert a the first-in-the-nation new hampshire primary has since become a widely observed test of candidates ' viability after this , a democratic national committee-commissioned panel led by senator george mcgovern – the mcgovern–fraser commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation a large number of states , faced with the need to conform to more detailed rules for the selection of national delegates , chose a presidential primary as an easier way to come into compliance with the new national democratic party rules the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process another trend is to stage earlier and earlier primaries , given impetus by super tuesday and the mid-1990s move ( since repealed ) of the california primary and its bloc of votes—the largest in the nation—from june to march to retain its tradition as the first primary in the country ( and adhere to a state law which requires it to be ) , new hampshire moved their primary forward , from early march to early january a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , obama faced no major challenger in the democratic party primaries since he had the advantage of incumbency ( see below ) , while mitt romney gained enough delegates to be declared the presumptive republican nominee by late april in response , other states also changed their primary election dates for 2012 , in order to claim a greater influence , creating a cascade of changes in other states this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016 : primaries and caucuses can not start until february 1 ; and only iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and nevada are entitled to february contests both the democratic and republican parties , as well as other third parties , have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states an incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party 's primaries , especially if they are still popular senator ted kennedy then carried 12 states while running against carter during the 1980 democratic party primaries ; reagan then defeated carter in the fall each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party 's bylaws these are each states ' two national committeepersons and the state chairperson in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses some superdelegates are former or current state or federal lobbyists in 2016 , following a push by senator bernie sanders , burgess everett & seung min kim , sanders ' anti-superdelegate push gains steam in senate , politico ( june 21 , 2016 ) franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses instead of going to a polling place , voters attend local private events run by the political parties , and cast their selections there one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary in some states , a semi-closed primary is practiced , in which voters unaffiliated with a party ( independents ) may choose a party primary in which to vote a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory since the 2012 democratic primaries , the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 u.s states and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates as a result , states variously applied the statewide winner-take-all method ( e.g eight years later , in the 1988 republican presidential nomination battle , bush , serving as reagan 's vice president , unexpectedly finished third in iowa which bob dole won in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention it would still allow states to determine the timing of their own primaries , while giving them some incentive to hold primaries later '' first-in-the-nation presidential primary '' , state of new hampshire manual for the general court , ( department of state ) no.55 , 1997

there is no provision for the role of political parties in the united states constitution , since the founding fathers did not originally intend for american politics to be partisan thus in the first two presidential elections , the electoral college handled the nominations and elections in 1789 and 1792 that selected george washington richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates before 1820 , democratic-republican members of congress would nominate a single candidate from their party the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate this convention was held in baltimore on september 26 , 1831 which selected william wirt as their presidential candidate delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions sometimes they were dominated by intrigue between political bosses who controlled delegates ; the national convention was far from democratic or transparent the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both by 1920 there were 20 states with primaries , but some went back , and from 1936 to 1968 , 12 states used them the impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the chaotic 1968 democratic national convention after this , a democratic national committee-commissioned panel led by senator george mcgovern – the mcgovern–fraser commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process the 1988 presidential election in the south : continuity amidst change in southern party politics ( 1991 ) pp 3–20 it failed as all but two of the eight major candidates won at least one primary on that day to retain its tradition as the first primary in the country ( and adhere to a state law which requires it to be ) , new hampshire moved their primary forward , from early march to early january a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , obama faced no major challenger in the democratic party primaries since he had the advantage of incumbency ( see below ) , while mitt romney gained enough delegates to be declared the presumptive republican nominee by late april this followed what happened in 2008 when nevada moved its caucuses to january , causing other states to also move their primaries to earlier dates both the democratic and republican parties , as well as other third parties , have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process with the lack of serious competition , the incumbent president 's party may also cancel several state primaries/caucuses to both save money and to show undivided support for the incumbent 's candidacy during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions each of these conventions is attended by a number of delegates selected in accordance with the given party 's bylaws both parties also have a group of unpledged delegates these are each states ' two national committeepersons and the state chairperson in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses , senators and representatives ) , former and current democratic presidents and vice presidents , and a few leaders of democratic national committee-affiliated organizations , such as the young democrats of america ) who can vote for whomever they wish jeff naft , the reason why dozens of lobbyists will be democratic presidential delegates , abc news ( february 29 , 2016 ) the party voted in favor of superdelegate reform , such that in future presidential elections most superdelegates will be bound to their state primary results david weigel , democrats vote to bind most superdelegates to state primary results , washington post ( july 23 , 2016 ) . types of primaries and caucuses while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses instead of going to a polling place , voters attend local private events run by the political parties , and cast their selections there one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them another is that most election laws do not normally apply to caucuses some binding primaries are winner-take-all contests , in which all of a state 's delegates are required to vote for the same candidate in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district some states may use a binding walking subcaucus system , where voters may instead be choosing pledged delegates to a local , county or state party convention , which then in turn selects pledged delegates to the national convention each delegation announces its vote tallies , usually accompanied with some boosterism of their state or territory thus , presidential candidates officially announce their intentions to run that early so they can start raising or spending the money needed to mount their nationwide campaigns during the first six months of the year , primaries and caucuses are separately held in each of the 50 states ; the washington , d.c however , to reduce expenses and encourage turnout , the major parties ' primaries are usually held the same day and may be consolidated with other state elections the primary election itself is administered by local governments according to state law the first binding event , in which a candidate can secure convention delegates , is traditionally the iowa caucus , usually held in late january or early february of the presidential election year it is generally followed by the new hampshire primary , the first primary by tradition since 1920 and by new hampshire state law '' the iowa caucuses are not considered to be '' a similar election '' under new hampshire 's law because the former uses caucuses instead of primary elections for example , during the 2012 republican primary , florida and several other states still moved their primaries to earlier dates despite being penalized delegates for republicans , states with more than 30 delegates that violate the timing rules will be deprived of all their delegates but nine ; states with less than 30 will be reduced to six for democrats , states violating these rules will be penalized half of their pledged delegates and all of their unpledged delegates

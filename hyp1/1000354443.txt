hamilton and madison , who wrote the aforementioned federalist papers against political factions , ended up being the core leaders in this partisanship : hamilton became the leader of federalist party while madison co-helmed the democratic-republican party with thomas jefferson richard hofstadter , the idea of a party system : the rise of legitimate opposition in the united states , 1780–1840 ( 1970 ) gordon s wood , empire of liberty : a history of the early republic , 1789–1815 ( oxford history of the united states ) starting with the 1796 election , congressional party or a state legislature party caucus selected the party 's presidential candidates the first national convention was called by the anti-masonic party in 1831 , as they could not use the caucus system because they had no congressmen the party leaders instead called for a national meeting of supporters to set the party 's candidate this convention was held in baltimore on september 26 , 1831 which selected william wirt as their presidential candidate delegates to the national convention were usually selected at state conventions whose own delegates were chosen by district conventions the wisconsin direct open primary of 1905 was the first to eliminate the caucus and mandate direct selection of national convention delegates in 1910 , oregon became the first state to establish a presidential preference primary , which requires delegates to the national convention to support the winner of the primary at the convention by 1912 , twelve states either selected delegates in primaries , used a preferential primary , or both by 1920 there were 20 states with primaries , but some went back , and from 1936 to 1968 , 12 states used them the impetus for national adoption of the binding primary election was the chaotic 1968 democratic national convention after this , a democratic national committee-commissioned panel led by senator george mcgovern – the mcgovern–fraser commission – recommended that states adopt new rules to assure wider participation the result was that many more future delegates would be selected by a state presidential primary the republicans also adopted many more state presidential primaries with the broadened use of the primary system , states have tried to increase their influence in the nomination process the first regional primary was the southern super tuesday of march 8 , 1988 , in which nine states united in the idea that a candidate would reflect regional interests another trend is to stage earlier and earlier primaries , given impetus by super tuesday and the mid-1990s move ( since repealed ) of the california primary and its bloc of votes—the largest in the nation—from june to march to retain its tradition as the first primary in the country ( and adhere to a state law which requires it to be ) , new hampshire moved their primary forward , from early march to early january a major reason states try to increase their influence , and vie for earlier primaries , is that in recent years the races have usually been decided before the primary season has ended in june for example , john mccain officially clinched the 2008 republican presidential nomination in march , while during that same month barack obama held a substantial lead in pledged delegates in the democratic party primaries in 2012 , both the republicans and the democrats moved their florida primary to january 31 , which was an earlier date than past election cycles both parties then enacted stricter timing rules for 2016 : primaries and caucuses can not start until february 1 ; and only iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and nevada are entitled to february contests both the democratic and republican parties , as well as other third parties , have agreed to let these territories participate in the presidential nomination process in the two major party 's rules , '' territories '' are referred to as '' states '' , which can be carried over in discussion and media implying there are more than 50 states an incumbent president seeking re-election usually faces no opposition during their respective party 's primaries , especially if they are still popular with the lack of serious competition , the incumbent president 's party may also cancel several state primaries/caucuses to both save money and to show undivided support for the incumbent 's candidacy during the 1976 republican party primaries , then-former california governor reagan carried 23 states while running against incumbent president gerald ford ; ford then went on to lose the presidential election to jimmy carter bush during the 1992 republican primaries , but only received a handful of delegates ; bush too subsequently went on to lose in the general election to clinton both major political parties of the u.s.—the democratic party and the republican party—officially nominate their candidate for president at their respective national conventions the results of the presidential primaries and caucuses bind many of these delegates , known as pledged delegates , to vote for a particular candidate in democratic primaries through 2016 , about 85 % of delegates to the democratic national convention are '' pledged delegates '' who are apportioned to candidates according to the results of primaries and caucuses the party voted in favor of superdelegate reform , such that in future presidential elections most superdelegates will be bound to their state primary results . types of primaries and caucuses franchise in a primary or caucus is governed by rules established by the state party , although the states may impose other regulations while most states hold primary elections , a handful of states hold caucuses one disadvantage of caucuses is that the state party runs the process directly instead of having the state and local governments run them some binding primaries are winner-take-all contests , in which all of a state 's delegates are required to vote for the same candidate in a proportional vote , a state 's delegation is allocated in proportion to the candidates ' percent of the popular vote in a congressional district in many of those states that have proportional vote primaries , a candidate must meet a certain threshold in the popular vote to be given delegates a handful of states may also practice non-binding '' beauty contests '' , which are public opinion surveys for use by caucus delegates to select candidates to a state convention , which then in turn selects delegates to the national convention in many states , only voters registered with a party may vote in that party 's primary , known as a closed primary a semi-open primary occurs when a voter must choose a party-specific ballot to cast , instead of being provided a single ballot where the voter must choose on the ballot itself which party 's primary to vote in a few states once staged a blanket primary , in which voters could vote for one candidate in multiple primaries , but the practice was struck down by the u.s both the democratic party and the republican party usually modify their delegate selection rules between presidential elections , including how delegates are allocated to each state and territory under the current democratic party selection rules , adopted in 2006 , pledged delegates are selected under proportional representation , which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15 % of a state 's popular vote to receive delegates each state publishes a delegate selection plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district , and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention since the 2012 democratic primaries , the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 u.s states and territories who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates '' the iowa caucuses are not considered to be '' a similar election '' under new hampshire 's law because the former uses caucuses instead of primary elections from its inception in 1980 through the election of 2008 , the winner of the south carolina republican presidential primary has gone on to win the nomination conversely , states that traditionally hold their primaries in june , like california ( the most populous state overall ) and new jersey ( the most densely populated state ) , usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidate will be in a 24-year cycle , every state would have a chance to be among the first primary states in the 2008 republican primary , states that ran early primaries were punished by a reduction of 50 % in the number of delegates they could send to the national convention for republicans , states with more than 30 delegates that violate the timing rules will be deprived of all their delegates but nine ; states with less than 30 will be reduced to six

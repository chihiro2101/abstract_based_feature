in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc , the monarch generally possesses reserve powers there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure using these powers in contravention of tradition would generally provoke a constitutional crisis most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt , believe or believed that reserve powers are vestigial and potentially open to abuse evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis campbell initially refused to redistribute ministerial portfolios on the sole advice of the premier , who lacked the confidence of his cabinet owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign king george vi in 1947 issued letters patent permitting the governor general '' to exercise all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to us the monarch in respect of canada on the second occasion , which took place in 1925 and came to be known as the king-byng affair , prime minister william lyon mackenzie king , facing a non-confidence motion in the house of commons , advised the governor general , the viscount byng of vimy , to dissolve the new parliament , but byng refused at the provincial level , on 29 june 2017 lieutenant governor of british columbia judith guichon used her reserve powers to deny the request of premier christy clark to dissolve the legislature and call a new election only 51 days after the recent provincial election guichon refused this advice and instead asked john horgan to form a government , becoming the new premier peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers new zealand 's early governors , the predecessors of today 's governors-general , exercised considerable power , with exclusive authority over some matters such as foreign and māori affairs the governor-general has a number of reserve powers , which he or she may use on behalf of queen elizabeth ii sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation this power is exercised every time a general election results in a change of government , most recently in 2017 finally , it may happen if a prime minister is manoeuvred out of his position by his own party , retires or resigns for personal reasons , or dies in office the governor-general may dismiss an incumbent prime minister and cabinet , an individual minister , or any other official who holds office '' during the queen 's pleasure '' or '' during the governor-general 's pleasure '' conventionally , the governor-general follows the advice of the prime minister or another appropriate minister in matters of appointment and dismissal likewise , by convention , the government as a whole remains in office as long as it keeps the confidence of the house however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers if a defeated prime minister refuses to do either of these two things , the governor-general could use the reserve powers to either dismiss the prime minister ( see above ) , or dissolve parliament without the prime minister 's advice a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed on 3 july , italeli exercised his reserve powers in ordering parliament to convene , against the prime minister 's wishes , on 30 july in the uk , the monarch has numerous theoretical personal prerogatives , but beyond the appointment of a prime minister , there are in practice few circumstances in modern british government where these prerogatives could be justifiably exercised ; they have rarely been exercised in the last century in 1999 , queen elizabeth ii , acting on the advice of the government , refused to signify her consent to the military action against iraq ( parliamentary approval ) bill , which sought to transfer from the monarch to parliament the power to authorise military strikes against iraq these powers could be exercised in an emergency such as a constitutional crisis ( such as surrounded the people 's budget of 1909 ) or in wartime for example , in the hung parliament in 1974 , the serving prime minister , edward heath , attempted to remain in power but was unable to form a working majority no provision within the constitution invests the king with the ability to veto legislation directly , however no provision prohibits the king from withholding royal assent , effectively a veto however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice

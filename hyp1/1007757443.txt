, the monarch generally possesses reserve powers there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure using these powers in contravention of tradition would generally provoke a constitutional crisis most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself evatt , believe or believed that reserve powers are vestigial and potentially open to abuse evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers all members of the government then signed the bill , passing it into law the government declared that baudouin was capable of reigning again the next day within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence by the time the oath was abolished by the irish parliament in 1933 , the irish governor-general was formally advised exclusively by the irish government cited in geoff barlow & jf corkery , '' sir walter campbell queensland governor and his role in premier joh bjelke-petersen 's resignation , 1987 '' , 23 owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence , introduction by eugene forsey , in evatt and forsey on the reserve powers , ed the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign clark had advised guichon to dissolve the legislature as , in her view , the appointment of a speaker would have resulted in frequent tie votes and an untenable position '' the honourable john c peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers '' further , eugene forsey stated '' the reserve power is indeed , under our constitution , an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation this power is exercised every time a general election results in a change of government , most recently in 2017 finally , it may happen if a prime minister is manoeuvred out of his position by his own party , retires or resigns for personal reasons , or dies in office today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general conventionally , the governor-general follows the advice of the prime minister or another appropriate minister in matters of appointment and dismissal likewise , by convention , the government as a whole remains in office as long as it keeps the confidence of the house however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers if a defeated prime minister refuses to do either of these two things , the governor-general could use the reserve powers to either dismiss the prime minister ( see above ) , or dissolve parliament without the prime minister 's advice a governor-general can also refuse a prime minister 's request to dissolve parliament and hold elections see the lascelles principles for factors which might guide the governor-general in making a decision on whether or not to grant a dissolution in those circumstances though these remained the same in law for the time being , later governors and governments considered that there would be far fewer scenarios in which their use would be appropriate a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister or ( e ) in his own deliberate judgment ( in which case he shall exercise an independent discretion ) '' on 28 june , prime minister willy telavi 's government had lost a crucial by-election , which gave the opposition a majority of one in parliament the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed subsequently , wilson asked that if the government were defeated on the floor of the house of commons , the queen would grant a dissolution , which she agreed to unlike most other constitutional monarchs , the emperor of japan has no reserve powers reserve powers can also be written into a republican constitution that separates the offices of head of state and head of government article 16 rule has only been exercised once , in 1961 , during a crisis related to the algerian war in which charles de gaulle needed those emergency powers to foil a military plot to take over the government however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice separation of powers of state into separate branches , normally an executive , a legislature , and a judiciary westminster system donald

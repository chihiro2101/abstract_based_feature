in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc typically these powers are : to grant pardon ; to dismiss a prime minister ; to refuse to dissolve parliament ; and to refuse or delay royal assent to legislation ( to withhold royal assent amounts to a veto of a bill , while to reserve royal assent in effect amounts to a decision to neither grant nor refuse assent , but to delay taking a decision for an undetermined period ) in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself evatt , believe or believed that reserve powers are vestigial and potentially open to abuse in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in legal terminology , a competence vested in 'the king ' thus very often means the government , as opposed to formal laws which require a ( sometimes qualified ) parliamentary majority constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis on 11 november 1975 , when the governor-general of australia sir john kerr 1975 australian constitutional crisis in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen campbell initially refused to redistribute ministerial portfolios on the sole advice of the premier , who lacked the confidence of his cabinet subsequently , during a period when queensland had a '' premier who is not leader '' and the governing party had a '' leader who is not premier '' , peter bowers and greg roberts , ‘ ahern leads , but joh rules ’ , sydney morning herald , 27 november 1987 owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign '' the reserve power of dismissal has never been used in canada , although other reserve powers have been employed to force the prime minister to resign on two occasions : the first took place in 1896 , when the prime minister , sir charles tupper , refused to step down after his party did not win a majority in the house of commons during that year 's election , leading governor general the earl of aberdeen to no longer recognize tupper as prime minister and disapprove of several appointments tupper had recommended on the second occasion , which took place in 1925 and came to be known as the king-byng affair , prime minister william lyon mackenzie king , facing a non-confidence motion in the house of commons , advised the governor general , the viscount byng of vimy , to dissolve the new parliament , but byng refused at the provincial level , on 29 june 2017 lieutenant governor of british columbia judith guichon used her reserve powers to deny the request of premier christy clark to dissolve the legislature and call a new election only 51 days after the recent provincial election peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers they also had a real choice in selecting premiers – parliaments of the period being composed of independent members who formed loose and shifting factions – and were not always obliged to act on the advice of their ministers the governor-general has a number of reserve powers , which he or she may use on behalf of queen elizabeth ii the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation the governor-general retains the theoretical power to appoint as prime minister a member of the house of representatives who clearly does not have the support of a majority of mps , but no governor-general has sought to use this power since new zealand gained responsible government , though some cabinets in the 19th century proved extremely short-lived in earlier times , if a prime minister died , became incapacitated , or resigned unexpectedly , a governor-general might be able to choose a temporary prime minister from among several senior ministers , while the governing party decided on a new leader who would then be duly appointed prime minister today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general likewise , by convention , the government as a whole remains in office as long as it keeps the confidence of the house the governor-general can also dissolve parliament and call elections without prime ministerial advice however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the house will conventionally either advise a dissolution of parliament and new elections , or tender his resignation likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice if a prime minister has been defeated by a vote of no confidence , a refusal by the governor-general to dissolve parliament would , in effect , force the prime minister to resign and make way for a successor a governor-general could also legally refuse a request for a snap election from a prime minister in whom the house has confidence , but such a refusal would be extremely unlikely there have been a handful of occasions when reserve powers were used , or at least considered though these remained the same in law for the time being , later governors and governments considered that there would be far fewer scenarios in which their use would be appropriate the outgoing prime minister , sir rob muldoon , had just lost an election , but refused to advise the governor-general , david beattie , to make urgent regulations desired not only by the incoming prime minister , david lange , but also by many in muldoon 's own party and cabinet on 28 june , prime minister willy telavi 's government had lost a crucial by-election , which gave the opposition a majority of one in parliament the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed '' tuvalu ’ s opposition waiting to hear from gg '' , islands business , 1 july 2013 prime minister telavi responded that , under the constitution , he was only required to convene parliament once a year ( for a vote on the budget ) , and was thus under no obligation to summon it until december '' parliament needs one yearly meeting only says defiant tuvalu pm '' , radio new zealand international , 2 july 2013 the opposition turned to the governor-general title iv government and administration section 99 ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) ( 1 ) after each renewal of the congress and the other cases provided for under the constitution , the king shall , after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation , and through the speaker of the congress , nominate for the presidency of the government reserve powers can also be written into a republican constitution that separates the offices of head of state and head of government however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice the president may convene a special committee to resolve questions of privilege between the dáil and the seanad with regard to money bills , and with regard to speeding the passage of urgent bills through the seanad separation of powers of state into separate branches , normally an executive , a legislature , and a judiciary

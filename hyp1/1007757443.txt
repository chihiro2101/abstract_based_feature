in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown constitutional precedence has even established the unwritten but binding rule that the monarch must give assent to any parliamentary decision , regardless of any other considerations ( which can only be advanced in private audience with government members , not imposed ) , as soon as the government presents it for royal signature and thus assumes full political responsibility instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis on 11 november 1975 , when the governor-general of australia sir john kerr 1975 australian constitutional crisis in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen the reserve powers in canada fall within the royal prerogative and belong specifically to the monarch , as the constitution act , 1867 , vests all executive power in the country 's sovereign on the second occasion , which took place in 1925 and came to be known as the king-byng affair , prime minister william lyon mackenzie king , facing a non-confidence motion in the house of commons , advised the governor general , the viscount byng of vimy , to dissolve the new parliament , but byng refused peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers '' further , eugene forsey stated '' the reserve power is indeed , under our constitution , an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy it takes the place of the legal and judicial safeguards provided in the united states by written constitutions , enforceable in the courts sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 finally , it may happen if a prime minister is manoeuvred out of his position by his own party , retires or resigns for personal reasons , or dies in office though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general conventionally , the governor-general follows the advice of the prime minister or another appropriate minister in matters of appointment and dismissal the governor-general can also dissolve parliament and call elections without prime ministerial advice however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the house will conventionally either advise a dissolution of parliament and new elections , or tender his resignation if a defeated prime minister refuses to do either of these two things , the governor-general could use the reserve powers to either dismiss the prime minister ( see above ) , or dissolve parliament without the prime minister 's advice likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice a governor-general can also refuse a prime minister 's request to dissolve parliament and hold elections in the 1890s , premier john ballance advised the governor to make several new appointments to the ( since abolished ) legislative council this incident markedly reduced the discretionary powers of the governor though these remained the same in law for the time being , later governors and governments considered that there would be far fewer scenarios in which their use would be appropriate a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister in 2013 , governor-general iakoba italeli was requested by the opposition to act without ( and indeed against ) the prime minister 's advice the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed '' tuvalu ’ s opposition waiting to hear from gg '' , islands business , 1 july 2013 prime minister telavi responded that , under the constitution , he was only required to convene parliament once a year ( for a vote on the budget ) , and was thus under no obligation to summon it until december '' tuvalu ’ s parliament convenes july 30 '' , islands business , 3 july 2013 in october 2003 the government made public the following prerogatives but it said at the time that a comprehensive catalogue of prerogative powers could not be supplied : to refuse to dissolve parliament when requested by the prime minister harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority however , he made no move to put away his reserve powers after he himself became president however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice however , prior to their exercise , the president is bound , in most cases , to consult the council of state , an advisory body consisting of a mixture of senior ex-officio and nominated members

using these powers in contravention of tradition would generally provoke a constitutional crisis most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt , believe or believed that reserve powers are vestigial and potentially open to abuse evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so all members of the government then signed the bill , passing it into law the government declared that baudouin was capable of reigning again the next day within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence for example , the first governor-general of the irish free state , tim healy , was instructed by the british dominions office in 1922 to withhold the royal assent on any bill passed by the two houses of the oireachtas ( the irish parliament ) that attempted to change or abolish the oath of allegiance by the time the oath was abolished by the irish parliament in 1933 , the irish governor-general was formally advised exclusively by the irish government while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis in both cases an election was held very soon afterwards and , again in both cases , the dismissed government was massively defeated by popular vote in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence donald markwell , '' griffith , barton and the early governor-generals : aspects of australia 's constitutional development '' , public law review , 1999 clark had advised guichon to dissolve the legislature as , in her view , the appointment of a speaker would have resulted in frequent tie votes and an untenable position peter hogg , a constitutional scholar , has opined that '' a system of responsible government can not work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers they also had a real choice in selecting premiers – parliaments of the period being composed of independent members who formed loose and shifting factions – and were not always obliged to act on the advice of their ministers as new zealand 's political system matured , the colonial office increasingly instructed the governors to follow the advice of local ministers , and the powers of the office have continually shrunk sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 finally , it may happen if a prime minister is manoeuvred out of his position by his own party , retires or resigns for personal reasons , or dies in office though the power of appointment is listed among the reserve powers , in fact the governor-general abides by strict conventions , and has always appointed the leader of the dominant party in the house of representatives today , however , the practice of appointing – on prime ministerial advice – a permanent deputy prime minister , who becomes acting prime minister when needed , has largely removed even this discretion from the governor-general conventionally , the governor-general follows the advice of the prime minister or another appropriate minister in matters of appointment and dismissal if a defeated prime minister refuses to do either of these two things , the governor-general could use the reserve powers to either dismiss the prime minister ( see above ) , or dissolve parliament without the prime minister 's advice likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice if a prime minister has been defeated by a vote of no confidence , a refusal by the governor-general to dissolve parliament would , in effect , force the prime minister to resign and make way for a successor a governor-general could also legally refuse a request for a snap election from a prime minister in whom the house has confidence , but such a refusal would be extremely unlikely others , such as professor philip joseph , believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse royal assent to bills in exceptional circumstances - such as the abolition of democracy there have been a handful of occasions when reserve powers were used , or at least considered this incident markedly reduced the discretionary powers of the governor a constitutional crisis occurred in saint kitts and nevis in 1981 , when the governor , sir probyn inniss , used his reserve powers to refuse assent to a bill passed by the government of sir kennedy simmonds , the country 's premier in 2013 , governor-general iakoba italeli was requested by the opposition to act without ( and indeed against ) the prime minister 's advice the opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament , so that a motion of no confidence could be introduced , and a new government formed on 3 july , italeli exercised his reserve powers in ordering parliament to convene , against the prime minister 's wishes , on 30 july harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority these powers could be exercised in an emergency such as a constitutional crisis ( such as surrounded the people 's budget of 1909 ) or in wartime reserve powers can also be written into a republican constitution that separates the offices of head of state and head of government the president of ireland does not possess executive powers : executive powers are held by the government , which is headed by a taoiseach ( prime minister ) , who is chosen by and accountable to dáil éireann ( house of representatives ) in addition to these powers , the president has various other discretionary powers in the constitution , which are of lesser political significance ( in normal circumstances )

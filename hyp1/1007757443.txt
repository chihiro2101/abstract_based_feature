in monarchies with either an uncodified or partly unwritten constitution ( such as the united kingdom or canada ) or a wholly written constitution that consists of a text augmented by additional conventions , traditions , letters patent , etc , the monarch generally possesses reserve powers there are usually strict constitutional conventions concerning when these powers may be used , and these conventions are enforced by public pressure using these powers in contravention of tradition would generally provoke a constitutional crisis most constitutional monarchies employ a system that includes the principle of responsible government in such an order , the reserve powers are thought to be the means by which the monarch and his or her viceregal representatives can legitimately exist as '' constitutional guardians '' or '' umpires '' , tasked with guaranteeing that cabinet and parliament adhere to the fundamental constitutional principles of the rule of law and responsible government itself some constitutional scholars , such as george winterton , have stated that reserve powers are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of reserve powers allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution evatt felt that the reserve powers could be codified and still serve their intended function in a responsible government system , as they do in ireland , japan , and sweden in belgium a constitutional provision explicitly states that no act of the monarch is valid without the signature of a member or members of the government , which thereby becomes solely responsible , hence excluding any reserve power for the crown in 1990 , when a law liberalising belgium 's abortion laws was approved by parliament , king baudouin refused to give his royal assent , only the second time in belgium 's history the monarch elected to do so instead , he requested that the cabinet declare him unable to reign for a day , which it did , thereby assuming the king 's constitutional powers within the dominions , until the 1920s , most reserve powers were exercised by a governor-general on the advice of either the local or the british government , though the latter took precedence after the balfour declaration was produced by the 1926 imperial conference , formally establishing the autonomy and equal status of commonwealth governments , governors-general ceased to be advised in any way by the british government by the time the oath was abolished by the irish parliament in 1933 , the irish governor-general was formally advised exclusively by the irish government while the reserve power to dismiss a government has not been used in the united kingdom since 1834 , this power has been exercised more recently in australia , on two occasions : on 13 may 1932 , when the governor of new south wales philip game lang dismissal crisis in queensland in 1987 , during a tense period of leadership succession , the governor of queensland , sir walter campbell , exercised reserve power in declining to follow the advice of the premier , sir joh bjelke-petersen cited in geoff barlow & jf corkery , '' sir walter campbell queensland governor and his role in premier joh bjelke-petersen 's resignation , 1987 '' , 23 owen dixon society ejournal ( gold coast , queensland : bond university , 2007 ) there was speculation on the potential exercise of vice-regal reserve power by campbell , in dismissing the premier in the absence of a parliamentary motion of no confidence barlow & corkery '' sir walter campbell '' , 28-29 these are among several exercises of the reserve powers in australia in the 20th century at state and federal levels donald markwell , '' griffith , barton and the early governor-generals : aspects of australia 's constitutional development '' , public law review , 1999 king george vi in 1947 issued letters patent permitting the governor general '' to exercise all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to us the monarch in respect of canada clark had advised guichon to dissolve the legislature as , in her view , the appointment of a speaker would have resulted in frequent tie votes and an untenable position guichon refused this advice and instead asked john horgan to form a government , becoming the new premier new zealand 's early governors , the predecessors of today 's governors-general , exercised considerable power , with exclusive authority over some matters such as foreign and māori affairs the governor-general has a number of reserve powers , which he or she may use on behalf of queen elizabeth ii sir kenneth keith describes the use of these powers as based on the principle that '' the queen reigns , but the government rules , so long as it has the support of the house of representatives '' the most visible reserve powers are the power to appoint a prime minister and the related power to accept a prime minister 's resignation it may also be exercised if a prime minister no-confidence motion and resigns instead of advising a dissolution of parliament ; the last such occasion was in 1912 the governor-general can also dissolve parliament and call elections without prime ministerial advice dissolving parliament and calling for elections is part of the governor-general 's normal duties ; every parliamentary dissolution and subsequent general election in new zealand 's history has been called by the governor or governor-general however , all elections since responsible government was introduced , including snap elections , have been requested by the incumbent premier or prime minister , and are accordingly not examples of use of the reserve powers likewise , if the prime minister tenders his resignation , the governor-general could theoretically refuse to accept it , and dissolve parliament against the prime minister 's advice see the lascelles principles for factors which might guide the governor-general in making a decision on whether or not to grant a dissolution in those circumstances the outgoing prime minister , sir rob muldoon , had just lost an election , but refused to advise the governor-general , david beattie , to make urgent regulations desired not only by the incoming prime minister , david lange , but also by many in muldoon 's own party and cabinet muldoon eventually relented under pressure from his own cabinet , making the use of beattie 's reserve powers unnecessary the constitution of tuvalu provides , in article 52 , that the governor-general exercises his powers '' only in accordance with the advice of ( a ) the cabinet ; or ( b ) the prime minister in october 2003 the government made public the following prerogatives but it said at the time that a comprehensive catalogue of prerogative powers could not be supplied : to refuse to dissolve parliament when requested by the prime minister harold wilson , leading a minority government in 1974 , was advised elizabeth ii might refuse to dissolve parliament if she could identify an alternative prime minister able to command a cross-party majority this was last done in britain in 1963 when elizabeth ii appointed sir alec douglas-home as prime minister , on the advice of outgoing harold macmillan to be informed of the affairs of state and , for this purpose , to preside over the meetings of the council of ministers whenever , he sees fit , at the president of the government 's request reserve powers may include , for instance , the right to issue emergency legislation or regulation bypassing the normal processes in his book , le coup d'état permanent ( the permanent coup ) , françois mitterrand criticized article 16 for allowing an ambitious politician the opportunity to become a dictator article 81 of the german constitution states the possibility that the president can by this means keep a government capable of action even in case of loss of a constructive majority in the bundestag however , the president has certain reserve powers , also known as '' discretionary powers '' in ireland , which can be exercised by the president at his or her discretion – without , or even contrary to , the government 's advice separation of powers of state into separate branches , normally an executive , a legislature , and a judiciary westminster system donald markwell eugene forsey george winterton h

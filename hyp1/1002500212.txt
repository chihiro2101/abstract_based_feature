cromwell devised a new election that would be called by the king at a time of the king 's choosing in the united states , these contests have been called '' special elections '' because they do not always occur on election day like regular congressional elections special elections are held when a seat in the house of representatives , state legislature , or local legislature becomes vacant constitution requires that vacancies in the house of representatives be filled with a special election ( unlike the senate , where it is up to law of the state involved to determine how the vacancy is filled ) in most cases where a vacancy is filled through a special election , a primary will also be held to determine which candidates will represent the major parties when one seat in a proportional representation constituency becomes vacant , the consequences vary for example , a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy or all the seats in the constituency could be contested in the by-election this usually occurs if a vacancy arises shortly before a planned general election ( within six months in new zealand ) in both countries , by-elections where voters elect their preferred candidate are only used to fill a vacancy in a constituency seat if that candidate has died or declines the seat , it is offered to subsequent candidates on the list until one accepts the seat in the german bundestag , which uses mixed-member proportional representation , by-elections were originally held upon the vacancy of any constituency seat , in the same manner as scotland and new zealand this was changed in january 1953 , since which time vacancies in constituency seats have been filled by the next candidate on the state list of the party which won the seat , in the same manner as vacancies among list seats by-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it â€“ typically , if the former member was elected as an independent for example , andrea horwath 's win in an ontario provincial by-election in 2004 allowed the ontario new democratic party to regain official party status with important results in terms of parliamentary privileges and funding political scientists generally caution against overinterpreting by-election results , which non-experts often take as a bellwether or early indicator of the results of the next general election a 2016 study of special elections to the united states house of representatives found '' that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes , presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well the media called it a '' mini-election '' , a test of the liberal government 's popularity with a general election due in less than a year the pro-democracy camp was considered safe in de facto first past the post by-election because both pro-democracy camp and pro-beijing camp would only nominate one candidate to fill in the by-election in 1965 the british foreign secretary patrick gordon walker stood in the leyton by-election for election to the uk parliament , having been defeated in controversial circumstances in smethwick at the previous year 's general election

the procedure for filling a vacant seat in the house of commons of england was developed during the reformation parliament of the 16th century by thomas cromwell ; previously a seat had remained empty upon the death of a member 36 during the parliaments of charles ii , which reached up to 18 years in length , by-elections were the primary means by which new members entered the house of commons ucl press , london in the united states , these contests have been called '' special elections '' because they do not always occur on election day like regular congressional elections special elections are held when a seat in the house of representatives , state legislature , or local legislature becomes vacant constitution requires that vacancies in the house of representatives be filled with a special election ( unlike the senate , where it is up to law of the state involved to determine how the vacancy is filled ) in most cases where a vacancy is filled through a special election , a primary will also be held to determine which candidates will represent the major parties when one seat in a proportional representation constituency becomes vacant , the consequences vary for example , a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy or all the seats in the constituency could be contested in the by-election alternatives to holding a by-election include : choosing from those losing candidates at the previous election who choose to contest the recount to fill the vacancy , as in tasmania or the australian capital territory , keeping the seat vacant until the next general election this usually occurs if a vacancy arises shortly before a planned general election ( within six months in new zealand ) for example , the death of donald dewar resulted in a by-election for the constituency of glasgow anniesland the republic of ireland holds by-elections despite electing members in multi-member constituencies by the single transferable vote by-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it â€“ typically , if the former member was elected as an independent since no independents have been elected to the bundestag since the first legislative period , no such substitute election has ever taken place in the united states senate , scott brown 's election in 2010 ended the filibuster-proof supermajority formerly enjoyed by democrats the media called it a '' mini-election '' , a test of the liberal government 's popularity with a general election due in less than a year as a result , with confidence in his government undermined , prime minister william lyon mackenzie king called the 1945 federal election several weeks later ; originally he had intended to postpone the election until the war was clearly won in 1965 the british foreign secretary patrick gordon walker stood in the leyton by-election for election to the uk parliament , having been defeated in controversial circumstances in smethwick at the previous year 's general election

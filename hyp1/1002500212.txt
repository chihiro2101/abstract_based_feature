cromwell devised a new election that would be called by the king at a time of the king 's choosing in the united states , these contests have been called '' special elections '' because they do not always occur on election day like regular congressional elections special elections are held when a seat in the house of representatives , state legislature , or local legislature becomes vacant in most cases where a vacancy is filled through a special election , a primary will also be held to determine which candidates will represent the major parties for example , a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy or all the seats in the constituency could be contested in the by-election alternatives to holding a by-election include : choosing from those losing candidates at the previous election who choose to contest the recount to fill the vacancy , as in tasmania or the australian capital territory , keeping the seat vacant until the next general election scotland and new zealand still hold by-elections , despite having adopted the mixed-member proportional representation system , in which some members are chosen by party lists in both countries , by-elections where voters elect their preferred candidate are only used to fill a vacancy in a constituency seat if a vacancy arises from the death or resignation of a party list member , the next unelected candidate on the party list is offered the seat for example , on the resignation of darren hughes in march 2011 , louisa wall was elected after all the five candidates above her on the new zealand labour party 's list declined the seat in the german bundestag , which uses mixed-member proportional representation , by-elections were originally held upon the vacancy of any constituency seat , in the same manner as scotland and new zealand this was changed in january 1953 , since which time vacancies in constituency seats have been filled by the next candidate on the state list of the party which won the seat , in the same manner as vacancies among list seats by-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it â€“ typically , if the former member was elected as an independent in parliamentary systems , party discipline is often so strong that the governing party can only lose a vote of no confidence after losing enough by-elections for it to become a minority government one reason for this is that voter turnout at by-elections tends to be lower and skewed toward highly motivated supporters of the opposition party it also gave important momentum to the new party the media called it a '' mini-election '' , a test of the liberal government 's popularity with a general election due in less than a year wentworth was considered an exceptionally safe seat for the liberal party , as it had only ever been held by the liberal party and its predecessor parties since its creation in 1901 in 1965 the british foreign secretary patrick gordon walker stood in the leyton by-election for election to the uk parliament , having been defeated in controversial circumstances in smethwick at the previous year 's general election

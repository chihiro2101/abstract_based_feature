cromwell devised a new election that would be called by the king at a time of the king 's choosing 36 during the parliaments of charles ii , which reached up to 18 years in length , by-elections were the primary means by which new members entered the house of commons in the united states , these contests have been called '' special elections '' because they do not always occur on election day like regular congressional elections special elections are held when a seat in the house of representatives , state legislature , or local legislature becomes vacant constitution requires that vacancies in the house of representatives be filled with a special election ( unlike the senate , where it is up to law of the state involved to determine how the vacancy is filled ) in most cases where a vacancy is filled through a special election , a primary will also be held to determine which candidates will represent the major parties when one seat in a proportional representation constituency becomes vacant , the consequences vary for example , a by-election may be held to fill just the vacancy or all the seats in the constituency could be contested in the by-election this usually occurs if a vacancy arises shortly before a planned general election ( within six months in new zealand ) nominating another candidate with the same affiliation as the former member & nbsp ; – typically , in list systems , the next candidate on the party list if a vacancy arises from the death or resignation of a party list member , the next unelected candidate on the party list is offered the seat for example , on the resignation of darren hughes in march 2011 , louisa wall was elected after all the five candidates above her on the new zealand labour party 's list declined the seat in the german bundestag , which uses mixed-member proportional representation , by-elections were originally held upon the vacancy of any constituency seat , in the same manner as scotland and new zealand by-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it – typically , if the former member was elected as an independent in parliamentary systems , party discipline is often so strong that the governing party can only lose a vote of no confidence after losing enough by-elections for it to become a minority government in the united states senate , scott brown 's election in 2010 ended the filibuster-proof supermajority formerly enjoyed by democrats a 2016 study of special elections to the united states house of representatives found '' that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes , presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well '' seats which have unexpectedly changed hands in by-elections often revert to the former party in the next general election in 1965 the british foreign secretary patrick gordon walker stood in the leyton by-election for election to the uk parliament , having been defeated in controversial circumstances in smethwick at the previous year 's general election

the procedure for filling a vacant seat in the house of commons of england was developed during the reformation parliament of the 16th century by thomas cromwell ; previously a seat had remained empty upon the death of a member cromwell devised a new election that would be called by the king at a time of the king 's choosing 36 during the parliaments of charles ii , which reached up to 18 years in length , by-elections were the primary means by which new members entered the house of commons by-elections are held in most nations that elect their parliaments through single-member constituencies , whether with or without a runoff round special elections are held when a seat in the house of representatives , state legislature , or local legislature becomes vacant alternatives to holding a by-election include : choosing from those losing candidates at the previous election who choose to contest the recount to fill the vacancy , as in tasmania or the australian capital territory , keeping the seat vacant until the next general election nominating another candidate with the same affiliation as the former member & nbsp ; – typically , in list systems , the next candidate on the party list scotland and new zealand still hold by-elections , despite having adopted the mixed-member proportional representation system , in which some members are chosen by party lists if a vacancy arises from the death or resignation of a party list member , the next unelected candidate on the party list is offered the seat for example , on the resignation of darren hughes in march 2011 , louisa wall was elected after all the five candidates above her on the new zealand labour party 's list declined the seat this was changed in january 1953 , since which time vacancies in constituency seats have been filled by the next candidate on the state list of the party which won the seat , in the same manner as vacancies among list seats by-elections are now only held if a vacancy arises in a constituency seat and there is no associated party list with which to fill it – typically , if the former member was elected as an independent in parliamentary systems , party discipline is often so strong that the governing party can only lose a vote of no confidence after losing enough by-elections for it to become a minority government by-elections can also be important if a minority party needs to gain one or more seats in order to gain official party status or the balance of power in a minority or coalition situation a 2016 study of special elections to the united states house of representatives found '' that while candidate characteristics affect special election outcomes , presidential approval is predictive of special election outcomes as well '' seats which have unexpectedly changed hands in by-elections often revert to the former party in the next general election in canada , in 1978 , 15 by-elections were held on a single date , restoring the house of commons to 264 members the seat was traditionally a safe seat for the nationalist party against the labor party , but the emergence of the country party lead to a vote splitting the pro-democracy camp was considered safe in de facto first past the post by-election because both pro-democracy camp and pro-beijing camp would only nominate one candidate to fill in the by-election

450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes the triple valve is described as being so named as it performs three functions : charging air into an air tank ready to be used , applying the brakes , and releasing them it 'holds ' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release ) if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder if the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir , the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed , causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder emergency braking rapidly applies the brakes in the event of a brake pipe failure or an emergency application by the engine operator or passenger emergency alarm/cord/handle when the train brakes are applied during normal operation , the engine operator makes a '' service application '' or a '' service rate reduction ‚Äù , which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes an emergency brake application brings in an additional component of each car 's air brake system normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder , while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder , resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application due to the length of trains and the small diameter of the brake pipe , the rate of reduction is highest near the front of the train ( in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application ) or near the break in the brake pipe ( in the case of loss of brake pipe integrity ) the train brakes are released by admitting reduced and regulated main reservoir air pressure to the brake pipe through the engineer 's automatic brake valve the brakes are applied when the engineer moves the automatic brake handle to a '' service '' position , which causes a reduction in brake pipe pressure on the other hand , a slow leak that gradually reduces brake pipe pressure to zero , something that might happen if the air compressor is inoperative and therefore not maintaining main reservoir pressure , will not cause an emergency brake application passenger trains have had for a long time a 3-wire version of the electro-pneumatic brake , which gives up to seven levels of braking force it is routed through various '' governors '' ( switches operated by air pressure ) which monitor critical components such as compressors , brake pipes and air reservoirs therefore , as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe , each car 's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application since the main reservoir pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive , the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the brake pipe , this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe main reservoir pipe pressure can also be used to supply air for auxiliary systems such as pneumatic door operators or air suspension the working principle is the same as for the westinghouse air brake the main competitor to the air brake is the vacuum brake , which operates on negative pressure

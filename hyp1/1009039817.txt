450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes the triple valve is described as being so named as it performs three functions : charging air into an air tank ready to be used , applying the brakes , and releasing them it 'holds ' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake cylinder pressure and the recharging of the reservoir during the release ) in his patent application , westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device ' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it : the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder , the reservoir charging valve , and the brake cylinder release valve if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder this action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved the triple valve also causes the brake cylinder to be exhausted to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder when the train brakes are applied during normal operation , the engine operator makes a '' service application '' or a '' service rate reduction ” , which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate the system which controls the brake pipe is called the automatic brake the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes in addition , each car 's air brake reservoir is divided into two sections—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the '' dual-compartment reservoir ” normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder , while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder , resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application , a blown hose ) , the train breaking-in-two and uncoupling air hoses , or the engineer moving the automatic brake valve to the emergency position , will cause an emergency brake ( train ) on the other hand , a slow leak that gradually reduces brake pipe pressure to zero , something that might happen if the air compressor is inoperative and therefore not maintaining main reservoir pressure , will not cause an emergency brake application electro-pneumatic or ep brakes are a type of air brake that allows for immediate application of brakes throughout the train instead of the sequential application ep brakes have been in british practice since 1949 and also used in german high-speed trains ( most notably the ice ) since the late 1980s ; they are fully described in electro-pneumatic brake system on british railway trains therefore , as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe , each car 's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application these generally involve connecting the air brake hoses , charging up the brake system , setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied , and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released the main competitor to the air brake is the vacuum brake , which operates on negative pressure conversely , the vacuum brake had the advantage of gradual release long before the westinghouse automatic air brake , which was originally only available in the direct-release form still common in freight service

450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes the new westinghouse brakes were explained to the railroad workers in many books thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes the triple valve is described as being so named as it performs three functions : charging air into an air tank ready to be used , applying the brakes , and releasing them if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder if the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir , the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed , causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase the triple valve also causes the brake cylinder to be exhausted to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder the subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs modern air brake systems serve two functions : service braking applies and releases the brakes during normal operations emergency braking rapidly applies the brakes in the event of a brake pipe failure or an emergency application by the engine operator or passenger emergency alarm/cord/handle the gradual reduction in brake pipe pressure will mitigate this effect the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes an emergency application also results when the integrity of the brake pipe is lost , as all air will also be immediately vented to atmosphere an emergency brake application brings in an additional component of each car 's air brake system the triple valve is divided into two portions : the service section , which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions , and the emergency section , which senses the faster emergency reduction of train line pressure normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder , while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder , resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application the train brakes are released by admitting reduced and regulated main reservoir air pressure to the brake pipe through the engineer 's automatic brake valve it is routed through various '' governors '' ( switches operated by air pressure ) which monitor critical components such as compressors , brake pipes and air reservoirs the car reservoirs recharge only when the brake pipe pressure is higher than the reservoir pressure in addition to the traditional brake pipe , this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe , which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive 's main reservoir the main reservoir is where the locomotive 's air compressor output is stored , and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all systems that use it the main competitor to the air brake is the vacuum brake , which operates on negative pressure

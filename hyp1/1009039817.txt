450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes straight air brakes are still used on locomotives , although as a dual circuit system , usually with each bogie ( truck ) having its own circuit in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve see , for example , a textbook on the westinghouse air brake ( scranton : international textbook school , 1900 ) thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes in his patent application , westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device ' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it : the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder , the reservoir charging valve , and the brake cylinder release valve if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder at that point , the airflow from the reservoir to the brake cylinder is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure the triple valve also causes the brake cylinder to be exhausted to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized when the engine operator applies the brake by operating the locomotive brake valve , the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate , reducing the train line pressure and in turn triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder the subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs when the train brakes are applied during normal operation , the engine operator makes a '' service application '' or a '' service rate reduction ” , which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate pressure changes during a service reduction propagate at the local speed of sound , which means the brakes of the rear-most cars will apply sometime after those of the forward-most cars apply the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control an emergency brake application brings in an additional component of each car 's air brake system in addition , each car 's air brake reservoir is divided into two sections—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the '' dual-compartment reservoir ” normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service section to the brake cylinder , while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the sections of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder , resulting in a 20 to 30 percent stronger application during normal service , the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact , the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure , a blown hose ) , the train breaking-in-two and uncoupling air hoses , or the engineer moving the automatic brake valve to the emergency position , will cause an emergency brake ( train ) electro-pneumatic or ep brakes are a type of air brake that allows for immediate application of brakes throughout the train instead of the sequential application the westinghouse air brake system is very reliable , but not infallible therefore , as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe , each car 's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application these generally involve connecting the air brake hoses , charging up the brake system , setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied , and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released the vacuum brake is a little simpler than the air brake , with an ejector with no moving parts on steam engines or a mechanical or electrical '' exhauster '' on a diesel or electric locomotive replacing the air compressor

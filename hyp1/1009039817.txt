450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars the principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence the loss of the force applying the brakes in order to design a system without the shortcomings of the straight air system , westinghouse invented a system wherein each piece of railroad rolling stock was equipped with an pressure tank and a triple valve , also known as a control valve thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes the triple valve is described as being so named as it performs three functions : charging air into an air tank ready to be used , applying the brakes , and releasing them in his patent application , westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device ' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it : the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder , the reservoir charging valve , and the brake cylinder release valve if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder this action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved if the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir , the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed , causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized the subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs when the train brakes are applied during normal operation , the engine operator makes a '' service application '' or a '' service rate reduction ” , which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate the gradual reduction in brake pipe pressure will mitigate this effect the independent brake is a '' straight air '' system that makes brake applications on the head-of-train locomotive consist independently of the automatic brake , providing for more nuanced train control in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes an emergency brake application brings in an additional component of each car 's air brake system in addition , each car 's air brake reservoir is divided into two sections—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the '' dual-compartment reservoir ” due to the length of trains and the small diameter of the brake pipe , the rate of reduction is highest near the front of the train ( in the case of an engine operator-initiated emergency application ) or near the break in the brake pipe ( in the case of loss of brake pipe integrity ) to prevent this , each triple valve 's emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port , which , when activated by an emergency application , also locally vents the brake pipe 's pressure directly to atmosphere the locomotive 's air compressor charges the main reservoir with air at the brakes are applied when the engineer moves the automatic brake handle to a '' service '' position , which causes a reduction in brake pipe pressure on the conventional side , the control valve set a reference pressure in a volume , which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve it is routed through various '' governors '' ( switches operated by air pressure ) which monitor critical components such as compressors , brake pipes and air reservoirs the westinghouse air brake system is very reliable , but not infallible main reservoir pipe pressure can also be used to supply air for auxiliary systems such as pneumatic door operators or air suspension the vacuum brake is a little simpler than the air brake , with an ejector with no moving parts on steam engines or a mechanical or electrical '' exhauster '' on a diesel or electric locomotive replacing the air compressor

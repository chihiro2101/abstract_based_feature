450px in the air brake 's simplest form , called the straight air system , compressed air pushes on a piston in a cylinder the pressurized air comes from an air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars thumb unlike the straight air system , the westinghouse system uses a reduction in air pressure in the train line to indirectly apply the brakes in his patent application , westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device ' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it : the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder , the reservoir charging valve , and the brake cylinder release valve if the pressure in the train line is lower than that of the reservoir , the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car 's reservoir is fed into the brake cylinder if the pressure in the train line is higher than that of the reservoir , the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed , causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase as the pressure in the train line and that of the reservoir equalize , the triple valve closes , causing the air in the reservoir to be sealed in , and the brake cylinder is not pressurized the subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of the brake cylinder to the atmosphere , releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs the westinghouse system is thus fail safe & mdash ; any failure in the train line , including a separation ( '' break-in-two '' ) of the train , will cause a loss of train line pressure , causing the brakes to be applied and bringing the train to a stop , thus preventing a runaway train modern air brake systems serve two functions : service braking applies and releases the brakes during normal operations when the train brakes are applied during normal operation , the engine operator makes a '' service application '' or a '' service rate reduction ” , which means that the brake pipe pressure reduces at a controlled rate the system which controls the brake pipe is called the automatic brake the independent system also provides a bail off mechanism , which releases the brakes on the lead locomotives without affecting the brake application on the rest of the train in the event the train needs to make an emergency stop , the engine operator can make an '' emergency application , '' which will rapidly vent all of the brake pipe pressure to atmosphere , resulting in a faster application of the train 's brakes an emergency application also results when the integrity of the brake pipe is lost , as all air will also be immediately vented to atmosphere the triple valve is divided into two portions : the service section , which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions , and the emergency section , which senses the faster emergency reduction of train line pressure in addition , each car 's air brake reservoir is divided into two sections—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the '' dual-compartment reservoir ” farther away from the source of the emergency application , the rate of reduction can be reduced to the point where triple valves will not detect the application as an emergency reduction to prevent this , each triple valve 's emergency portion contains an auxiliary vent port , which , when activated by an emergency application , also locally vents the brake pipe 's pressure directly to atmosphere the train brakes are released by admitting reduced and regulated main reservoir air pressure to the brake pipe through the engineer 's automatic brake valve the brakes are applied when the engineer moves the automatic brake handle to a '' service '' position , which causes a reduction in brake pipe pressure during normal service , the pressure in the brake pipe is never reduced to zero and in fact , the smallest reduction that will cause a satisfactory brake response is used to conserve brake pipe pressure a sudden pressure reduction caused by a loss of brake pipe integrity ( e.g electro-pneumatic or ep brakes are a type of air brake that allows for immediate application of brakes throughout the train instead of the sequential application in north america , westinghouse air brake supplied high speed control brake equipment for several post-world war ii streamlined passenger trains the triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction therefore , as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe , each car 's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application

however , he often does not know of his role , or , even worse , he struggles against it , never to succeed all the different eternal champions are implied to be different facets or '' incarnations '' of one semi-conscious being ( a platonic archetype of a sort ) : most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient chaos-aligned weapon , the black sword , which in turns takes on a different form for each champion space- and time-travels through the multiverse are in fact possible , to the point that one humanoid species called the eldrens is spread among many different worlds and ages and interacts with many different champions ; however , cosmic laws establish that no two eternal champions can coexist in the same situation , or the very fabric of reality would be severely damaged '' the blood red game '' was eventually combined with the earlier novella '' the sundered worlds '' ( 1962 ) into the full-length novel the sundered worlds ( 1965 ) , making asquiol somehow of a guest character into the von bek saga moorcock planned a whole series about aubec 's wars against melniboné in order to ensure human independence , eventually reconnecting to elric 's saga as a direct prequel , but the project was eventually aborted ;

expanded into a novel of the same title in 1970 ) erekosë has been dead for generations , but a necromantic ritual resurrects him as a new existence for john daker ; the reborn erekosë consequently gets entangled into a world war between humans and eldrens and into a love triangle between the two factions ' princesses , eldren ermizhad and human iolinda prince flamadin : flamadin is the ruler of a dimension called draachenheem and owns both the dragon sword ( a black sword comparable in power to ulrik skarlson 's cold sword ) and the actoris stone , an enchanted gem that would later become elric of melniboné 's family heirloom elric of melniboné : moorcock 's breakthrough character , elric lives in a prehistorical age of earth and is the sorcerer-emperor of the melnibonéans , a pre-human species of chaos-aligned feys ( later retconned into being a branch of the eldren ) ; he wields the soul-eating sword stormbringer , on which he is co-dependent due to its frail health , and spends his life trying to thwart the chaos god arioch , who is also his undesired personal patron due to an ancestral melnibonéan tradition ;

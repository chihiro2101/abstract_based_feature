the authority of the lordship of ireland 's government was seldom extended throughout the island of ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the pale around dublin , and some provincial towns , including cork , limerick , waterford , wexford and their hinterlands henry ii of england invaded ireland to control strongbow , who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes ( there had been earlier fears that saxon refugees might use either ireland or flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066 ) ; much of the later plantagenet consolidation of south wales was in furtherance of holding open routes to ireland religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of europe influenced more directly by the holy see , although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155 henry 's primary motivation for invading ireland in 1171 was to control strongbow and other norman lords in the process he accepted the fealty of the gaels kings at dublin in november 1171 and summoned the synod of cashel in 1172 , this bringing the irish church into conformity with english and european norms in 1175 the treaty of windsor was agreed by henry and ruaidr√≠ ua conchobair , high king of ireland at the oxford parliament in may 1177 , henry replaced william fitzaldelm and granted john his irish lands , so becoming lord of ireland ( dominus hiberniae ) in 1177 when he was 10 years old , with the territory being known in english as the lordship of ireland henry had wanted john to be crowned king of ireland on his first visit in 1185 , but pope lucius iii specifically refused permission , citing the dubious nature of a claim supposedly provided by pope adrian iv years earlier lucius then died while john was in ireland , and henry obtained consent from pope urban iii and ordered a crown of gold and peacock feathers for john . following the deaths of john 's older brothers he became king of england in 1199 , and so the lordship of ireland , instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior norman prince , came under the direct rule of the angevin crown in the legal terminology of john 's successors , the '' lordship of ireland '' referred to the sovereignty vested in the crown of england ; the corresponding territory was referred to as the '' land of ireland '' the end of this rebellion and henry viii 's seizure of the irish monasteries around 1540 led on to his plan to create a new kingdom based on the existing parliament the title was changed by the crown of ireland act passed by the irish parliament in 1542 when , on henry viii 's demand , he was granted a new title , king of ireland , with the state renamed the kingdom of ireland

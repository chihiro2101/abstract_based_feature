the authority of the lordship of ireland 's government was seldom extended throughout the island of ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the pale around dublin , and some provincial towns , including cork , limerick , waterford , wexford and their hinterlands religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of europe influenced more directly by the holy see , although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155 henry 's primary motivation for invading ireland in 1171 was to control strongbow and other norman lords in the process he accepted the fealty of the gaels kings at dublin in november 1171 and summoned the synod of cashel in 1172 , this bringing the irish church into conformity with english and european norms while laudabiliter had referred to the '' kingdom '' of ireland , the papacy was ambiguous about continuing to describe it as a kingdom as early as 1185 at the oxford parliament in may 1177 , henry replaced william fitzaldelm and granted john his irish lands , so becoming lord of ireland ( dominus hiberniae ) in 1177 when he was 10 years old , with the territory being known in english as the lordship of ireland henry had wanted john to be crowned king of ireland on his first visit in 1185 , but pope lucius iii specifically refused permission , citing the dubious nature of a claim supposedly provided by pope adrian iv years earlier lucius then died while john was in ireland , and henry obtained consent from pope urban iii and ordered a crown of gold and peacock feathers for john . following the deaths of john 's older brothers he became king of england in 1199 , and so the lordship of ireland , instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior norman prince , came under the direct rule of the angevin crown in the legal terminology of john 's successors , the '' lordship of ireland '' referred to the sovereignty vested in the crown of england ; the corresponding territory was referred to as the '' land of ireland '' but little of this engagement with mainstream european life was of benefit to those the normans called the '' mere irish '' however , a rebellion by the 9th earl 's heir silken thomas in 1535 led on to a less sympathetic system of rule by mainly english-born administrators english monarchs continued to use the title '' lord of ireland '' to refer to their position of conquered lands on the island of ireland

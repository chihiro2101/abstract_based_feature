the authority of the lordship of ireland 's government was seldom extended throughout the island of ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the pale around dublin , and some provincial towns , including cork , limerick , waterford , wexford and their hinterlands it owed its origins to the decision of a leinster dynast , diarmait mac murchada ( diarmuid macmorrough ) , to bring in a norman knight based in wales , richard de clare , 2nd earl of pembroke ( alias 'strongbow ' ) , to aid him in his battle to regain his throne , after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new irish high king ( the previous incumbent had protected macmurrough ) henry ii of england invaded ireland to control strongbow , who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes ( there had been earlier fears that saxon refugees might use either ireland or flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066 ) ; much of the later plantagenet consolidation of south wales was in furtherance of holding open routes to ireland from 1155 henry claimed that pope adrian iv had given him authorisation to reform the irish church by assuming control of ireland henry 's primary motivation for invading ireland in 1171 was to control strongbow and other norman lords john lackland as lord of ireland having captured a small part of ireland on the east coast , henry used the land to solve a dispute dividing his family at the oxford parliament in may 1177 , henry replaced william fitzaldelm and granted john his irish lands , so becoming lord of ireland ( dominus hiberniae ) in 1177 when he was 10 years old , with the territory being known in english as the lordship of ireland henry had wanted john to be crowned king of ireland on his first visit in 1185 , but pope lucius iii specifically refused permission , citing the dubious nature of a claim supposedly provided by pope adrian iv years earlier . following the deaths of john 's older brothers he became king of england in 1199 , and so the lordship of ireland , instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior norman prince , came under the direct rule of the angevin crown in the legal terminology of john 's successors , the '' lordship of ireland '' referred to the sovereignty vested in the crown of england ; the corresponding territory was referred to as the '' land of ireland '' but the irish chiefs became increasingly alienated by the oppressive measures of the english government and began openly rebelling against the crown the title was changed by the crown of ireland act passed by the irish parliament in 1542 when , on henry viii 's demand , he was granted a new title , king of ireland , with the state renamed the kingdom of ireland

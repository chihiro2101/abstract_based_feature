plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally they had a very low luminance '' dark-room '' black level compared with the lighter grey of the unilluminated parts of an lcd screen ( as plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light , blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on lcd 's the display panel itself is about thick , generally allowing the device 's total thickness ( including electronics ) to be less than the plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 & nbsp ; °c ( 2200 & nbsp ; °f ) plasmatelevisions.org – how to calibrate your plasma tv the lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours ( 11 years ) of actual display time , or 27 years at 10 hours per day plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources plasma display panels can not be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than plasma display advantages and disadvantages hometheatermag.com – plasma vs lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts some lcd panel types , like ips , require a polishing process that can introduce a haze usually referred to as '' clouding '' earlier generation displays were more susceptible to screen burn-in and image retention due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method , some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues , intensities and dither patterns earlier generation displays ( circa 2006 and prior ) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time , resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness uses more electrical power , on average , than an lcd tv using a led backlight older ccfl backlights for lcd panels used quite a bit more power , and older plasma tvs used quite a bit more power than recent models fixed-pixel displays such as plasma tvs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel the most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853×480 ( edtv ) , 1,366×768 or 1920×1080 ( hdtv ) as a result , picture quality varies depending on the performance of the video scaler and the upscaling and downscaling algorithms used by each display manufacturer plasmatvbuyingguide.com – step 3 : is a 1080p resolution plasma tv worth the extra money ? afterdawn.com – native resolution plasmatvbuyingguide.com – edtv plasma vs these displays are usually progressive displays , with non-square pixels , and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard-definition signals to match their native display resolution thumb a panel of a plasma display typically comprises millions of tiny compartments in between two panels of glass just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk , when a high voltage is applied across the cell , the gas in the cells forms a plasma the uv photons then strike phosphor that is painted on the inside of the cell each pixel in a plasma display is made up of three cells comprising the primary colors of visible light a magnesium oxide layer may be present to protect the dielectric layer and to emit secondary electrons in a monochrome plasma panel , the gas is mostly neon , and the color is the characteristic orange of a neon lamp ( or sign ) once a glow discharge has been initiated in a cell , it can be maintained by applying a low-level voltage between all the horizontal and vertical electrodes–even after the ionizing voltage is removed in contrast , a full-on-full-off test measures the ratio using a pure black screen and a pure white screen , which gives higher values but does not represent a typical viewing scenario plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage a long period of sales decline occurred in the late 1970s because semiconductor memory made crt displays cheaper than the 2500 usd plato plasma displays , '' getting a charge out of plasma tv '' , cnet news , june 18 , 2007 , retrieved 2008-11-24 in 1995 , fujitsu introduced the first plasma display panel ; weber , l until the early 2000s , plasma displays were the most popular choice for hdtv flat panel display as they had many benefits over lcds screen sizes have increased since the introduction of plasma displays plasma display panels : the colorful history of an illinois technology ' ' by jamie hutchinson , electrical and computer engineering alumni news , winter 2002–2003 ( via archive.org ) nytimes.com – forget l.c.d

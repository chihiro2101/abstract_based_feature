plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally ( as plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light , blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on lcd 's ) hdguru.com – choosing the hdtv that ’ s right for you led-backlit lcd televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction plasmatelevisions.org – how to calibrate your plasma tv the lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours ( 11 years ) of actual display time , or 27 years at 10 hours per day plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources plasma display panels can not be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions ( edtv ) this small , even fewer have made 32 inch plasma hdtvs lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts lcds using ips technology have the widest angles , but they do not equal the range of plasma primarily due to '' ips glow '' , a generally whitish haze that appears due to the nature of the ips pixel design lcd panel backlights nearly always produce uneven brightness levels , although this is not always noticeable some lcd panel types , like ips , require a polishing process that can introduce a haze usually referred to as '' clouding '' in their heyday , they were less expensive for the buyer per square inch than lcd , particularly when considering equivalent performance recent models have a pixel orbiter that moves the entire picture slower than is noticeable to the human eye , which reduces the effect of burn-in but does not prevent it due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method , some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues , intensities and dither patterns earlier generation displays ( circa 2006 and prior ) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time , resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness older ccfl backlights for lcd panels used quite a bit more power , and older plasma tvs used quite a bit more power than recent models plasmatvbuyingguide.com - plasma tvs at altitude , 2012 for those who wish to listen to am radio , or are amateur radio operators ( hams ) or shortwave listeners ( swl ) , the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) from these devices can be irritating or disabling fixed-pixel displays such as plasma tvs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel the most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853×480 ( edtv ) , 1,366×768 or 1920×1080 ( hdtv ) plasmatvbuyingguide.com – step 3 : is a 1080p resolution plasma tv worth the extra money ? afterdawn.com – native resolution early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition ( ed ) with a native resolution of 840×480 ( discontinued ) or 853×480 , and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolution plasmatvbuyingguide.com – edtv plasma vs early high-definition ( hd ) plasma displays had a resolution of 1024x1024 and were alternate lighting of surfaces ( alis ) panels made by fujitsu/hitachi cnet uk – alis ( alternate lighting of surfaces ) google books – newnes guide to television and video technology by k these displays are usually progressive displays , with non-square pixels , and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard-definition signals to match their native display resolution 1024×768 resolution requires that 720p content be downscaled in one direction and upscaled in the other about.com – are all plasma televisions hdtvs ? practical home theater guide – plasma tv faqs these compartments , or '' bulbs '' or '' cells '' , hold a mixture of noble gases and a minuscule amount of another gas ( e.g just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk , when a high voltage is applied across the cell , the gas in the cells forms a plasma the '' address electrodes '' sit behind the cells , along the rear glass plate , and can be opaque in a monochrome plasma panel , the gas is mostly neon , and the color is the characteristic orange of a neon lamp ( or sign ) once a glow discharge has been initiated in a cell , it can be maintained by applying a low-level voltage between all the horizontal and vertical electrodes–even after the ionizing voltage is removed this type of panel has inherent memory plasma displays use the same phosphors as crts , which accounts for the extremely accurate color reproduction when viewing television or computer video images ( which use an rgb color system designed for crt displays ) plasma displays had a better contrast ratio , viewability angle , and less motion blur than the lcds that were available at the time , and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color lcd displays in 1992 doi:10.1889/1.1832431 in late 2006 , analysts noted that lcds had overtaken plasmas , particularly in the 40-inch ( 100 & nbsp ; cm ) and above segment where plasma had previously gained market share the increased size , lower weight , falling prices , and often lower electrical power consumption of lcds made them competitive with plasma television sets lcd tv market ten times larger than plasma tvs on units-shipped basis , 20 february 2011 , jonathan sutton , hdtvtest.co.uk , retrieved at september 12 , 2011 since that time , shipments of plasma tvs have declined substantially

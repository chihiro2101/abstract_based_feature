plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally ( as plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light , blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on lcd 's ) hdguru.com – choosing the hdtv that ’ s right for you led-backlit lcd televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction the display panel itself is about thick , generally allowing the device 's total thickness ( including electronics ) to be less than power consumption varies greatly with picture content , with bright scenes drawing significantly more power than darker ones – this is also true for crts as well as modern lcds where led backlight brightness is adjusted dynamically the plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 & nbsp ; °c ( 2200 & nbsp ; °f ) plasmatelevisions.org – how to calibrate your plasma tv the lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours ( 11 years ) of actual display time , or 27 years at 10 hours per day plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources plasma display panels can not be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions ( edtv ) this small , even fewer have made 32 inch plasma hdtvs with the trend toward large-screen television technology , the 32 inch screen size is rapidly disappearing lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts lcd panel backlights nearly always produce uneven brightness levels , although this is not always noticeable some lcd panel types , like ips , require a polishing process that can introduce a haze usually referred to as '' clouding '' due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method , some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues , intensities and dither patterns earlier generation displays ( circa 2006 and prior ) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time , resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness lcd , 2013 does not work as well at high altitudes above 6,500 feet ( 2,000 meters ) due to pressure differential between the gases inside the screen and the air pressure at altitude plasma displays are generally heavier than lcd and may require more careful handling , such as being kept upright the most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853×480 ( edtv ) , 1,366×768 or 1920×1080 ( hdtv ) plasmatvbuyingguide.com – step 3 : is a 1080p resolution plasma tv worth the extra money ? afterdawn.com – native resolution early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition ( ed ) with a native resolution of 840×480 ( discontinued ) or 853×480 , and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolution plasmatvbuyingguide.com – edtv plasma vs early high-definition ( hd ) plasma displays had a resolution of 1024x1024 and were alternate lighting of surfaces ( alis ) panels made by fujitsu/hitachi these displays are usually progressive displays , with non-square pixels , and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard-definition signals to match their native display resolution just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk , when a high voltage is applied across the cell , the gas in the cells forms a plasma with flow of electricity ( electrons ) , some of the electrons strike mercury particles as the electrons move through the plasma , momentarily increasing the energy level of the atom until the excess energy is shed mercury sheds the energy as ultraviolet ( uv ) photons the collisions of the flowing electrons in the plasma with the inert gas atoms leads to light emission ; such light-emitting plasmas are known as glow discharges in a monochrome plasma panel , the gas is mostly neon , and the color is the characteristic orange of a neon lamp ( or sign ) in color panels , the back of each cell is coated with a phosphor the ultraviolet photons emitted by the plasma excite these phosphors , which give off visible light with colors determined by the phosphor materials plasma displays are different from liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) , another lightweight flat-screen display using very different technology contrast ratios for plasma displays are often advertised as high as 5,000,000:1 plasma screens use significantly more energy than crt and lcd screens the panaplex display , generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display , uses the same technology as later plasma video displays , but began life as a seven-segment display for use in adding machines another industry trend was the consolidation of plasma display manufacturers , with around 50 brands available but only five manufacturers screen sizes have increased since the introduction of plasma displays this decline has been attributed to the competition from liquid crystal ( lcd ) televisions , whose prices have fallen more rapidly than those of the plasma tvs

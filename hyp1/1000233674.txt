plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally they had a very low luminance '' dark-room '' black level compared with the lighter grey of the unilluminated parts of an lcd screen ( as plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light , blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on lcd 's ) hdguru.com – choosing the hdtv that ’ s right for you led-backlit lcd televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction the display panel itself is about thick , generally allowing the device 's total thickness ( including electronics ) to be less than the plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 & nbsp ; °c ( 2200 & nbsp ; °f ) plasmatelevisions.org – how to calibrate your plasma tv the lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours ( 11 years ) of actual display time , or 27 years at 10 hours per day plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources plasma display panels can not be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions ( edtv ) this small , even fewer have made 32 inch plasma hdtvs plasma display advantages and disadvantages capable of producing deeper blacks than lcd allowing for a superior contrast ratio lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts wider viewing angles than those of lcd ; images do not suffer from degradation at less than straight ahead angles like lcds lcd panel backlights nearly always produce uneven brightness levels , although this is not always noticeable some lcd panel types , like ips , require a polishing process that can introduce a haze usually referred to as '' clouding '' in their heyday , they were less expensive for the buyer per square inch than lcd , particularly when considering equivalent performance recent models have a pixel orbiter that moves the entire picture slower than is noticeable to the human eye , which reduces the effect of burn-in but does not prevent it earlier generation displays ( circa 2006 and prior ) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time , resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness uses more electrical power , on average , than an lcd tv using a led backlight native plasma television resolutions fixed-pixel displays such as plasma tvs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel the most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853×480 ( edtv ) , 1,366×768 or 1920×1080 ( hdtv ) early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition ( ed ) with a native resolution of 840×480 ( discontinued ) or 853×480 , and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolution plasmatvbuyingguide.com – edtv plasma vs early high-definition ( hd ) plasma displays had a resolution of 1024x1024 and were alternate lighting of surfaces ( alis ) panels made by fujitsu/hitachi these displays are usually progressive displays , with non-square pixels , and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard-definition signals to match their native display resolution about.com – are all plasma televisions hdtvs ? practical home theater guide – plasma tv faqs thumb a panel of a plasma display typically comprises millions of tiny compartments in between two panels of glass these compartments , or '' bulbs '' or '' cells '' , hold a mixture of noble gases and a minuscule amount of another gas ( e.g just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk , when a high voltage is applied across the cell , the gas in the cells forms a plasma varying the voltage of the signals to the cells thus allows different perceived colors the transparent display electrodes are mounted in front of the cell , along the front glass plate plasma displays are different from liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) , another lightweight flat-screen display using very different technology however , unlike burn-in , this charge build-up is transient and self-corrects after the image condition that caused the effect has been removed and a long enough period has passed ( with the display either off or on ) plasma displays had a better contrast ratio , viewability angle , and less motion blur than the lcds that were available at the time , and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color lcd displays in 1992 high strain point glass is normally necessary because plasma displays have to be baked during manufacture to dry the rare-earth phosphors after they are applied to the display until the early 2000s , plasma displays were the most popular choice for hdtv flat panel display as they had many benefits over lcds

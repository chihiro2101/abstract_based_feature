plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally they had a very low luminance '' dark-room '' black level compared with the lighter grey of the unilluminated parts of an lcd screen ( as plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light , blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on lcd 's the plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 & nbsp ; °c ( 2200 & nbsp ; °f ) plasmatelevisions.org – how to calibrate your plasma tv the lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours ( 11 years ) of actual display time , or 27 years at 10 hours per day plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources plasma display panels can not be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than though considered bulky and thick compared with their lcd counterparts , some sets such as panasonic 's z1 and samsung 's b860 series are as slim as thick making them comparable to lcds in this respect capable of producing deeper blacks than lcd allowing for a superior contrast ratio lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts wider viewing angles than those of lcd ; images do not suffer from degradation at less than straight ahead angles like lcds lcds using ips technology have the widest angles , but they do not equal the range of plasma primarily due to '' ips glow '' , a generally whitish haze that appears due to the nature of the ips pixel design earlier generation displays were more susceptible to screen burn-in and image retention recent models have a pixel orbiter that moves the entire picture slower than is noticeable to the human eye , which reduces the effect of burn-in but does not prevent it due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method , some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues , intensities and dither patterns plasmatvbuyingguide.com - plasma tvs at altitude , 2012 for those who wish to listen to am radio , or are amateur radio operators ( hams ) or shortwave listeners ( swl ) , the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) from these devices can be irritating or disabling plasma displays are generally heavier than lcd and may require more careful handling , such as being kept upright fixed-pixel displays such as plasma tvs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel the most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853×480 ( edtv ) , 1,366×768 or 1920×1080 ( hdtv ) as a result , picture quality varies depending on the performance of the video scaler and the upscaling and downscaling algorithms used by each display manufacturer plasmatvbuyingguide.com – step 3 : is a 1080p resolution plasma tv worth the extra money ? afterdawn.com – native resolution early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition ( ed ) with a native resolution of 840×480 ( discontinued ) or 853×480 , and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolution early high-definition ( hd ) plasma displays had a resolution of 1024x1024 and were alternate lighting of surfaces ( alis ) panels made by fujitsu/hitachi with flow of electricity ( electrons ) , some of the electrons strike mercury particles as the electrons move through the plasma , momentarily increasing the energy level of the atom until the excess energy is shed depending on the phosphors used , different colors of visible light can be achieved each pixel in a plasma display is made up of three cells comprising the primary colors of visible light control circuitry charges the electrodes that cross paths at a cell , creating a voltage difference between front and back some of the atoms in the gas of a cell then lose electrons and become ionized , which creates an electrically conducting plasma of atoms , free electrons , and ions plasma displays use the same phosphors as crts , which accounts for the extremely accurate color reproduction when viewing television or computer video images ( which use an rgb color system designed for crt displays ) plasma displays are different from liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) , another lightweight flat-screen display using very different technology lcd : which is right for you ? afterdawn.com – plasma display gizmodo – giz explains : plasma tv basics to produce light , the cells need to be driven at a relatively high voltage ( ~300 volts ) and the pressure of the gases inside the cell needs to be low ( ~500 torr ) generally , the higher the contrast ratio , the more realistic the image is ( though the '' realism '' of an image depends on many factors including color accuracy , luminance linearity , and spatial linearity ) the panaplex display , generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display , uses the same technology as later plasma video displays , but began life as a seven-segment display for use in adding machines panasonic corporation began a joint development project with plasmaco , which led in 1996 to the purchase of plasmaco , its color ac technology , and its american factory for us 26 million in the year 2000 , the first 60-inch plasma display was developed by plasmaco doi:10.1889/1.1832431 in late 2006 , analysts noted that lcds had overtaken plasmas , particularly in the 40-inch ( 100 & nbsp ; cm ) and above segment where plasma had previously gained market share lcd tv market ten times larger than plasma tvs on units-shipped basis , 20 february 2011 , jonathan sutton , hdtvtest.co.uk , retrieved at september 12 , 2011 since that time , shipments of plasma tvs have declined substantially plasma display panels : the colorful history of an illinois technology ' ' by jamie hutchinson , electrical and computer engineering alumni news , winter 2002–2003 ( via archive.org ) nytimes.com – forget l.c.d

plasma displays are bright ( 1,000 & nbsp ; lux or higher for the display module ) , have a wide color gamut , and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally ( as plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light , blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on lcd 's ) hdguru.com – choosing the hdtv that ’ s right for you led-backlit lcd televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction the display panel itself is about thick , generally allowing the device 's total thickness ( including electronics ) to be less than the plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least 1200 & nbsp ; °c ( 2200 & nbsp ; °f ) plasmatelevisions.org – how to calibrate your plasma tv the lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours ( 11 years ) of actual display time , or 27 years at 10 hours per day plasmatvbuyingguide.com – how long do plasma tvs last ? meow plasma screens are made out of glass , which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources plasma display panels can not be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions ( edtv ) this small , even fewer have made 32 inch plasma hdtvs competing display technologies include cathode ray tube ( crt ) , organic light-emitting diode ( oled ) , crt projectors , amlcd , digital light processing dlp , sed-tv , led display , field emission display ( fed ) , and quantum dot display ( qled ) lcd as they use the same or similar phosphors as are used in crt displays , plasma 's color reproduction is very similar to that of crts wider viewing angles than those of lcd ; images do not suffer from degradation at less than straight ahead angles like lcds lcds using ips technology have the widest angles , but they do not equal the range of plasma primarily due to '' ips glow '' , a generally whitish haze that appears due to the nature of the ips pixel design lcd panel backlights nearly always produce uneven brightness levels , although this is not always noticeable in their heyday , they were less expensive for the buyer per square inch than lcd , particularly when considering equivalent performance due to the bistable nature of the color and intensity generating method , some people will notice that plasma displays have a shimmering or flickering effect with a number of hues , intensities and dither patterns earlier generation displays ( circa 2006 and prior ) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time , resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness plasmatvbuyingguide.com - plasma tvs at altitude , 2012 for those who wish to listen to am radio , or are amateur radio operators ( hams ) or shortwave listeners ( swl ) , the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) from these devices can be irritating or disabling plasma displays are generally heavier than lcd and may require more careful handling , such as being kept upright fixed-pixel displays such as plasma tvs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel the most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 853×480 ( edtv ) , 1,366×768 or 1920×1080 ( hdtv ) as a result , picture quality varies depending on the performance of the video scaler and the upscaling and downscaling algorithms used by each display manufacturer plasmatvbuyingguide.com – step 3 : is a 1080p resolution plasma tv worth the extra money ? afterdawn.com – native resolution these displays are usually progressive displays , with non-square pixels , and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard-definition signals to match their native display resolution about.com – are all plasma televisions hdtvs ? practical home theater guide – plasma tv faqs thumb a panel of a plasma display typically comprises millions of tiny compartments in between two panels of glass with flow of electricity ( electrons ) , some of the electrons strike mercury particles as the electrons move through the plasma , momentarily increasing the energy level of the atom until the excess energy is shed one subpixel has a red light phosphor , one subpixel has a green light phosphor and one subpixel has a blue light phosphor plasma displays use the same phosphors as crts , which accounts for the extremely accurate color reproduction when viewing television or computer video images ( which use an rgb color system designed for crt displays ) contrast ratios for plasma displays are often advertised as high as 5,000,000:1 on the surface , this is a significant advantage of plasma over most other current display technologies , a notable exception being organic light-emitting diode although there are no industry-wide guidelines for reporting contrast ratio , most manufacturers follow either the ansi standard or perform a full-on-full-off test manufacturers can further artificially improve the reported contrast ratio by increasing the contrast and brightness settings to achieve the highest test values plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage plasma displays had a better contrast ratio , viewability angle , and less motion blur than the lcds that were available at the time , and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color lcd displays in 1992 high strain point glass is normally necessary because plasma displays have to be baked during manufacture to dry the rare-earth phosphors after they are applied to the display lcd tv market ten times larger than plasma tvs on units-shipped basis , 20 february 2011 , jonathan sutton , hdtvtest.co.uk , retrieved at september 12 , 2011 since that time , shipments of plasma tvs have declined substantially ; go for plasma , says maker of both according to panasonic corporation home theater geeks – 13 : plasma geek out ( audio podcast )

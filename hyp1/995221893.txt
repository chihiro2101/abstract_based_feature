atmel corporation was founded in 1984 , by george perlegos atmel was an acronym for “ advanced technology for memory and logic ” fundinguniverse.com , '' atmel corporation history '' the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors about.com , '' atmel corporation '' rather than fight the patent claim , atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property atmel used us 60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs in 1991 , atmel expanded the colorado facility after acquiring concurrent logic , a field-programmable gate array ( fpga ) manufacturer the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel 8051 atmel built a new fab alongside the existing es2 fab atmel formed a design team in trondheim , norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers these 8-bit harvard architecture chips were first developed in 1996 under laub atmel divested more manufacturing plants and business lines atmel completed the sale of their secure microcontroller solutions smart card business to inside secure atmel 's dataflash serial interface flash memory products were sold to adesto technologies in october 2012 as atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines , laub also oversaw acquisitions '' atmel 's xsense technology will make curved touchscreens possible ( hands-on ) '' atmel moved into internet of things technology ozmo devices , which developed products for wi-fi direct , was acquired by atmel in december 2012 in 2012 , atmel had approximately us 1.4 billion in annual revenue , with over 60 % of their revenue from microcontrollers , and net income of us 30 million however , in 2016 , microchip agreed to buy atmel for 3.6 billion these include the avr 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers , arm architecture microprocessors , and arm-based flash microcontrollers atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons , sliders , and wheels used on industrial and consumer products products include fpgas , products with military and aerospace applications , and application-specific standard products ( assp ) for space applications , power management , and secure cryptographic memory products atmel also has chips specialized for the smart energy and smart metering markets

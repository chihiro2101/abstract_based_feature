atmel corporation was founded in 1984 , by george perlegos atmel was an acronym for “ advanced technology for memory and logic ” using only us 30,000 in capital , atmel was initially operated as a fabless company , using sanyo and general instrument to make the chip wafers fundinguniverse.com , '' atmel corporation history '' the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors about.com , '' atmel corporation '' rather than fight the patent claim , atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property in addition , atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on atmel used us 60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs atmel then invested another us 30 million in manufacturing technology the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel 8051 atmel.com , '' atmel ’ s self-programming flash microcontrollers '' , whitepaper in 1994 , atmel purchased the eerom assets of seeq technology ( lsi corporation acquired the rest of seeq in 1999 ) in 1995 , atmel acquired the pan-european chipmaker european silicon structures ( es2 ) and thus gained a fabrication facility in rousset , france this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmel 's expertise in flash memory in 2008 , atmel sold their fab in germany to tejas semiconductor atmel 's dataflash serial interface flash memory products were sold to adesto technologies in october 2012 one strategy was to participate in the touch screen market , both in the semiconductor chips and the sensors themselves '' atmel 's xsense technology will make curved touchscreens possible ( hands-on ) '' atmel moved into internet of things technology ozmo devices , which developed products for wi-fi direct , was acquired by atmel in december 2012 in 2012 , atmel had approximately us 1.4 billion in annual revenue , with over 60 % of their revenue from microcontrollers , and net income of us 30 million atmel finally merged with microchip technology in july 2016 after prolonged negotiations for us 3.56 billion atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons , sliders , and wheels used on industrial and consumer products products include fpgas , products with military and aerospace applications , and application-specific standard products ( assp ) for space applications , power management , and secure cryptographic memory products

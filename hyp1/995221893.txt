atmel corporation was founded in 1984 , by george perlegos fundinguniverse.com , '' atmel corporation history '' the first atmel memory products used less power than competitors in 1987 , intel sued atmel for patent infringement about.com , '' atmel corporation '' rather than fight the patent claim , atmel redesigned its products to use different intellectual property in addition , atmel then entered the flash memory business that intel had focused on atmel used us 60 million in venture capital for the 1989 purchase of a fabrication facility from honeywell in colorado springs in 1991 , atmel expanded the colorado facility after acquiring concurrent logic , a field-programmable gate array ( fpga ) manufacturer the first atmel flash memory microcontroller was based on the intel 8051 atmel.com , '' atmel â€™ s self-programming flash microcontrollers '' , whitepaper in 1995 , atmel acquired the pan-european chipmaker european silicon structures ( es2 ) and thus gained a fabrication facility in rousset , france atmel built a new fab alongside the existing es2 fab atmel formed a design team in trondheim , norway to develop the atmel avr line of risc microcontrollers this team combined technology of former students at the norwegian university of science and technology with atmel 's expertise in flash memory this started in 2005 when atmel sold the mhs fab in nantes france to xbybus as atmel divested several fabs and ancillary business lines , laub also oversaw acquisitions '' atmel 's xsense technology will make curved touchscreens possible ( hands-on ) '' atmel moved into internet of things technology ozmo devices , which developed products for wi-fi direct , was acquired by atmel in december 2012 ozmo was founded in 2004 as h-stream wireless by kateljin vleugels and roel peeters , and was based in palo alto , california atmel finally merged with microchip technology in july 2016 after prolonged negotiations for us 3.56 billion these include the avr 8- and 32-bit microcontrollers , arm architecture microprocessors , and arm-based flash microcontrollers atmel also makes simple touch controller chips for buttons , sliders , and wheels used on industrial and consumer products products include fpgas , products with military and aerospace applications , and application-specific standard products ( assp ) for space applications , power management , and secure cryptographic memory products

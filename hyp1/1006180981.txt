the source of the havel is located in the mecklenburg lake district , between lake müritz and the city of neubrandenburg from there the river initially flows southward , eventually joining the elbe , which in turn flows into the north sea in its upper course and between berlin and brandenburg an der havel the river forms several lakes the havel 's main tributary is the spree , which joins the havel in spandau , a western borough of berlin , and is longer and delivers more water than the havel itself above the confluence at the southern end of the ruppiner see , weirs can distribute the waters of the rhin either east- or westwards , rejoining the havel in two places apart along a straight line , and more than apart along the course of the river as the course of the elbe has a higher gradient than the havel , the water level of the havel in havelberg can be kept 1.4 meters below the elbe ( at the junction of the traverse communicating canal , protected by a lock ) the havel is navigable from the mecklenburg lake district to its confluence with the elbe whilst its upper reaches carry little other than leisure traffic , further downstream it provides an important link in the german commercial waterway network , carrying traffic from the rhine and the north sea to berlin and poland the stretch of the river between this lock and the junction with the oder–havel canal is administered as part of the obere–havel–wasserstraße , along with various connecting canals and waterways the stretch of the river between the junction with the oder–havel canal near liebenwalde and the confluence with the spree at spandau is administered as part of the havel–oder–wasserstraße , which also includes the oder-havel canal during the partition of germany , this formed the border between east germany and west berlin , and border control points were established for vessels navigating the river the stretch of the river between the confluence with the spree at spandau and the junction with the elbe–havel canal at plaue is administered as part of the lower havel–waterway , which also includes the stretch of river downstream to the confluence with the elbe like the preceding stretch of the river , the stretch from plaue to the confluence with the elbe at havelberg is administered as part of the lower havel–waterway

the source of the havel is located in the mecklenburg lake district , between lake müritz and the city of neubrandenburg in its upper course and between berlin and brandenburg an der havel the river forms several lakes the havel 's main tributary is the spree , which joins the havel in spandau , a western borough of berlin , and is longer and delivers more water than the havel itself above the confluence a few kilometres of the river before its confluence with the elbe near havelberg are in the state of saxony-anhalt as the course of the elbe has a higher gradient than the havel , the water level of the havel in havelberg can be kept 1.4 meters below the elbe ( at the junction of the traverse communicating canal , protected by a lock ) the havel is navigable from the mecklenburg lake district to its confluence with the elbe whilst its upper reaches carry little other than leisure traffic , further downstream it provides an important link in the german commercial waterway network , carrying traffic from the rhine and the north sea to berlin and poland the stretch of the river between the junction with the oder–havel canal near liebenwalde and the confluence with the spree at spandau is administered as part of the havel–oder–wasserstraße , which also includes the oder-havel canal this canal connects to paretz , on the havel downstream , and was built in the 1950s to allow east german vessels to avoid the stretch of the river under the political control of west berlin the stretch of the river between the confluence with the spree at spandau and the junction with the elbe–havel canal at plaue is administered as part of the lower havel–waterway , which also includes the stretch of river downstream to the confluence with the elbe between spandau and plaue , the river forms part of the main inland waterway route from the rhine and the west of germany , and from hamburg and the north sea ports , to both berlin and poland just downstream of paretz , the river is crossed by the ketzin cable ferry whilst the lower reaches of the havel provide the most direct route to hamburg and the north sea ports , variable water levels in the elbe affect those in the lower havel , and together these can restrict navigation

bohemond was the son of robert guiscard , count of apulia and calabria , and his first wife , alberada of buonalbergo robert 's nephew , abelard of hauteville , was the only baron to protest , because he regarded himself robert 's lawful heir his father dispatched him at the head of an advance guard against the byzantine empire in early 1081 and he captured valona ( now vlorë in albania ) he charged bohemond with the command of his army in the balkans bohemond defeated the byzantines at ioannina and at arta , taking control of most of macedonia and thessaly ; however , the six-month siege of larissa was unsuccessful supply and pay problems ( and the gifts promised to deserters by the byzantines ) undermined the morale of the norman army , so bohemond returned to italy for financial support an epidemic decimated the normans and bohemond , who was taken seriously ill , was forced to return to italy in december 1084 bohemond and roger borsa met at their father 's tomb at venosa to reach a compromise under the terms of their agreement , bohemond received taranto , oria , otranto , brindisi and gallipoli , but acknowledged roger borsa 's succession the ensuing civil war prevented the normans from supporting pope urban ii , and enabled the brothers ' uncle , roger i of sicily , to increase his power in 1097 , bohemond and his uncle roger i of sicily were attacking amalfi , which had revolted against duke roger , when bands of crusaders began to pass on their way through italy to constantinople it is equally likely that he saw in the first crusade the chance to gain a lordship in the middle east lilie details that bohemond 's '' father 's second marriage deprived him of future prospects , '' in norman italy geoffrey malaterra bluntly states that bohemond took the cross with the intention of plundering and conquering greek lands another reason to suspect bohemond 's religious zeal is the supposed embassy bohemond sent to godfrey of bouillon , a powerful crusade leader , asking him to join forces to sack constantinople while godfrey declined his offer , taking constantinople was never far from bohemond 's mind , as seen in his later attempt to take over the byzantine empire he gathered a norman army , which would have been one of the smaller crusade forces with 500 knights and about 2,500-3,500 infantry soldiers , alongside his nephew tancred 's force of 2,000 men bohemond crossed the adriatic sea to constantinople along the route he had tried to follow in 1082–1084 when attacking the byzantine empire he was careful to observe the correct attitude towards alexios along this route , which was mainly keeping his soldiers from plundering byzantine villages en route to constantinople when he arrived at constantinople in april 1097 , he took an oath of homage to emperor alexios , which he demanded from all crusade leaders alexios had no reason to trust bohemond enough to give him a position at the time , but hinted that he could get a position by proving his loyalty bohemond 's best chance at gaining a favorable position was to be loyal to alexios , which he attempted to prove while the crusaders were camped around constantinople bohemond , proficient in greek , was able to be a conduit between alexios and the crusade leaders bohemond also attempted to prove his loyalty by convincing other crusade leaders to take the oath of homage to alexios from constantinople to antioch , bohemond was a stand out among the leaders of the first crusade bohemond 's reputation as an effective strategist and leader came from his fighting experience in the balkans when he took charge of his father 's army against emperor alexios ( 1082–1085 ) bohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of antioch raymond of toulouse decided to give up antioch to bohemond in january 1099 , as the other crusaders moved south to the capture of jerusalem after the fall of jerusalem to the crusaders , bohemond went to jerusalem at christmas 1099 to fulfill his crusade vows the defeat was decisive , making the great eastern principality which bohemond had contemplated impossible instead , bohemond decided to go on the offensive and attack the byzantine empire at its core in constantinople antioch was left in norman hands with bohemond 's nephew tancred the only major biography ( of tancred ) that exists in english is '' tancred : a study of his career and work in their relation to the first crusade and the establishment of the latin states in syria and palestine '' by robert lawrence nicholson

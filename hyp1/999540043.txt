bohemond was the son of robert guiscard , count of apulia and calabria , and his first wife , alberada of buonalbergo with the annulment of his parents ' marriage , bohemond became a bastard bohemond fought in his father 's army during the rebellion of jordan i of capua , geoffrey of conversano and other norman barons in 1079 his father dispatched him at the head of an advance guard against the byzantine empire in early 1081 and he captured valona ( now vlorÃ« in albania ) he charged bohemond with the command of his army in the balkans bohemond accompanied his father to the byzantine empire again in 1084 , when they defeated the venetian fleet and captured corfu she persuaded the army to acclaim roger borsa his father 's successor and they hurried back to southern italy bohemond and roger borsa met at their father 's tomb at venosa to reach a compromise under the terms of their agreement , bohemond received taranto , oria , otranto , brindisi and gallipoli , but acknowledged roger borsa 's succession the ensuing civil war prevented the normans from supporting pope urban ii , and enabled the brothers ' uncle , roger i of sicily , to increase his power bohemond captured bari in 1090 and before long , took control of most lands to the south of melfi in 1097 , bohemond and his uncle roger i of sicily were attacking amalfi , which had revolted against duke roger , when bands of crusaders began to pass on their way through italy to constantinople it is possible that bohemond had religious reasons for joining the first crusade it is equally likely that he saw in the first crusade the chance to gain a lordship in the middle east lilie details that bohemond 's '' father 's second marriage deprived him of future prospects , '' in norman italy while he was well known as a warrior , bohemond 's lordship in italy was small geoffrey malaterra bluntly states that bohemond took the cross with the intention of plundering and conquering greek lands while godfrey declined his offer , taking constantinople was never far from bohemond 's mind , as seen in his later attempt to take over the byzantine empire he gathered a norman army , which would have been one of the smaller crusade forces with 500 knights and about 2,500-3,500 infantry soldiers , alongside his nephew tancred 's force of 2,000 men what contributed to the norman army 's reputation as a great fighting force was their experience fighting in the east others like bohemond had experience fighting the byzantines and muslim groups in the east fifteen years prior with robert guiscard when he arrived at constantinople in april 1097 , he took an oath of homage to emperor alexios , which he demanded from all crusade leaders it 's not clear what exact negotiations bohemond and alexios made concerning bohemond governing part of the eastern byzantine empire alexios hoped the crusaders would reclaim alexios had no reason to trust bohemond enough to give him a position at the time , but hinted that he could get a position by proving his loyalty bohemond 's best chance at gaining a favorable position was to be loyal to alexios , which he attempted to prove while the crusaders were camped around constantinople bohemond saw the opportunity to use the crusade for his own ends at the siege of antioch due to his successful efforts bohemond was seen as the actual leader of the siege of antioch , rather than the elected leader stephen of blois , who would soon leave the siege , claiming illness he then proposed to the other crusade leaders that the leader to take antioch should be put in charge of the city as alexios ' representative tetigus had left in february 1098 bohemond then wanted to take control of antioch for himself , but there were some problems he had to face first by submitting to the patriarch bohemond made connections to jerusalem , who could be an ally against future attacks on antioch , and to keep in the good graces of the pope bohemond saw the root of his problems in alexios and constantinople when it came to preserving the principality of antioch alexios was used to norman battle tactics and their strength , and decided on a war of attrition rather than face them head on antioch was left in norman hands with bohemond 's nephew tancred

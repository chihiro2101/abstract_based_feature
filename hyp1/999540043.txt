bohemond was the son of robert guiscard , count of apulia and calabria , and his first wife , alberada of buonalbergo his parents were related within the degree of kinship that made their marriage invalid under canon law in 1058 , pope nicholas ii strengthened existing canon law against consanguinity and , on that basis , guiscard repudiated alberada in favour of a then more advantageous marriage to sikelgaita , the sister of gisulf , the lombard prince of salerno robert 's nephew , abelard of hauteville , was the only baron to protest , because he regarded himself robert 's lawful heir bohemond fought in his father 's army during the rebellion of jordan i of capua , geoffrey of conversano and other norman barons in 1079 after robert guiscard arrived in the latter half of may , they laid siege to durazzo ( present-day durrÃ«s ) during his absence , most of the norman commanders deserted to the byzantines and a venetian fleet recaptured durazzo and corfu an epidemic decimated the normans and bohemond , who was taken seriously ill , was forced to return to italy in december 1084 she persuaded the army to acclaim roger borsa his father 's successor and they hurried back to southern italy it is possible that bohemond had religious reasons for joining the first crusade it is equally likely that he saw in the first crusade the chance to gain a lordship in the middle east lilie details that bohemond 's '' father 's second marriage deprived him of future prospects , '' in norman italy while godfrey declined his offer , taking constantinople was never far from bohemond 's mind , as seen in his later attempt to take over the byzantine empire he gathered a norman army , which would have been one of the smaller crusade forces with 500 knights and about 2,500-3,500 infantry soldiers , alongside his nephew tancred 's force of 2,000 men others like bohemond had experience fighting the byzantines and muslim groups in the east fifteen years prior with robert guiscard when he arrived at constantinople in april 1097 , he took an oath of homage to emperor alexios , which he demanded from all crusade leaders from constantinople to antioch , bohemond was a stand out among the leaders of the first crusade she met him for the first time when she was fourteen and was seemingly fascinated by him , leaving no similar portrait of any other crusader prince a certain charm hung about this man but was partly marred by a general air of the horrible he was so made in mind and body that both courage and passion reared their crests within him and both inclined to war due to his successful efforts bohemond was seen as the actual leader of the siege of antioch , rather than the elected leader stephen of blois , who would soon leave the siege , claiming illness however , he did not press to end the siege until may 1098 when learning of the approach of kerbogha with a relief army to aid antioch the crusaders ' troubles were not over , however , as kerbogha started his own siege on the newly crusader held antioch bohemond was credited as the general and creator of the battle plan used to defeat kerbogha by raymond of aguilers bohemond then wanted to take control of antioch for himself , but there were some problems he had to face first raymond of toulouse , a prominent crusade leader , did not want to hand antioch over to bohemond when he heard of bohemond 's capture , he offered to redeem the norman commander for 260,000 dinars , if danishmend gazi would hand the prisoner over to byzantium it was followed by a greek attack on cilicia and , despairing of his own resources , bohemond returned to europe for reinforcements in late 1104 bohemond saw the root of his problems in alexios and constantinople when it came to preserving the principality of antioch treadgold , a history of the byzantine state and society , 626 bohemond took a similar route that was successful for his father in illyria and greece while the normans laid siege to dyrrhachium , alexios blockaded the norman camp until bohemond was forced to negotiate antioch was left in norman hands with bohemond 's nephew tancred the crusades series by david donachie ( writing as jack ludlow ) casts bohemund as its main protagonist .

each human character in xanth is born with a unique magical ability , called a talent though many talents are limited in scope ( called the '' spot-on-a-wall '' variety ) , the series focuses mainly on individuals with '' magician '' caliber abilities ( one of the criteria for serving as king of xanth ) as the series progresses , some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents visitors from other dimensions with talents retain their talents after arriving in xanth geographically , modern xanth resembles the state of florida in the united states in shape , but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world although any citizen of xanth can enter mundania at any time through an isthmus in the northwest , mundanes enter the isthmus in xanth from random geographic locations and time periods throughout history in other words , xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world ; and the timeline between xanth and mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards however , mundanes seem to have trouble finding xanth on a consistent basis , making any travel to xanth a somewhat rare occurrence first mentioned in crewel lye , the adult conspiracy is one of the prominent features of the xanth world nearly all subsequent books contain references to the conspiracy and its effects , particularly those novels in which the main characters are children whenever xanth characters visit the nonmagical land outside of xanth , called mundania , its natives ( mundanes ) speak what sounds like gibberish to the xanth characters

each human character in xanth is born with a unique magical ability , called a talent though many talents are limited in scope ( called the '' spot-on-a-wall '' variety ) , the series focuses mainly on individuals with '' magician '' caliber abilities ( one of the criteria for serving as king of xanth ) in addition to the human characters , xanth is populated by elf , centaurs , demons , dragons , fauns , gargoyles , goblins , golems , harpy , merfolk , naga , nymphs , ogres , zombies , curse fiends , and other fictional beasts though initially introduced as obstacles to the human characters , some individuals from those groups become main characters in later books of the series as the series progresses , some of the half-human species are discovered to have the potential to possess magical talents geographically , modern xanth resembles the state of florida in the united states in shape , but has landmarks that mimic well known geographical features from around the world many of xanth 's other geographical features are puns on those of florida ( for example , lake okeechobee and the kiss-mee river ) in other words , xanth does not have a fixed location or time in the mundane world ; and the timeline between xanth and mundania seems to jump backwards and forwards however , mundanes seem to have trouble finding xanth on a consistent basis , making any travel to xanth a somewhat rare occurrence whenever xanth characters visit the nonmagical land outside of xanth , called mundania , its natives ( mundanes ) speak what sounds like gibberish to the xanth characters they are believed to be the primary cause of several different settings in xanth : 1 ) the land of air , 2 ) the land of earth , 3 ) the land of fire , 4 ) the land of water ( also called the water wing ) , and 5 ) the void

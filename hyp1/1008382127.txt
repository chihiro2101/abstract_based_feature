in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy the iraqi ba'athists supported qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter iraq into the uar , enlarging the arab nationalist republic in retaliation , the ba'ath party tried to assassinate qasim in february 1959 , but the operation ( which was led by a young saddam hussein ) failed on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 the national consultative council was a forum made up of representatives from the party 's regional branches however , the number of national consultative council members were decided by the size of the regional branch the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world the national command had several bureaus , similar to those of the regional command of these , the national liaisons office was responsible for maintaining contact with the party 's regional branches a '' region '' ( quṭr ) , in ba'athist parlance , is an arab state such as syria , iraq , or lebanon the regional congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches ; other members attended , but as observers the regional command , similar to the branch command , operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions underneath the branch was the subbranch , which was made up of three to five sections , '' and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical congress however , unlike the civilian sector the military organization was controlled by a separate military bureau , and held periodical military congresses from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' '' to express his heartfelt belief in arab nationalism , aflaq coined the term '' one arab nation with an eternal message '' party ideology , and ba'athism in general , was not based on concepts such as the purity of the arab race or ethnic chauvinism , but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era the arab nation is considered , philosophically speaking , not as a social and economic formation , but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms , one of its highest contributions taking the form of islam issues such as these would only gain prominence when akram al-hawrani became a leading party figure , and when the '' transitional ba'athists '' took power however , the majority of ba'ath members were of rural upbringing the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) the third group , led by people disenchanted with both nasser and the union period , remained in the ba'ath party , stopped believing in the feasibility of pan-arabism many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule while its true that in 1962 the regionalists supported the slogan , adopted at the 5th national congress , '' the renewal of the union with egypt while taking note of past mistakes '' , they treated such a slogan as a propaganda slogan , and not as a feasible goal the disillusionment felt among party members on the pan-arab project , led to the radicalization of the party 's interpretation of socialism yasin al-hafiz , a former member of the syrian communist party , was an early frontrunner for the party 's radicalization hammud al-shufi became the leader of the party 's marxist faction during his short stint as syrian regional secretary , literally the head of the syrian regional organization radical socialists led by ali salih al-sadi took control of the iraqi regional branch in 1963 , which led to the official radicalization of the party 's ideology the concept of arab socialism , accused of being narrow-minded and nationalistic , was replaced with the '' arab road to socialism '' concept however , efraim karsh and inari rautsi contend that the regional branch was established in the 1940s , but that it received official recognition as a regional branch of the ba'ath party in 1952 by the national command at the time of 14 july revolution in 1958 , which overthrew the kingdom of iraq , the regional branch had 300 members the iraqi regional branch supported abd al-karim qasim 's rule on the grounds that he would seek iraq 's entry into the united arab republic at the 6th and 7th national congress , the regional branch elected razzaz to the national command at the 6th national congress , the lebanese regional branch elected jubrän majdalani and khalid al-ali to the national command the military committee did not show itself to the civilian wing of the party at this congress following the ba'ath party 's founding , regional branches were established in kuwait and saudi arabia

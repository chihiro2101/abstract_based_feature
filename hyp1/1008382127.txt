syrian arab republic . rule in syria , infighting , the 1966 coup and split : 1963–1966 the iraqi regional branch was increasingly dominated by ali salih al-sadi , a self-described marxism the marxist-wing gained new ground at the 6th national congress ( held in october 1963 ) , in which the iraqi and syrian regional branches called for the establishment of '' socialist planning '' , '' collective farms run by peasants '' , '' workers ' democratic control of the means of production '' , and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of soviet-style socialism aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals the coup sprung out of factional rivalry between jadid 's '' regionalist '' ( qutri ) camp , which promoted ambitions for a greater syria and the more traditionally pan-arab , in power faction , called the '' nationalist '' ( qawmi ) faction however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 the organizational structure ran from top to bottom , and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation—all contacts had to pass through a higher command level between national congresses , the national command was held accountable by the national consultative council ( arabic : al-majlis al-istishari al-quami ) however , the number of national consultative council members were decided by the size of the regional branch the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader before 1954 , the party was ruled by the executive committee , but this organ , along with others too , were replaced at the 2nd national congress national command sessions were held monthly a '' region '' ( quṭr ) , in ba'athist parlance , is an arab state such as syria , iraq , or lebanon the regional congress , which combined all the provincial branches , was the region 's highest authority and elected a regional command , the party leadership in a specific region , the regional tribunal , the body responsible for discipline inspection , and a regional secretary , the regional party leader the regional congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches ; other members attended , but as observers '' some subbranches were independent of central authority , and elected their own command and secretaries , while other subbranches were incorporated into the branches a division comprised two to seven circles , controlled by a division commander however , unlike the civilian sector the military organization was controlled by a separate military bureau , and held periodical military congresses an active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit , was given the right to vote in party elections , and could run for party office in the syrian regional branch a member had to spend 18 months as a supporter to be promoted to apprentice status , and then wait another 18 months to be promoted to active member status from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' the pan-arab tendencies of the party 's predecessor , the arab ba'ath movement , was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the zaki al-arsuzi 's arab ba'ath '' to express his heartfelt belief in arab nationalism , aflaq coined the term '' one arab nation with an eternal message '' according to middle east expert tabitha petran , the basic idea of the party 's ideology was ; that the arab nation is a permanent entity in history as hanna batatu notes , '' aflaq was basically urban in outlook '' while peasants and issues facing them are mentioned in some of aflaq 's work , there was scarcely any depth given to them or the issues facing them to take an example , in one instance aflaq states '' the national struggle after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) the third group , led by people disenchanted with both nasser and the union period , remained in the ba'ath party , stopped believing in the feasibility of pan-arabism many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule the provincial party members had not been told of the syrian regional branch 's dissolution , which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the national command yasin al-hafiz , a former member of the syrian communist party , was an early frontrunner for the party 's radicalization radical socialists led by ali salih al-sadi took control of the iraqi regional branch in 1963 , which led to the official radicalization of the party 's ideology during the existence of the uar , the regional branch was split into two factions , those supporting nasser and those opposing him at the 7th national congress the national command in collaboration with the military committee either expelled or removed leftists such as those found in the lebanese regional branch from leadership position , and in the most severe cases , expelled them from the party the lebanese regional branch managed to elect three members to the national command at the 7th national congress ; majdalani , al-ali and abd al-majid rafi

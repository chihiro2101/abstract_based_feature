other regional branches were established throughout the arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s , in , among others , iraq , yemen and jordan throughout its existence , the national command ( the body responsible for all-arab affairs ) , gave most attention to syrian affairs the 2nd national congress was convened in june 1954 , and elected a seven-man national command ; aflaq , bitar , and akram al-hawrani were elected and represented the syrian regional branch , while abdullah rimawi and abdallah na'was were elected to represent the jordanian branch the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country 90 percent of ba'ath party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy in retaliation , the ba'ath party tried to assassinate qasim in february 1959 , but the operation ( which was led by a young saddam hussein ) failed on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party the challenges of building a ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions the coup sprung out of factional rivalry between jadid 's '' regionalist '' ( qutri ) camp , which promoted ambitions for a greater syria and the more traditionally pan-arab , in power faction , called the '' nationalist '' ( qawmi ) faction the moderate faction , formerly led by aflaq and al-bitar , were purged from the party while it took some years , the 1966 coup resulted in the creation of two competing national commands , one syrian-dominated and another iraqi-dominated however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 between national congresses , the national command was held accountable by the national consultative council ( arabic : al-majlis al-istishari al-quami ) the national consultative council was a forum made up of representatives from the party 's regional branches however , the number of national consultative council members were decided by the size of the regional branch before 1954 , the party was ruled by the executive committee , but this organ , along with others too , were replaced at the 2nd national congress the national command had several bureaus , similar to those of the regional command the regional congress was responsible for evaluating the party 's performance since the last regional congress , while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period , which lasts until the next regional congress is held how long this period lasts is decided by the regional command the regional command , similar to the branch command , operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions the branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a command and a secretary ( leader ) the military organization was made up of branches similar to those in the ba'ath 's civilian sector an active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit , was given the right to vote in party elections , and could run for party office in the syrian regional branch a member had to spend 18 months as a supporter to be promoted to apprentice status , and then wait another 18 months to be promoted to active member status classical ba'ath : 1947–1960 from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' this nation has the natural right to live in a single state party ideology , and ba'athism in general , was not based on concepts such as the purity of the arab race or ethnic chauvinism , but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era this conception of the arab nation implicitly advantages the arab contribution to history when the akram al-hawrani 's arab socialist party ( asp ) merged with the ba'ath party , the majority of asp members of peasants origins did not join the ba'ath party , instead becoming personal followers of hawrani the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) however , being the unionist party that it was , the party 's leaders could not state their position on this issue the third group , led by people disenchanted with both nasser and the union period , remained in the ba'ath party , stopped believing in the feasibility of pan-arabism on 21 february 1962 , the national command issued a new policy regarding the pan-arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the uar , but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the uar as a decentralized federation with nasser 's egypt many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule when the syrian regional branch was reestablished , the majority of its members in the provinces were of communal origins–druze , alawi or ismaili hammud al-shufi became the leader of the party 's marxist faction during his short stint as syrian regional secretary , literally the head of the syrian regional organization radical socialists led by ali salih al-sadi took control of the iraqi regional branch in 1963 , which led to the official radicalization of the party 's ideology it elected a regional command and appointed rimawi as the branch 's regional secretary however , the regional branch leaders rimawi , na'was , gharbiyah and munif al-razzaz opposed such an idea , and because of it , shuqyar left the ba'ath party at the 6th national congress , the lebanese regional branch elected jubrän majdalani and khalid al-ali to the national command whatever the case , the syrian regional command slowly amassed its powers by weakening the national command

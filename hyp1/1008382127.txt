the party was founded on 7 april 1947 as the arab ba'ath party by michel aflaq ( an antiochian christian ) , salah al-din al-bitar ( a sunni muslim ) , and the followers of zaki al-arsuzi ( an atheist ) in damascus , syria , leading to the establishment of the syrian regional branch other regional branches were established throughout the arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s , in , among others , iraq , yemen and jordan the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party in iraq , the iraqi regional branch had supported abd al-karim qasim 's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the iraqi monarchy the iraqi ba'athists supported qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter iraq into the uar , enlarging the arab nationalist republic in retaliation , the ba'ath party tried to assassinate qasim in february 1959 , but the operation ( which was led by a young saddam hussein ) failed the cia official working with archie roosevelt , jr '' the iraqi regional branch , when it took power , was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in november 1963 a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic the challenges of building a ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions on 23 february 1966 , a coup d'état led by salah jadid , the informal head of the military committee , overthrew aflaq and the bitar 's cabinet the moderate faction , formerly led by aflaq and al-bitar , were purged from the party while it took some years , the 1966 coup resulted in the creation of two competing national commands , one syrian-dominated and another iraqi-dominated however , both in iraq and syria , the regional command became the real centre of party power , and the membership of the national command became a largely honorary position , often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership a consequence of the split was that zaki al-arsuzi took aflaq 's place as the official father of ba'athism in the pro-syrian ba'ath movement , while the pro-iraqi ba'ath movement still considered aflaq the de jure father of ba'athist thought the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 between national congresses , the national command was held accountable by the national consultative council ( arabic : al-majlis al-istishari al-quami ) the national consultative council was a forum made up of representatives from the party 's regional branches however , the number of national consultative council members were decided by the size of the regional branch the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader before 1954 , the party was ruled by the executive committee , but this organ , along with others too , were replaced at the 2nd national congress in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world a '' region '' ( quṭr ) , in ba'athist parlance , is an arab state such as syria , iraq , or lebanon the branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a command and a secretary ( leader ) underneath the branch was the subbranch , which was made up of three to five sections , '' and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical congress a section , which comprised two to five divisions , functioned at the level of a large city quarter , a town , or a rural district it elected its own command , composed of five members , but the subbranch appointed the command 's secretary however , unlike the civilian sector the military organization was controlled by a separate military bureau , and held periodical military congresses an active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit , was given the right to vote in party elections , and could run for party office from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' the pan-arab tendencies of the party 's predecessor , the arab ba'ath movement , was strengthened 1945–1947 by recruiting members from the zaki al-arsuzi 's arab ba'ath party ideology , and ba'athism in general , was not based on concepts such as the purity of the arab race or ethnic chauvinism , but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era according to middle east expert tabitha petran , the basic idea of the party 's ideology was ; that the arab nation is a permanent entity in history it was not islam that modeled the peoples of arabia , the fertile crescent , and north africa , equipping them with islamic values , especially the arabic language and the arabic culture , but the arab nation which created islam '' secondly , aflaq never had any official enmity towards the traditional landlords when the akram al-hawrani 's arab socialist party ( asp ) merged with the ba'ath party , the majority of asp members of peasants origins did not join the ba'ath party , instead becoming personal followers of hawrani the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology aflaq believed that the ba'ath party , at least in theory , would rule , and guide the people , in a transitional period of time without consulting the people , however he did support intra-party democracy the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) however , being the unionist party that it was , the party 's leaders could not state their position on this issue the end result was that the pro-arab nationalists within the ba'ath party became committed nasserists , while the more moderate arab nationalists founded the pro-nasserite socialist unionists party the disillusionment felt among party members on the pan-arab project , led to the radicalization of the party 's interpretation of socialism these repressive measures coupled with factionalism within the regional branch led to the november 1963 iraqi coup d'état by president arif and his nasserite supporters following the success of the ramadan revolution , led by the ba'ath party 's iraqi regional branch , the military committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against nazim al-kudsi 's presidency the military committee , which was itself a tiny minority of the already small ba'ath party membership , was forced to rule by force

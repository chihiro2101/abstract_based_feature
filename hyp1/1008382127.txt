the party was founded on 7 april 1947 as the arab ba'ath party by michel aflaq ( an antiochian christian ) , salah al-din al-bitar ( a sunni muslim ) , and the followers of zaki al-arsuzi ( an atheist ) in damascus , syria , leading to the establishment of the syrian regional branch other regional branches were established throughout the arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s , in , among others , iraq , yemen and jordan the 2nd national congress was convened in june 1954 , and elected a seven-man national command ; aflaq , bitar , and akram al-hawrani were elected and represented the syrian regional branch , while abdullah rimawi and abdallah na'was were elected to represent the jordanian branch the congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the arab socialist movement and the ba'ath party , which took place in 1952 the syrian regional branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s ; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the syrian regional branch won 22 seats in parliament , becoming the second largest party in the country the failure of the traditional parties represented by the people 's party and the national party , strengthened the ba'ath party 's public credibility through this position , the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet ; bitar was appointed minister of foreign affairs and khalil kallas became minister of economics its new , strengthened position , was used successfully to garner support for syria 's merger with gamal abdel nasser 's egypt , which led to the establishment of the united arab republic ( uar ) in 1958 on 24 june 1959 , fuad al-rikabi , the regional secretary of the iraqi regional branch , accused the national command of betraying arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the uar the congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the syrian regional branch , which had been decided by aflaq and bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958 , and for expelling rimawi , the regional secretary of the jordanian regional branch rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party , the arab socialist revolutionary ba'ath party , which established a rival national command to compete with the original the national command responded to the problems in iraq by appointing a temporary regional command on 2 february 1960 , which appointed talib el-shibib as regional secretary , and on 15 june 1961 the national command expelled rikabi from the party the iraqi ba'athists supported qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter iraq into the uar , enlarging the arab nationalist republic however , this was proven to be a ruse , and after taking power qasim launched an iraq first policy in retaliation , the ba'ath party tried to assassinate qasim in february 1959 , but the operation ( which was led by a young saddam hussein ) failed qasim was overthrown in the ramadan revolution led by young ba'athist officer ahmed hassan al-bakr , and rumoured to be supported by the american central intelligence agency ( cia ) declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate there was no direct american involvement , although the cia had been previously notified of an earlier ba'athist coup plot in july 1962 by a high-ranking informant within the party on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against qasim , and who later became the head of the cia 's operations in iraq and syria '' from late 1968 to june 1970 , '' has '' denied any involvement in the ba'ath party 's actions the 4th national congress , held in august 1960 , criticized the leadership of aflaq and bitar , called for the reestablishment of the syrian regional branch and deemphasized the party 's commitment to arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party a year after , at the uar 's nadir in syria , the syrian general abd al-karim al-nahlawi launched a coup on 28 september 1961 , which led to the reestablishment of the syrian arab republic the iraqi regional branch was increasingly dominated by ali salih al-sadi , a self-described marxism he was supported in his ideological reorientation by hammud al-shufi , the regional secretary of the syrian regional branch , yasin al-hafiz , one of the party ’ s few ideological theorists , and by certain members of the secret military committee aflaq , angry at this transformation of his party , retained a nominal leadership role , but the national command as a whole came under the control of the radicals in 1963 the ba'ath party seized power , from then on the ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized syrian political party , but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions on 23 february 1966 , a coup d'état led by salah jadid , the informal head of the military committee , overthrew aflaq and the bitar 's cabinet the coup sprung out of factional rivalry between jadid 's '' regionalist '' ( qutri ) camp , which promoted ambitions for a greater syria and the more traditionally pan-arab , in power faction , called the '' nationalist '' ( qawmi ) faction although he and his supporters had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the 6th party congress , they had now moved to adopt its positions the moderate faction , formerly led by aflaq and al-bitar , were purged from the party the organizational structure of the ba'ath party was created at the 2nd national congress by amending the party 's internal regulations , which was approved at the party 's 1st national congress in 1947 the national command was the ruling organ of the party between sessions of the national congress , and was headed by a secretary-general the national congress elected the national command , national tribunal , the party 's discipline body , and the secretary-general , the party leader in ba'athist jargon '' nation '' means the arab nation , because of that , the national command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the ba'ath movement throughout the arab world a '' region '' ( quṭr ) , in ba'athist parlance , is an arab state such as syria , iraq , or lebanon the branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a command and a secretary ( leader ) underneath the branch was the subbranch , which was made up of three to five sections , '' and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical congress the military organization was made up of branches similar to those in the ba'ath 's civilian sector there existed three types of membership categories in the ba'ath party ; active member ( arabic : udw ämil ) , apprentice member ( arabic : udw mutadarrib ) and supporter ( arabic : firqa ) an active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit , was given the right to vote in party elections , and could run for party office in the syrian regional branch a member had to spend 18 months as a supporter to be promoted to apprentice status , and then wait another 18 months to be promoted to active member status from its very beginning , the party was a manifestation of arab nationalist thought , with the party itself referring to itself as '' the party of arab unity '' as such , the arab fatherland constitutes an indivisible political and economic unit the '' transitional ba'ath '' , which grew out of the dissolution of the syrian regional branch in 1958 dissolution and the military committee , were more rural in outlook , policy and ideology aflaq believed that the ba'ath party , at least in theory , would rule , and guide the people , in a transitional period of time without consulting the people , however he did support intra-party democracy the last tenet , 'socialism ' , did not mean socialism as it is defined in the west , but rather a unique form of arab socialism the original interpretation of arab socialism did not answer questions such as : how much state control was necessary , or economic equality ; but instead focused on freeing the arab nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general after the failure of the united arab republic ( uar ) , a union of egypt and syria , the ba'ath party was divided into two main factions , the regionalists and the nationalists ( pan-arab ) when the union with egypt collapsed , the ba'ath party was put in a difficult position , the party still sought arab unity , but did not oppose the uar 's dissolution and did not want to seek another union with egypt under gamal abdel nasser 's rule the end result was that the pro-arab nationalists within the ba'ath party became committed nasserists , while the more moderate arab nationalists founded the pro-nasserite socialist unionists party many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy , with many members being both disenchanted with pan-arabism and aflaq 's continued party rule iraq expert malik mufti believes aflaq may have supported arif 's coup because it weakened al-sadi 's position within the party and strengthened his own rimawi and na'was were elected to the national command at the 2nd national congress ( held in 1952 ) on 17 july 1961 a group of rival ba'athists led by rimawi opened fire on several of the regional branch 's members aside from the syrian communist party ( scp ) , the ba'ath party was the only party able to organise mass protests among workers following the success of the ramadan revolution , led by the ba'ath party 's iraqi regional branch , the military committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against nazim al-kudsi 's presidency the saudi regional branches elected ali ghannäm to represent them at the 7th national command

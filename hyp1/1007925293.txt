one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear the findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues , the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder web increased instances of violent and antisocial behavior are also associated with the condition ; examples may range from pushing , hitting and biting when the child is young , progressing towards beating and inflicted cruelty as the child becomes older conduct disorder can present with limited prosocial emotions , lack of remorse or guilt , lack of empathy , lack of concern for performance , and shallow or deficient affect currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder specifically , children in this group have greater levels of adhd symptoms , neuropsychological deficits , more academic problems , increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence there is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder a premature diagnosis made in young children , and thus labeling and stigmatizing an individual , may be inappropriate it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset , suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence , such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult in fact , the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15 however , again , only 25-40 % of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder nonetheless , many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors specifically , risk factors associated with conduct disorder and the effects of conduct disorder symptomatology on a child 's psychosocial context have been linked to overlap with other psychological disorders adhd is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders , with approximately 25-30 % of boys and 50-55 % of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid adhd diagnosis while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems moreover , children with comorbid conduct disorder and adhd show more severe aggression conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse however , a correlation between a particular risk factor and a later developmental outcome ( such as conduct disorder ) can not be taken as definitive evidence for a causal link thus , the genes that dispose the mother to sdp may also dispose the child to cd following mitotic transmission however , confounding variables , such as language deficits , ses disadvantage , or neurodevelopmental delay also need to be considered in this relationship , as they could help explain some of the association between conduct disorder and learning problems the neuropsychology of conduct disorder and delinquency : implications for understanding antisocial behavior for instance , antisocial behavior suggestive of conduct disorder is associated with single parent status , parental divorce , large family size , and young age of mothers peer rejection is not only a marker of a number of externalizing disorders , but also a contributing factor for the continuity of the disorders over time about 25-40 % of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood moreover , conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes , such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy , suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood

one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality ( fear ) predicts toddlers ' empathy-related response to distress the findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues , the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder '' toddlers ' empathy-related responding to distress : predictions from negative emotionality and maternal behavior in infancy often bullies , threatens , or intimidates others often initiates physical fights has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others ( e.g , a bat , brick , broken bottle , knife , gun ) has been physically cruel to people has been physically cruel to animals has stolen while confronting a victim ( e.g currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder the first is known as the '' childhood-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years there is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder the characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder specifically , research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder , and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder in fact , only about 25 % of children with oppositional defiant disorder will receive a later diagnosis of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult in fact , the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15 however , again , only 25-40 % of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder nonetheless , many of the individuals who do not meet full criteria for antisocial personality disorder still exhibit a pattern of social and personal impairments or antisocial behaviors adhd is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders , with approximately 25-30 % of boys and 50-55 % of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid adhd diagnosis while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder as mentioned above , it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems , such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use , which leads to increased aggressive behavior substance use in conduct disorder can lead to antisocial behavior in adulthood compared to normal controls , youths with early and adolescent onset of conduct disorder displayed reduced responses in brain regions associated with social behavior ( i.e having a sibling or parent with conduct disorder increases the likelihood of having the disorder , with a heritability rate of almost all adolescents who have a substance use disorder have conduct disorder-like traits , but after successful treatment of the substance use disorder , about half of these adolescents no longer display conduct disorder-like symptoms about 25-40 % of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood however , according to studies on american youth , it appears that african-american youth are more often diagnosed with conduct disorder , while asian-american youth are about one-third as likely to develop conduct disorder when compared to white american youth

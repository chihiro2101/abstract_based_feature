one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear research performed on the impact of toddlers exposed to fear and distress shows that negative emotionality ( fear ) predicts toddlers ' empathy-related response to distress if a child does not learn how to handle fear or distress the child will be more likely to lash out at other children if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder often bullies , threatens , or intimidates others often initiates physical fights has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others ( e.g , a bat , brick , broken bottle , knife , gun ) has been physically cruel to people has been physically cruel to animals has stolen while confronting a victim ( e.g currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder there is debate among professionals regarding the validity and appropriateness of diagnosing young children with conduct disorder it is also argued that some children may not in fact have conduct disorder , but are engaging in developmentally appropriate disruptive behavior the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years specifically , research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder , and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult however , again , only 25-40 % of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder specifically , risk factors associated with conduct disorder and the effects of conduct disorder symptomatology on a child 's psychosocial context have been linked to overlap with other psychological disorders in this way , there seems to be reciprocal effects of comorbidity with certain disorders , leading to increased overall risk for these youth adhd is the condition most commonly associated with conduct disorders , with approximately 25-30 % of boys and 50-55 % of girls with conduct disorder having a comorbid adhd diagnosis while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder as mentioned above , it seems that there is a transactional relationship between substance use and conduct problems , such that aggressive behaviors increase substance use , which leads to increased aggressive behavior clinical handbook of assessing and treating conduct problems in youth these factors may also vary based on the age of onset , with different variables related to early ( e.g the development of conduct disorder is not immutable or predetermined a number of interactive risk and protective factors exist that can influence and change outcomes , and in most cases conduct disorder develops due to an interaction and gradual accumulation of risk factors however , a correlation between a particular risk factor and a later developmental outcome ( such as conduct disorder ) can not be taken as definitive evidence for a causal link beyond difficulties in executive function , neurological research on youth with conduct disorder also demonstrate differences in brain anatomy and function that reflect the behaviors and mental anomalies associated in conduct disorder in addition to the individual and social factors associated with conduct disorder , research has highlighted the importance of environment and context in youth with antisocial behavior almost all adolescents who have a substance use disorder have conduct disorder-like traits , but after successful treatment of the substance use disorder , about half of these adolescents no longer display conduct disorder-like symptoms about 25-40 % of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood however , according to studies on american youth , it appears that african-american youth are more often diagnosed with conduct disorder , while asian-american youth are about one-third as likely to develop conduct disorder when compared to white american youth

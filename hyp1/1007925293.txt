one of the symptoms of conduct disorder is a lower level of fear the findings support that if a caregiver is able to respond to infant cues , the toddler has a better ability to respond to fear and distress if the caregiver is able to provide therapeutic intervention teaching children at risk better empathy skills , the child will have a lower incident level of conduct disorder '' toddlers ' empathy-related responding to distress : predictions from negative emotionality and maternal behavior in infancy often bullies , threatens , or intimidates others often initiates physical fights has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others ( e.g , mugging , purse snatching , extortion , armed robbery ) has forced someone into sexual activity ( rape or molestation ) has deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage has deliberately destroyed others ' property ( other than by fire setting ) , '' cons '' others ) has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim ( e.g currently , two possible developmental courses are thought to lead to conduct disorder the first is known as the '' childhood-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of 10 years this course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors specifically , children in this group have greater levels of adhd symptoms , neuropsychological deficits , more academic problems , increased family dysfunction and higher likelihood of aggression and violence the characteristics of the diagnosis are commonly seen in young children who are referred to mental health professionals the second developmental course is known as the '' adolescent-onset type '' and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present after the age of 10 years individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder exhibit less impairment than those with the childhood-onset type and are not characterized by similar psychopathology research has shown that there is a greater number of children with adolescent-onset conduct disorder than those with childhood-onset , suggesting that adolescent-onset conduct disorder is an exaggeration of developmental behaviors that are typically seen in adolescence , such as rebellion against authority figures and rejection of conventional values however , this argument is not established and empirical research suggests that these subgroups are not as valid as once thought in addition to these two courses that are recognized by the dsm-iv-tr , there appears to be a relationship among oppositional defiant disorder , conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder specifically , research has demonstrated continuity in the disorders such that conduct disorder is often diagnosed in children who have been previously diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder , and most adults with antisocial personality disorder were previously diagnosed with conduct disorder for example , some research has shown that 90 % of children diagnosed with conduct disorder had a previous diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder moreover , both disorders share relevant risk factors and disruptive behaviors , suggesting that oppositional defiant disorder is a developmental precursor and milder variant of conduct disorder correspondingly , there is an established link between conduct disorder and the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder as an adult in fact , the current diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder require a conduct disorder diagnosis before the age of 15 however , again , only 25-40 % of youths with conduct disorder will develop antisocial personality disorder these developmental trajectories suggest the existence of antisocial pathways in certain individuals , which have important implications for both research and treatment while it is unlikely that adhd alone is a risk factor for developing conduct disorder , children who exhibit hyperactivity and impulsivity along with aggression is associated with the early onset of conduct problems conduct disorder is also highly associated with both substance use and abuse however , substance use disorders themselves can directly or indirectly cause conduct disorder like traits in about half of adolescents who have a substance use disorder substance use in conduct disorder can lead to antisocial behavior in adulthood it is diagnosed based on a prolonged pattern of antisocial behaviour such as serious violation of laws and social norms and rules in people younger than the age of 18 about 25-40 % of youths diagnosed with conduct disorder qualify for a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder when they reach adulthood moreover , conduct disorder in females is linked to several negative outcomes , such as antisocial personality disorder and early pregnancy , suggesting that sex differences in disruptive behaviors need to be more fully understood

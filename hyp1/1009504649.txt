mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes the first mirna was discovered in 1993 by a group led by ambros and including lee and feinbaum these groups published back-to-back papers on the lin-4 gene , which was known to control the timing of c isolated the lin-4 mirna , they found that instead of producing an mrna encoding a protein , it produced short non-coding rnas , one of which was a ~22-nucleotide rna that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3 ' utr of the lin-14 mrna in 2000 , a second small rna was characterized : let-7 rna , which represses lin-41 to promote a later developmental transition in c the let-7 rna was found to be conserved in many species , leading to the suggestion that let-7 rna and additional '' small temporal rnas '' might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals , including humans a year later , the lin-4 and let-7 rnas were found to be part of a large class of small rnas present in c a capitalized '' mir- '' refers to the mature form of the mirna , while the uncapitalized '' mir- '' refers to the pre-mirna and the -mirna mirnas with nearly identical sequences except for one or two nucleotides are annotated with an additional lower case letter for example , the pre-mirnas -mir-194-1 and -mir-194-2 lead to an identical mature mirna -mir-194 ) but are from genes located in different genome regions other common prefixes include '' v '' for viral ( mirna encoded by a viral genome ) and '' d '' for drosophila mirna ( a fruit fly commonly studied in genetic research ) when two mature micrornas originate from opposite arms of the same pre-mirna and are found in roughly similar amounts , they are denoted with a -3p or -5p suffix however , the mature microrna found from one arm of the hairpin is usually much more abundant than that found from the other arm , in which case , an asterisk following the name indicates the mature species found at low levels from the opposite arm of a hairpin for example , mir-124 and mir-124 share a pre-mirna hairpin , but much more mir-124 is found in the cell plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts in contrast , animal mirnas are able to recognize their target mrnas by using as few as 6–8 nucleotides ( the seed region ) at the 5 ' end of the mirna , which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mrnas estimates of the average number of unique messenger rnas that are targets for repression by a typical mirna vary , depending on the estimation method , but multiple approaches show that mammalian mirnas can have many unique targets likewise , experiments show that a single mirna species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique messenger rnas these are usually , though not exclusively , found in a sense orientation , and thus usually are regulated together with their host genes the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna the polymerase often binds to a promoter found near the dna sequence , encoding what will become the hairpin loop of the pre-mirna dgcr8 associates with the enzyme drosha , a protein that cuts rna , to form the microprocessor complex in this complex , dgcr8 orients the catalytic rnase iii domain of drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-mirnas by cleaving rna about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base ( one helical dsrna turn into the stem ) sequence motifs downstream of the pre-mirna that are important for efficient processing have been identified this protein , a member of the karyopherin , recognizes a two-nucleotide overhang left by the rnase iii enzyme drosha at the 3 ' end of the pre-mirna hairpin overall hairpin length and loop size influence the efficiency of dicer processing although either strand of the duplex may potentially act as a functional mirna , only one strand is usually incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) where the mirna and its mrna target interact instead of being cleaved by two different enzymes , once inside and once outside the nucleus , both cleavages of the plant mirna are performed by a dicer homolog , called dicer-like1 ( dl1 ) before plant mirna : mirna duplexes are transported out of the nucleus , its 3 ' overhangs are methylated by a methyltransferase called hua-enhancer1 ( hen1 ) the mature mirna is part of an active rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) containing dicer and many associated proteins risc is also known as a microrna ribonucleoprotein complex ( mirnp ) ; a risc with incorporated mirna is sometimes referred to as a '' mirisc perfect or near perfect base pairing with the target rna promotes cleavage of the rna decreased expression of mir-155 , mir-221 , and mir-222 , have been found during the adipogenic programming of both immortalized and primary hmscs , suggesting that they act as negative regulators of differentiation conversely , ectopic expression of the mirnas 155,221 , and 222 significantly inhibited adipogenesis and repressed induction of the master regulators pparγ and ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha ( cebpa ) viral micrornas play an important role in the regulation of gene expression of viral and/or host genes to benefit the virus mirnas can bind to target messenger rna ( mrna ) transcripts of protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause mrna degradation

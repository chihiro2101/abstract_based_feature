however , mirnas were not recognized as a distinct class of biological regulators until the early 2000s mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes the first mirna was discovered in 1993 by a group led by ambros and including lee and feinbaum isolated the lin-4 mirna , they found that instead of producing an mrna encoding a protein , it produced short non-coding rnas , one of which was a ~22-nucleotide rna that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3 ' utr of the lin-14 mrna this complementarity was proposed to inhibit the translation of the lin-14 mrna into the lin-14 protein in 2000 , a second small rna was characterized : let-7 rna , which represses lin-41 to promote a later developmental transition in c the let-7 rna was found to be conserved in many species , leading to the suggestion that let-7 rna and additional '' small temporal rnas '' might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals , including humans a year later , the lin-4 and let-7 rnas were found to be part of a large class of small rnas present in c for examples , the official mirnas gene names in some organisms are “ mir-1 in c mirnas with nearly identical sequences except for one or two nucleotides are annotated with an additional lower case letter for example : : hsa-mir-181a : : hsa-mir-181b : pre-mirnas , -mirnas and genes that lead to 100 % identical mature mirnas but that are located at different places in the genome are indicated with an additional dash-number suffix for example , the pre-mirnas -mir-194-1 and -mir-194-2 lead to an identical mature mirna -mir-194 ) but are from genes located in different genome regions , -mir-124 is a human ( homo sapiens ) mirna and oar-mir-124 is a sheep ( ovis aries ) mirna other common prefixes include '' v '' for viral ( mirna encoded by a viral genome ) and '' d '' for drosophila mirna ( a fruit fly commonly studied in genetic research ) when two mature micrornas originate from opposite arms of the same pre-mirna and are found in roughly similar amounts , they are denoted with a -3p or -5p suffix for example , mir-124 and mir-124 share a pre-mirna hairpin , but much more mir-124 is found in the cell plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts likewise , experiments show that a single mirna species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique messenger rnas the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna animal mirnas are initially transcribed as part of one arm of an ∼80 nucleotide rna stem-loop that in turn forms part of a several hundred nucleotide-long mirna precursor termed a pri-mirna when a stem-loop precursor is found in the 3 ' utr , a transcript may serve as a pri-mirna and a mrna a single pri-mirna may contain from one to six mirna precursors in this complex , dgcr8 orients the catalytic rnase iii domain of drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-mirnas by cleaving rna about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base ( one helical dsrna turn into the stem ) rna editing can halt nuclear processing ( for example , of pri-mir-142 , leading to degradation by the ribonuclease tudor-sn ) and alter downstream processes including cytoplasmic mirna processing and target specificity ( e.g this endoribonuclease interacts with 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the hairpin and cuts away the loop joining the 3 ' and 5 ' arms , yielding an imperfect mirna : mirna duplex about 22 nucleotides in length although either strand of the duplex may potentially act as a functional mirna , only one strand is usually incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) where the mirna and its mrna target interact instead of being cleaved by two different enzymes , once inside and once outside the nucleus , both cleavages of the plant mirna are performed by a dicer homolog , called dicer-like1 ( dl1 ) before plant mirna : mirna duplexes are transported out of the nucleus , its 3 ' overhangs are methylated by a methyltransferase called hua-enhancer1 ( hen1 ) the mature mirna is part of an active rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) containing dicer and many associated proteins the other strand , called the passenger strand due to its lower levels in the steady state , is denoted with an asterisk ( ) and is normally degraded however , uridylation may also protect some mirnas ; the consequences of this modification are incompletely understood both plant and animal mirnas may be altered by addition of adenine ( a ) residues to the 3 ' end of the mirna animal mirnas inhibit protein translation of the target mrna ( this is present but less common in plants ) the vital role of mirnas in gene expression is significant to addiction , specifically alcoholism up to 35 different mirnas have been found to be altered in the alcoholic post-mortem brain , all of which target genes that include the regulation of the cell cycle , apoptosis , cell adhesion , neural development and cell signaling large scale studies of functional mirna targeting suggest that many functional mirnas can be missed by target prediction algorithms .

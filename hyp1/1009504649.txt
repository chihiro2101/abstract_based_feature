however , mirnas were not recognized as a distinct class of biological regulators until the early 2000s mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes the first mirna was discovered in 1993 by a group led by ambros and including lee and feinbaum in 2000 , a second small rna was characterized : let-7 rna , which represses lin-41 to promote a later developmental transition in c the let-7 rna was found to be conserved in many species , leading to the suggestion that let-7 rna and additional '' small temporal rnas '' might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals , including humans a year later , the lin-4 and let-7 rnas were found to be part of a large class of small rnas present in c the many rnas of this class resembled the lin-4 and let-7 rnas , except their expression patterns were usually inconsistent with a role in regulating the timing of development the first human disease associated with deregulation of mirnas was chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in this disorder the mirnas have a dual role working as both tumor suppressors and oncogene the prefix '' mir '' is followed by a dash and a number , the latter often indicating order of naming a capitalized '' mir- '' refers to the mature form of the mirna , while the uncapitalized '' mir- '' refers to the pre-mirna and the -mirna for examples , the official mirnas gene names in some organisms are â€œ mir-1 in c for example : : hsa-mir-181a : : hsa-mir-181b : pre-mirnas , -mirnas and genes that lead to 100 % identical mature mirnas but that are located at different places in the genome are indicated with an additional dash-number suffix for example , the pre-mirnas -mir-194-1 and -mir-194-2 lead to an identical mature mirna -mir-194 ) but are from genes located in different genome regions , -mir-124 is a human ( homo sapiens ) mirna and oar-mir-124 is a sheep ( ovis aries ) mirna however , the mature microrna found from one arm of the hairpin is usually much more abundant than that found from the other arm , in which case , an asterisk following the name indicates the mature species found at low levels from the opposite arm of a hairpin plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts a given mirna may have hundreds of different mrna targets , and a given target might be regulated by multiple mirnas estimates of the average number of unique messenger rnas that are targets for repression by a typical mirna vary , depending on the estimation method , but multiple approaches show that mammalian mirnas can have many unique targets for example , an analysis of the mirnas highly conserved in vertebrates shows that each has , on average , roughly 400 conserved targets other experiments show that a single mirna species may repress the production of hundreds of proteins , but that this repression often is relatively mild ( much less than 2-fold ) as many as 40 % of mirna genes may lie in the introns or even exons of other genes the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna the polymerase often binds to a promoter found near the dna sequence , encoding what will become the hairpin loop of the pre-mirna when a stem-loop precursor is found in the 3 ' utr , a transcript may serve as a pri-mirna and a mrna dgcr8 associates with the enzyme drosha , a protein that cuts rna , to form the microprocessor complex as many as 16 % of pre-mirnas may be altered through nuclear rna editing in the cytoplasm , the pre-mirna hairpin is cleaved by the rnase iii enzyme dicer the imperfect nature of the mirna : mirna pairing also affects cleavage while the majority of mirnas are located within the cell , some mirnas , commonly known as circulating mirnas or extracellular mirnas , have also been found in extracellular environment , including various biological fluids and cell culture media mirna biogenesis in plants differs from animal biogenesis mainly in the steps of nuclear processing and export instead of being cleaved by two different enzymes , once inside and once outside the nucleus , both cleavages of the plant mirna are performed by a dicer homolog , called dicer-like1 ( dl1 ) the mature mirna is part of an active rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) containing dicer and many associated proteins for example , mir16 contains a sequence complementary to the au-rich element found in the 3'utr of many unstable mrnas , such as tnf alpha or gm-csf an extra a added to the end of mammalian mir-122 , a liver-enriched mirna important in hepatitis c , stabilizes the molecule and plant mirnas ending with an adenine residue have slower decay rates mirnas also play crucial roles in the regulation of complex enzymatic cascades including the hemostatic blood coagulation system mirnas can bind to target messenger rna ( mrna ) transcripts of protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause mrna degradation

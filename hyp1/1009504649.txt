however , mirnas were not recognized as a distinct class of biological regulators until the early 2000s mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes the first mirna was discovered in 1993 by a group led by ambros and including lee and feinbaum however , additional insight into its mode of action required simultaneously published work by ruvkun 's team , including wightman and ha these groups published back-to-back papers on the lin-4 gene , which was known to control the timing of c a year later , the lin-4 and let-7 rnas were found to be part of a large class of small rnas present in c at this point , researchers started using the term '' microrna '' to refer to this class of small regulatory rnas the first human disease associated with deregulation of mirnas was chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in this disorder the mirnas have a dual role working as both tumor suppressors and oncogene the prefix '' mir '' is followed by a dash and a number , the latter often indicating order of naming a capitalized '' mir- '' refers to the mature form of the mirna , while the uncapitalized '' mir- '' refers to the pre-mirna and the -mirna the mirnas encoding genes are also named using the same three-letter prefix according to the conventions of the organism gene nomenclature mirnas with nearly identical sequences except for one or two nucleotides are annotated with an additional lower case letter for example : : hsa-mir-181a : : hsa-mir-181b : pre-mirnas , -mirnas and genes that lead to 100 % identical mature mirnas but that are located at different places in the genome are indicated with an additional dash-number suffix , -mir-124 is a human ( homo sapiens ) mirna and oar-mir-124 is a sheep ( ovis aries ) mirna other common prefixes include '' v '' for viral ( mirna encoded by a viral genome ) and '' d '' for drosophila mirna ( a fruit fly commonly studied in genetic research ) plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts in contrast , animal mirnas are able to recognize their target mrnas by using as few as 6â€“8 nucleotides ( the seed region ) at the 5 ' end of the mirna , which is not enough pairing to induce cleavage of the target mrnas the first human disease discovered to be associated with deregulation of mirnas was chronic lymphoid leukemia as many as 40 % of mirna genes may lie in the introns or even exons of other genes these are usually , though not exclusively , found in a sense orientation , and thus usually are regulated together with their host genes the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna the resulting transcript is 5 ' cap with a specially modified nucleotide at the 5 ' end , polyadenylated with multiple adenosines ( a poly ( a ) tail ) , and spliced a single pri-mirna may contain from one to six mirna precursors dgcr8 associates with the enzyme drosha , a protein that cuts rna , to form the microprocessor complex in this complex , dgcr8 orients the catalytic rnase iii domain of drosha to liberate hairpins from pri-mirnas by cleaving rna about eleven nucleotides from the hairpin base ( one helical dsrna turn into the stem ) sequence motifs downstream of the pre-mirna that are important for efficient processing have been identified elegans , mirtrons have now been found in mammals most commonly , enzymes known as adenosine deaminases acting on rna ( adars ) catalyze adenosine to inosine ( a to i ) transitions this protein , a member of the karyopherin , recognizes a two-nucleotide overhang left by the rnase iii enzyme drosha at the 3 ' end of the pre-mirna hairpin this endoribonuclease interacts with 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the hairpin and cuts away the loop joining the 3 ' and 5 ' arms , yielding an imperfect mirna : mirna duplex about 22 nucleotides in length the imperfect nature of the mirna : mirna pairing also affects cleavage for example , human pre-mirna 92b adopts a g-quadruplex structure which is resistant to the dicer mediated cleavage in the cytoplasm members of the argonaute ( ago ) protein family are central to risc function mirnas occasionally also cause histone modification and dna methylation of promoter sites , which affects the expression of target genes mirnas can bind to target messenger rna ( mrna ) transcripts of protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause mrna degradation large scale studies of functional mirna targeting suggest that many functional mirnas can be missed by target prediction algorithms .

however , mirnas were not recognized as a distinct class of biological regulators until the early 2000s mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes however , additional insight into its mode of action required simultaneously published work by ruvkun 's team , including wightman and ha these groups published back-to-back papers on the lin-4 gene , which was known to control the timing of c isolated the lin-4 mirna , they found that instead of producing an mrna encoding a protein , it produced short non-coding rnas , one of which was a ~22-nucleotide rna that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3 ' utr of the lin-14 mrna in 2000 , a second small rna was characterized : let-7 rna , which represses lin-41 to promote a later developmental transition in c the let-7 rna was found to be conserved in many species , leading to the suggestion that let-7 rna and additional '' small temporal rnas '' might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals , including humans the many rnas of this class resembled the lin-4 and let-7 rnas , except their expression patterns were usually inconsistent with a role in regulating the timing of development at this point , researchers started using the term '' microrna '' to refer to this class of small regulatory rnas the first human disease associated with deregulation of mirnas was chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in this disorder the mirnas have a dual role working as both tumor suppressors and oncogene for examples , the official mirnas gene names in some organisms are “ mir-1 in c mirnas with nearly identical sequences except for one or two nucleotides are annotated with an additional lower case letter for example , the pre-mirnas -mir-194-1 and -mir-194-2 lead to an identical mature mirna -mir-194 ) but are from genes located in different genome regions plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts a given mirna may have hundreds of different mrna targets , and a given target might be regulated by multiple mirnas estimates of the average number of unique messenger rnas that are targets for repression by a typical mirna vary , depending on the estimation method , but multiple approaches show that mammalian mirnas can have many unique targets as many as 40 % of mirna genes may lie in the introns or even exons of other genes the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna the polymerase often binds to a promoter found near the dna sequence , encoding what will become the hairpin loop of the pre-mirna animal mirnas are initially transcribed as part of one arm of an ∼80 nucleotide rna stem-loop that in turn forms part of a several hundred nucleotide-long mirna precursor termed a pri-mirna as many as 16 % of pre-mirnas may be altered through nuclear rna editing most commonly , enzymes known as adenosine deaminases acting on rna ( adars ) catalyze adenosine to inosine ( a to i ) transitions rna editing can halt nuclear processing ( for example , of pri-mir-142 , leading to degradation by the ribonuclease tudor-sn ) and alter downstream processes including cytoplasmic mirna processing and target specificity ( e.g this endoribonuclease interacts with 5 ' and 3 ' ends of the hairpin and cuts away the loop joining the 3 ' and 5 ' arms , yielding an imperfect mirna : mirna duplex about 22 nucleotides in length dl1 is expressed only in the nucleus of plant cells , which indicates that both reactions take place inside the nucleus risc is also known as a microrna ribonucleoprotein complex ( mirnp ) ; a risc with incorporated mirna is sometimes referred to as a '' mirisc in some cases , both strands of the duplex are viable and become functional mirna that target different mrna populations gene silencing may occur either via mrna degradation or preventing mrna from being translated some mirnas work as buffers of random gene expression changes arising due to stochastic events in transcription , translation and protein stability in what has been called a '' use it or lose it '' strategy , argonaute may preferentially retain mirnas with many targets over mirnas with few or no targets , leading to degradation of the non-targeting molecules as indicated by work in the model organism arabidopsis thaliana ( thale cress ) , mature plant mirnas appear to be stabilized by the addition of methyl moieties at the 3 ' end however , uridylation may also protect some mirnas ; the consequences of this modification are incompletely understood an extra a added to the end of mammalian mir-122 , a liver-enriched mirna important in hepatitis c , stabilizes the molecule and plant mirnas ending with an adenine residue have slower decay rates mirnas occasionally also cause histone modification and dna methylation of promoter sites , which affects the expression of target genes in contrast when let-7 was inhibited by injections of let-7-specific antagomirs , mice become more insulin-sensitive and remarkably resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes mirnas can bind to target messenger rna ( mrna ) transcripts of protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause mrna degradation

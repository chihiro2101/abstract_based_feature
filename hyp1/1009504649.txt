mirna research revealed different sets of mirnas expressed in different cell types and tissues and multiple roles for mirnas in plant and animal development and in many other biological processes however , additional insight into its mode of action required simultaneously published work by ruvkun 's team , including wightman and ha these groups published back-to-back papers on the lin-4 gene , which was known to control the timing of c isolated the lin-4 mirna , they found that instead of producing an mrna encoding a protein , it produced short non-coding rnas , one of which was a ~22-nucleotide rna that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3 ' utr of the lin-14 mrna in 2000 , a second small rna was characterized : let-7 rna , which represses lin-41 to promote a later developmental transition in c the let-7 rna was found to be conserved in many species , leading to the suggestion that let-7 rna and additional '' small temporal rnas '' might regulate the timing of development in diverse animals , including humans a year later , the lin-4 and let-7 rnas were found to be part of a large class of small rnas present in c at this point , researchers started using the term '' microrna '' to refer to this class of small regulatory rnas the first human disease associated with deregulation of mirnas was chronic lymphocytic leukemia.in this disorder the mirnas have a dual role working as both tumor suppressors and oncogene under a standard nomenclature system , names are assigned to experimentally confirmed mirnas before publication for examples , the official mirnas gene names in some organisms are â€œ mir-1 in c mirnas with nearly identical sequences except for one or two nucleotides are annotated with an additional lower case letter for example : : hsa-mir-181a : : hsa-mir-181b : pre-mirnas , -mirnas and genes that lead to 100 % identical mature mirnas but that are located at different places in the genome are indicated with an additional dash-number suffix for example , the pre-mirnas -mir-194-1 and -mir-194-2 lead to an identical mature mirna -mir-194 ) but are from genes located in different genome regions species of origin is designated with a three-letter prefix , e.g however , the mature microrna found from one arm of the hairpin is usually much more abundant than that found from the other arm , in which case , an asterisk following the name indicates the mature species found at low levels from the opposite arm of a hairpin for example , mir-124 and mir-124 share a pre-mirna hairpin , but much more mir-124 is found in the cell plant mirnas usually have near-perfect pairing with their mrna targets , which induces gene repression through cleavage of the target transcripts a given mirna may have hundreds of different mrna targets , and a given target might be regulated by multiple mirnas for example , an analysis of the mirnas highly conserved in vertebrates shows that each has , on average , roughly 400 conserved targets other b cell malignancies followed as many as 40 % of mirna genes may lie in the introns or even exons of other genes these are usually , though not exclusively , found in a sense orientation , and thus usually are regulated together with their host genes the dna template is not the final word on mature mirna production : 6 % of human mirnas show rna editing ( isomir ) , the site-specific modification of rna sequences to yield products different from those encoded by their dna mirna genes are usually transcribed by rna polymerase ii ( pol ii ) rna polymerase iii ( pol iii ) transcribes some mirnas , especially those with upstream alu sequences , transfer rnas ( trnas ) , and mammalian wide interspersed repeat ( mwir ) promoter units dgcr8 associates with the enzyme drosha , a protein that cuts rna , to form the microprocessor complex pre-mirnas that are spliced directly out of introns , bypassing the microprocessor complex , are known as '' mirtrons most commonly , enzymes known as adenosine deaminases acting on rna ( adars ) catalyze adenosine to inosine ( a to i ) transitions while the majority of mirnas are located within the cell , some mirnas , commonly known as circulating mirnas or extracellular mirnas , have also been found in extracellular environment , including various biological fluids and cell culture media some argonautes , for example human ago2 , cleave target transcripts directly ; argonautes may also recruit additional proteins to achieve translational repression in what has been called a '' use it or lose it '' strategy , argonaute may preferentially retain mirnas with many targets over mirnas with few or no targets , leading to degradation of the non-targeting molecules as indicated by work in the model organism arabidopsis thaliana ( thale cress ) , mature plant mirnas appear to be stabilized by the addition of methyl moieties at the 3 ' end up to 35 different mirnas have been found to be altered in the alcoholic post-mortem brain , all of which target genes that include the regulation of the cell cycle , apoptosis , cell adhesion , neural development and cell signaling mirnas also play crucial roles in the regulation of complex enzymatic cascades including the hemostatic blood coagulation system mirnas can bind to target messenger rna ( mrna ) transcripts of protein-coding genes and negatively control their translation or cause mrna degradation

however the portrait display was quickly eliminated because it would have been too expensive , and the printer also became a separate unit to reduce the cost of the printer , amstrad commissioned an asic ( custom circuit ) from mej electronics , which had developed the hardware for amstrad 's earlier cpc-464 two other veterans of the cpc-464 's creation played important roles , with roland perry managing the pcw project and locomotive software producing the locoscript word processing program and other software software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business at the time the cheapest complete systems from apricot computers cost under £2,000 and the cheapest ibm pc system cost £2,400 in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets the pcw redefined the idea of '' best value '' in computers by concentrating on reducing the price , which totally disrupted the personal computer market in the first two years over 700,000 pcws were sold , gaining amstrad 60 % of the uk home computer market , and 20 % of the european personal computer market , second only to ibm 's 33.3 % share in the pcw 's heyday the magazines 8000 plus ( later called pcw plus ) and pcw today were published specifically for pcw users the daily telegraph estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the uk , and said that the reliability of the pcw 's hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity laing says the pcw line 's downfall was that '' proper pcs became affordable '' in 1993 the pcw still cost under £390 while a pc system with a printer and word processing software cost over £1,000 also available at virtuallearning.org.uk users of windows , unix or macos systems who wish to run programs that were developed for the pcw 8256 , 8512 , 9256 , 9512 and 9512+ can use an emulator called '' joyce '' the pcw 8256 was launched in september 1985 , and had 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram and one floppy disk drive launched a few months later , the pcw 8512 had 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram and two floppy disk drives the monitor could also display graphics well enough for the bundled graphics program and for some games the floppy disk drives on these models were in the unusual 3-inch '' compact floppy '' format , which was selected as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives users of single-sided drives had to flip the disks over to use the full capacity the keyboard had 82 keys , some of which were designed for word processing , especially with the bundled locoscript software – for example to cut , copy , and paste the pcw 8256 's ram could be expanded to 512 & nbsp ; kb for a hardware cost of about £50 graphical user interface devices such as light pens , mice and graphic tablets could be attached to the expansion socket at the back of the monitor the partnership between amstrad and schneider had been formed to market the amstrad cpc range of computers , and broke up when amstrad launched the pcw9512 the pcw 9512 , introduced in 1987 at a price of £499 plus vat , had a white-on-black screen instead of green-on-black , and the bundled printer was a daisy-wheel model instead of a dot-matrix printer these models also had a parallel port , allowing non-amstrad printers to be attached the 9512 was also supplied with version 2 of the locoscript word processor program which included spellchecker and mail merge facilities the 9512+ had 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram , and two printer options , the amstrad daisy-wheel unit and a series of considerably more expensive canon inkjet printers : initially the bj10e , later the bj10ex and finally the bj10sx by this time other systems offered much better print quality , and the pcw was a poor choice as a general-purpose computer , because of its slow cpu and incompatibility with ms-dos systems while competitors included hard disk drives with capacities of a few hundred & nbsp ; mb to a few gb , the pcw16 used a 1 & nbsp ; mb flash memory to store the programs and user files on the other hand , the standalone locoscript word processor program was able to use 154 & nbsp ; kb as normal memory , and the rest as a ram disk all pcw models , including the pcw16 , used the zilog z80 range of cpus : z80a at a clock speed of 4 & nbsp ; mhz for the 8256 , 8512 , 9512 , 9256 , 9512+ and pcw10 ; and z80a at 16 & nbsp ; mhz in the pcw16 to make the printer cheap enough to be included with every pcw , amstrad placed the majority of its drive electronics inside the pcw cabinet while the joyce architecture was designed with configurations of 128 & nbsp ; kb and 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram in mind , no pcw was ever sold with 128 & nbsp ; kb of ram

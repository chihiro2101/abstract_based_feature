to reduce the cost of the printer , amstrad commissioned an asic ( custom circuit ) from mej electronics , which had developed the hardware for amstrad 's earlier cpc-464 two other veterans of the cpc-464 's creation played important roles , with roland perry managing the pcw project and locomotive software producing the locoscript word processing program and other software the cp/m operating system was added at the last minute for the launch the product name '' zircon '' was jointly suggested by mej electronics and locomotive software , as both companies had been spun off from data recall , which had produced a word processing system called '' diamond '' in the 1970s sugar reshuffled the initials and the product was launched as the '' personal computer word-processor '' , abbreviated to '' pcw '' in britain the system was initially sold exclusively through dixons , whose chairman shared sugar 's dream that computers would cease to be exclusive products for the technologically adept and would become consumer products in 1986 , john whitehead described the amstrad pcw as '' the bargain of the decade '' , and technology writer gordon laing said in 2007 , '' it represented fantastic value at a time when an ibm pc or a mac would cost a comparative fortune software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business shortly afterwards the tandy 1000 was introduced in the uk with the ms-dos operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other ibm-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in britain at the time the cheapest complete systems from apricot computers cost under £2,000 and the cheapest ibm pc system cost £2,400 in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets the low price encouraged home users to trade up from simpler systems like the sinclair spectrum , whose sales had passed their peak in the first two years over 700,000 pcws were sold , gaining amstrad 60 % of the uk home computer market , and 20 % of the european personal computer market , second only to ibm 's 33.3 % share having gained credibility as computer supplier , amstrad launched ibm-compatible pcs , once again focussing on low prices , with its pc1512 surpassing the ibm pc on performance and beating even the taiwanese clones on price in the pcw 's heyday the magazines 8000 plus ( later called pcw plus ) and pcw today were published specifically for pcw users in 1993 the pcw still cost under £390 while a pc system with a printer and word processing software cost over £1,000 the pcw 8256 was launched in september 1985 , and had 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram and one floppy disk drive launched a few months later , the pcw 8512 had 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram and two floppy disk drives the designers preferred this to the usual personal computer display of 25 80-character lines , as the larger size would be more convenient for displaying a whole letter the floppy disk drives on these models were in the unusual 3-inch '' compact floppy '' format , which was selected as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives while all the 3-inch disks were double-sided , the pcw 256 's 3-inch drive and the pcw 8512 's upper one were single-sided , while the 8512 's lower one was double-sided and double-density hence there were two types of disk : single-density , which could store 180 & nbsp ; kb of data per side , equivalent to about 70 & nbsp ; pages of text each ; and double density , which could store twice as much per side users of single-sided drives had to flip the disks over to use the full capacity however it had only 9 printing pins and even its higher quality did not match that of 24-pin printers alternatively one could add external drives , for example if a 3½-inch drive was needed the pcw 9512 , introduced in 1987 at a price of £499 plus vat , had a white-on-black screen instead of green-on-black , and the bundled printer was a daisy-wheel model instead of a dot-matrix printer in 1991 the 9512 was replaced by the pcw 9256 and 9512+ , both equipped with a single 3½-inch disk drive that could access 720 & nbsp ; kb this could only run one application at a time , and starting another application made the previous one save all the files it had changed and then close this provided a range of facilities comparable to those of ms-dos , but imposed a significant limitation : it could not address more than 64 & nbsp ; kb of ram many software vendors supplied versions of their products to run with cp/m plus , making a wide range of software available for the pcw , often very cheaply : alternative word processors included superwriter and wordstar each pcw 's cp/m application could not use more than 64 & nbsp ; kb so the system used the rest of the ram for a ram drive amstrad pcw & nbsp ; 16 page at www.old-computers.com amstrad pcw 8256/8512 at www.old-computers.com pcw joyce computer club screen shots of the pcw16 's rosanne gui pcw nostalgia

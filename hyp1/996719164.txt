amstrad 's founder alan sugar realised that most computers in the united kingdom were used for word processing at home , and allegedly sketched an outline design for a low cost replacement for typewriters during a flight to the far east to reduce the cost of the printer , amstrad commissioned an asic ( custom circuit ) from mej electronics , which had developed the hardware for amstrad 's earlier cpc-464 two other veterans of the cpc-464 's creation played important roles , with roland perry managing the pcw project and locomotive software producing the locoscript word processing program and other software the cp/m operating system was added at the last minute for the launch the product name '' zircon '' was jointly suggested by mej electronics and locomotive software , as both companies had been spun off from data recall , which had produced a word processing system called '' diamond '' in the 1970s in britain the system was initially sold exclusively through dixons , whose chairman shared sugar 's dream that computers would cease to be exclusive products for the technologically adept and would become consumer products in 1986 , john whitehead described the amstrad pcw as '' the bargain of the decade '' , and technology writer gordon laing said in 2007 , '' it represented fantastic value at a time when an ibm pc or a mac would cost a comparative fortune '' at its united kingdom launch in september 1985 , the basic pcw model was priced at £399 plus value added tax , which included a printer , word processor program , the cp/m operating system and associated utilities , and a basic interpreter software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business shortly afterwards the tandy 1000 was introduced in the uk with the ms-dos operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other ibm-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in britain at the time the cheapest complete systems from apricot computers cost under £2,000 and the cheapest ibm pc system cost £2,400 although competitors ' systems generally had more sophisticated features , including colour monitors , whitehead thought the amstrad pcw offered the best value for money in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets the pcw redefined the idea of '' best value '' in computers by concentrating on reducing the price , which totally disrupted the personal computer market having gained credibility as computer supplier , amstrad launched ibm-compatible pcs , once again focussing on low prices , with its pc1512 surpassing the ibm pc on performance and beating even the taiwanese clones on price in addition to the usual product reviews and technical advice , they featured other content such as articles by science fiction writer and software developer dave langford on his experiences of using the pcw the daily telegraph estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the uk , and said that the reliability of the pcw 's hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity in 1993 the pcw still cost under £390 while a pc system with a printer and word processing software cost over £1,000 however , after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia ibm-compatible pc in 1997 was about 11 % more than that of a pcw 8256 in 1985 , and many home pcs were cast-offs , sometimes costing as little as £50 , from large organisations that had upgraded their systems also available at virtuallearning.org.uk users of windows , unix or macos systems who wish to run programs that were developed for the pcw 8256 , 8512 , 9256 , 9512 and 9512+ can use an emulator called '' joyce '' the pcw 8256 was launched in september 1985 , and had 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram and one floppy disk drive launched a few months later , the pcw 8512 had 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram and two floppy disk drives the floppy disk drives on these models were in the unusual 3-inch '' compact floppy '' format , which was selected as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives hence there were two types of disk : single-density , which could store 180 & nbsp ; kb of data per side , equivalent to about 70 & nbsp ; pages of text each ; and double density , which could store twice as much per side users who needed to support higher print volumes or to produce graphics could buy a daisy wheel printer or plotter from amstrad a wide range of upgrades became available the pcw 8256 's ram could be expanded to 512 & nbsp ; kb for a hardware cost of about £50 the designs were licensed to the german consumer electronics company schneider , which slightly modified their appearance and consequently sold them as '' joyce '' and '' joyce plus '' instead of having two operating environments , locoscript for word processing and cp/m for other uses , it had its own gui operating system , known as '' rosanne '' all pcw models , including the pcw16 , used the zilog z80 range of cpus : z80a at a clock speed of 4 & nbsp ; mhz for the 8256 , 8512 , 9512 , 9256 , 9512+ and pcw10 ; and z80a at 16 & nbsp ; mhz in the pcw16 some of the later models included a built-in parallel port ; these could be bundled with either the dedicated amstrad printer or a canon bubblejet model amstrad cp/m plus character set amstrad cpc symbos list of amstrad pcw games ibm displaywriter system

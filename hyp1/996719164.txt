amstrad 's founder alan sugar realised that most computers in the united kingdom were used for word processing at home , and allegedly sketched an outline design for a low cost replacement for typewriters during a flight to the far east however the portrait display was quickly eliminated because it would have been too expensive , and the printer also became a separate unit to reduce the cost of the printer , amstrad commissioned an asic ( custom circuit ) from mej electronics , which had developed the hardware for amstrad 's earlier cpc-464 the cp/m operating system was added at the last minute for the launch the product name '' zircon '' was jointly suggested by mej electronics and locomotive software , as both companies had been spun off from data recall , which had produced a word processing system called '' diamond '' in the 1970s sugar reshuffled the initials and the product was launched as the '' personal computer word-processor '' , abbreviated to '' pcw '' '' at its united kingdom launch in september 1985 , the basic pcw model was priced at £399 plus value added tax , which included a printer , word processor program , the cp/m operating system and associated utilities , and a basic interpreter software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business shortly afterwards the tandy 1000 was introduced in the uk with the ms-dos operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other ibm-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in britain at the time the cheapest complete systems from apricot computers cost under £2,000 and the cheapest ibm pc system cost £2,400 although competitors ' systems generally had more sophisticated features , including colour monitors , whitehead thought the amstrad pcw offered the best value for money in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets the system was sold in the us via major stores , business equipment shops and electronics retailers in the first two years over 700,000 pcws were sold , gaining amstrad 60 % of the uk home computer market , and 20 % of the european personal computer market , second only to ibm 's 33.3 % share having gained credibility as computer supplier , amstrad launched ibm-compatible pcs , once again focussing on low prices , with its pc1512 surpassing the ibm pc on performance and beating even the taiwanese clones on price amstrad became the dominant british personal computer company , buying all the designs , marketing rights and product stocks of sinclair research ltd 's computer division in april 1986 , while apricot later sold its manufacturing assets to mitsubishi and became a software company in the pcw 's heyday the magazines 8000 plus ( later called pcw plus ) and pcw today were published specifically for pcw users in addition to the usual product reviews and technical advice , they featured other content such as articles by science fiction writer and software developer dave langford on his experiences of using the pcw the daily telegraph estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the uk , and said that the reliability of the pcw 's hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity in 1993 the pcw still cost under £390 while a pc system with a printer and word processing software cost over £1,000 however , after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia ibm-compatible pc in 1997 was about 11 % more than that of a pcw 8256 in 1985 , and many home pcs were cast-offs , sometimes costing as little as £50 , from large organisations that had upgraded their systems the pcw 8256 was launched in september 1985 , and had 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram and one floppy disk drive launched a few months later , the pcw 8512 had 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram and two floppy disk drives both systems consisted of three units : a printer ; a keyboard ; and a monochrome crt monitor whose casing included the processor , memory , motherboard , one or two floppy disk drives , the power supply for all the units and the connectors for the printer and keyboard the floppy disk drives on these models were in the unusual 3-inch '' compact floppy '' format , which was selected as it had a simpler electrical interface than 3½-inch drives the keyboard had 82 keys , some of which were designed for word processing , especially with the bundled locoscript software – for example to cut , copy , and paste the pcw 8256 's ram could be expanded to 512 & nbsp ; kb for a hardware cost of about £50 the partnership between amstrad and schneider had been formed to market the amstrad cpc range of computers , and broke up when amstrad launched the pcw9512 all pcw models , including the pcw16 , used the zilog z80 range of cpus : z80a at a clock speed of 4 & nbsp ; mhz for the 8256 , 8512 , 9512 , 9256 , 9512+ and pcw10 ; and z80a at 16 & nbsp ; mhz in the pcw16 software could work round this by bank switching , accessing different banks of memory at different times but this made programming more complex and slowed the system down each pcw 's cp/m application could not use more than 64 & nbsp ; kb so the system used the rest of the ram for a ram drive amstrad pcw & nbsp ; 16 page at www.old-computers.com amstrad pcw 8256/8512 at www.old-computers.com pcw joyce computer club screen shots of the pcw16 's rosanne gui pcw nostalgia

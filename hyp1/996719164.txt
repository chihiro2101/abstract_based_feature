amstrad 's founder alan sugar realised that most computers in the united kingdom were used for word processing at home , and allegedly sketched an outline design for a low cost replacement for typewriters during a flight to the far east however the portrait display was quickly eliminated because it would have been too expensive , and the printer also became a separate unit two other veterans of the cpc-464 's creation played important roles , with roland perry managing the pcw project and locomotive software producing the locoscript word processing program and other software for the launch the product name '' zircon '' was jointly suggested by mej electronics and locomotive software , as both companies had been spun off from data recall , which had produced a word processing system called '' diamond '' in the 1970s sugar reshuffled the initials and the product was launched as the '' personal computer word-processor '' , abbreviated to '' pcw '' in britain the system was initially sold exclusively through dixons , whose chairman shared sugar 's dream that computers would cease to be exclusive products for the technologically adept and would become consumer products software vendors quickly made a wide range of additional applications available , including accounting , spreadsheet and database programs , so that the system was able to support most of the requirements of a home or small business shortly afterwards the tandy 1000 was introduced in the uk with the ms-dos operating system and a similar suite of business applications and became the only other ibm-compatible personal computer system available for less than £1,000 in britain at the time the cheapest complete systems from apricot computers cost under £2,000 and the cheapest ibm pc system cost £2,400 although competitors ' systems generally had more sophisticated features , including colour monitors , whitehead thought the amstrad pcw offered the best value for money in the us the pcw was launched at a price of 799 , and its competitors were initially the magnavox videowriter and smith corona pwp , two word-processing systems whose prices also included a screen , keyboard and printer the magazine popular science thought that the pcw could not compete as a general-purpose computer , because its use of non-standard 3-inch floppy disk drives and the rather old cp/m operating system would restrict the range of software available from expanding beyond the spreadsheet , typing tutor and cheque book balancing programs already on sale however , the magazine predicted that the pcw 's large screen and easy-to-use word processing software would make it a formidable competitor for dedicated word processors in the home and business markets according to personal computer world , the pcw '' got the technophobes using computers '' having gained credibility as computer supplier , amstrad launched ibm-compatible pcs , once again focussing on low prices , with its pc1512 surpassing the ibm pc on performance and beating even the taiwanese clones on price amstrad became the dominant british personal computer company , buying all the designs , marketing rights and product stocks of sinclair research ltd 's computer division in april 1986 , while apricot later sold its manufacturing assets to mitsubishi and became a software company the daily telegraph estimated in 2000 that 100,000 were still in use in the uk , and said that the reliability of the pcw 's hardware and software and the range of independently produced add-on software for its word processing program were factors in its continued popularity in 1993 the pcw still cost under £390 while a pc system with a printer and word processing software cost over £1,000 however , after adjustment for inflation the retail price of a multimedia ibm-compatible pc in 1997 was about 11 % more than that of a pcw 8256 in 1985 , and many home pcs were cast-offs , sometimes costing as little as £50 , from large organisations that had upgraded their systems there is also another one only for windows called '' cp/m box '' the pcw 8256 was launched in september 1985 , and had 256 & nbsp ; kb of ram and one floppy disk drive both systems consisted of three units : a printer ; a keyboard ; and a monochrome crt monitor whose casing included the processor , memory , motherboard , one or two floppy disk drives , the power supply for all the units and the connectors for the printer and keyboard in the range 's early days supplies of 3-inch floppies occasionally ran out , but by 1988 the pcw 's popularity encouraged suppliers to compete for this market while all the 3-inch disks were double-sided , the pcw 256 's 3-inch drive and the pcw 8512 's upper one were single-sided , while the 8512 's lower one was double-sided and double-density this unit could print 90 & nbsp ; characters per second at draft quality and 20 & nbsp ; characters per second at higher quality , and could also produce graphics this was a pcw 9256 with 512 & nbsp ; kb of ram , a parallel printer port , and locoscript 1.5 instead of locoscript 1 this could only run one application at a time , and starting another application made the previous one save all the files it had changed and then close while competitors included hard disk drives with capacities of a few hundred & nbsp ; mb to a few gb , the pcw16 used a 1 & nbsp ; mb flash memory to store the programs and user files locoscript did not run under the control of a standard operating system but booted directly from a floppy disk programs that were already configured for the pcw covered a broad range of requirements including word processors , databases , graphics , personal accounts , programming languages , games , utilities and a full-featured bulletin board system all pcw models , including the pcw16 , used the zilog z80 range of cpus : z80a at a clock speed of 4 & nbsp ; mhz for the 8256 , 8512 , 9512 , 9256 , 9512+ and pcw10 ; and z80a at 16 & nbsp ; mhz in the pcw16 on the other hand , the standalone locoscript word processor program was reported as using up to 154 & nbsp ; kb as normal memory and the rest as a ram disk amstrad pcw & nbsp ; 16 page at www.old-computers.com amstrad pcw 8256/8512 at www.old-computers.com pcw joyce computer club screen shots of the pcw16 's rosanne gui pcw nostalgia

mxf when used in form of '' operational pattern op1a or opatom '' be used as a '' container '' or '' wrapper '' or '' reference file '' format which supports a number of different streams of coded '' essence '' , encoded in any of a variety of video and audio compression formats , together with a metadata wrapper which describes the material contained within the mxf file mxf has full timecode and metadata support , and is intended as a platform-agnostic stable standard for future professional video and audio applications mxf was developed to carry a subset of the advanced authoring format ( aaf ) data model , under a policy known as the zero divergence directive ( zdd ) additionally , many mxf systems produce split-file a/v ( that is , the video and audio stored in separate files ) , and use a file naming convention which relies on randomly generated filenames to link them not only does this exacerbate the issue of knowing exactly what is in an mxf file without specialized tools , but it breaks the functionality of standard desktop computer techniques which are generally used to manipulate data on a level as fundamental as moving , copying , renaming , and deleting thus , an mxf file received & unwrapped may reveal smpte d10 compliant essence with eight mono aes audio components ; the recipient has no way of knowing whether these components are multiple stereo pairs , 5.1 or serve some other purpose smpte 377m : the mxf file format specification ( the overall master document ) smpte eg41 : mxf engineering guide ( a guide explaining how to use mxf ) smpte eg42 : mxf descriptive metadata ( a guide explaining how to use descriptive metadata in mxf ) smpte 380m : dms1 ( a standard set of descriptive metadata to use with mxf files ) smpte 436m : mxf mappings for vbi lines and ancillary data smpte rp210 : smpte metadata dictionary ( the latest version is available here

joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière when he was twenty-three , however , he received permission to study law at the university of poitiers , no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the cardinal jean du bellay there too he probably met jacques peletier du mans , who had published a translation of the ars poetica of horace , with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by la pléiade is to be found in outline it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry while ronsard and jean-antoine de baïf were most influenced by greek models , du bellay was more especially a latinist , and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise this book ( inspired in part by sperone speroni 's dialogo delle lingue , 1542 ) was the expression of the literary principles of the pléiade as a whole , but although ronsard was the chosen leader , its redaction was entrusted to du bellay the violent attacks made by du bellay on marot and his followers , and on sébillet , did not go unanswered aneau pointed out the obvious inconsistency of inculcating imitation of the ancients and depreciating native poets in a work professing to be a defence of the french language du bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition ( 1550 ) of his sonnet sequence olive , with which he also published two polemical poems , the musagnaeomachie , and an ode addressed to ronsard , contre les envieux fioles du bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into french poetry , but he acclimatized it ; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses in the next year he went to rome as one of the secretaries of cardinal du bellay in 1559 du bellay published at poitiers la nouvelle manière de faire son profit des lettres , a satirical epistle translated from the latin of adrien turnèbe , and with it le poète courtisan , which introduced the formal satire into french poetry in the exercise of these functions joachim quarrelled with eustache du bellay , bishop of paris , who prejudiced his relations with the cardinal , less cordial since the publication of the outspoken regrets de la langue française ( 1905 ) , with biographical and critical introduction by léon séché , who also wrote joachim du bellay -- documents nouveaux et inédits ( 1880 ) , and published in 1903 the first volume of a new edition of the œuvres lettres de joachim du bellay ( 1884 ) , edited by pierre de nolhac walter pater , '' joachim du bellay '' , essay in the renaissance ( 1873 ) pp

joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière when he was twenty-three , however , he received permission to study law at the university of poitiers , no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the cardinal jean du bellay there too he probably met jacques peletier du mans , who had published a translation of the ars poetica of horace , with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by la pléiade is to be found in outline it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry du bellay returned with ronsard to paris to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to jean dorat at the collège de coqueret while ronsard and jean-antoine de baïf were most influenced by greek models , du bellay was more especially a latinist , and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise both du bellay and ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these borrowings , and both repudiated the charge of wishing to latinize their mother tongue du bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition ( 1550 ) of his sonnet sequence olive , with which he also published two polemical poems , the musagnaeomachie , and an ode addressed to ronsard , contre les envieux fioles olive , a collection of sonnets modeled after the poetry of petrarch , ariosto , and contemporary italians published by gabriele giolito de ' ferrari , first appeared in 1549 du bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into french poetry , but he acclimatized it ; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses in 1559 du bellay published at poitiers la nouvelle manière de faire son profit des lettres , a satirical epistle translated from the latin of adrien turnèbe , and with it le poète courtisan , which introduced the formal satire into french poetry sainte-beuve , tableau de la poésie française au xvi siècle ( 1828 ) la défense et illust de la langue française ( 1905 ) , with biographical and critical introduction by léon séché , who also wrote joachim du bellay -- documents nouveaux et inédits ( 1880 ) , and published in 1903 the first volume of a new edition of the œuvres lettres de joachim du bellay ( 1884 ) , edited by pierre de nolhac walter pater , '' joachim du bellay '' , essay in the renaissance ( 1873 ) pp biography , bibliography , analysis university of virginia 's gordon project a 1569 edition of du bellay 's works and background information the first complete translation into english of du bellay 's antiquités de rome since spenser lyrics of the french renaissance : marot , du bellay , ronsard by norman r

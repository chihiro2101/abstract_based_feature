joachim du bellay was born at the castle of la turmelière , not far from liré , near angers , being the son of jean du bellay , lord of gonnor , first cousin of the cardinal jean du bellay and of guillaume du bellay both his parents died while he was still a child , and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother , rené du bellay , who neglected his education , leaving him to run wild at la turmelière at poitiers he came in contact with the humanism marc antoine muret , and with jean salmon macrin ( 1490–1557 ) , a latin poet famous in his day there too he probably met jacques peletier du mans , who had published a translation of the ars poetica of horace , with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by la pléiade is to be found in outline it was probably in 1547 that du bellay met ronsard in an inn on the way to poitiers , an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the french school of renaissance poetry du bellay returned with ronsard to paris to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to jean dorat at the collège de coqueret while ronsard and jean-antoine de baïf were most influenced by greek models , du bellay was more especially a latinist , and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his poetry the famous manifesto of the pléiade , the défense et illustration de la langue française ( defense and illustration of the french language , 1549 ) , was at once a complement and a refutation of sébillet 's treatise this book ( inspired in part by sperone speroni 's dialogo delle lingue , 1542 ) was the expression of the literary principles of the pléiade as a whole , but although ronsard was the chosen leader , its redaction was entrusted to du bellay du bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition ( 1550 ) of his sonnet sequence olive , with which he also published two polemical poems , the musagnaeomachie , and an ode addressed to ronsard , contre les envieux fioles olive , a collection of sonnets modeled after the poetry of petrarch , ariosto , and contemporary italians published by gabriele giolito de ' ferrari , first appeared in 1549 olive has been supposed to be an anagram for the name of a mlle viole , but there is little evidence of real passion in the poems , and they may perhaps be regarded as a petrarchan exercise , especially as , in the second edition , the dedication to his lady is exchanged for one to marguerite de valois , daughter of henry ii in the next year he went to rome as one of the secretaries of cardinal du bellay sonnet iii of the antiquités , '' nouveau venu qui cherches rome en rome , '' has been shown to reflect the direct influence of a latin poem by a renaissance writer named jean or janis vitalis both works were published under the pseudonym of j quintil du troussay , and the courtier-poet was generally supposed to be mellin de saint-gelais , with whom du bellay had always , however , been on friendly terms de la langue française ( 1905 ) , with biographical and critical introduction by léon séché , who also wrote joachim du bellay -- documents nouveaux et inédits ( 1880 ) , and published in 1903 the first volume of a new edition of the œuvres lettres de joachim du bellay ( 1884 ) , edited by pierre de nolhac walter pater , '' joachim du bellay '' , essay in the renaissance ( 1873 ) pp

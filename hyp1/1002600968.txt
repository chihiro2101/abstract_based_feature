the size of hoverflies varies depending on the species some , such as members of the genus baccha , are small , elongated , and slender , while others , such as members of criorhina , are large , hairy , and yellow and black many species are brightly colored , with spots , stripes , and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies tenax , are an example of a species of hoverfly who exhibit batesian mimicry many species also hover around flowers , lending to their common name bee flies of the family bombyliidae often mimic hymenoptera and hover around flowers , as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from syrphidae at first glance predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control this includes one of the most common widespread hoverfly species , syritta pipiens , whose larvae feed on aphids hoverflies are a cosmopolitan family found in most biomes , except extreme deserts , tundra at extremely high latitudes , and antarctica while some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves adults are often found near flowers , their principal food source being nectar and pollen syrphid flies are frequent flower visitors to a wide range of wild plants , as well as agricultural crops , and are often considered the second-most important group of pollinators after wild bees although hoverflies are often considered mainly nonselective pollinators , some hoverflies species are highly selective and carry pollen from one plant species more than 40 species of syrphid flies are found in new zealand in a variety of habitats , including agricultural fields and alpine zones however , syrphid flies are not as effective pollinators of alpine herb species as native solitary bees list of hoverfly species of great britain list of flower flies of new zealand list of the flower flies of north america

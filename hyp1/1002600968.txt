the size of hoverflies varies depending on the species some , such as members of the genus baccha , are small , elongated , and slender , while others , such as members of criorhina , are large , hairy , and yellow and black many species are brightly colored , with spots , stripes , and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies tenax , are an example of a species of hoverfly who exhibit batesian mimicry with a few exceptions , hoverflies are distinguished from other flies by having a spurious vein , located parallel to their fourth longitudinal wing vein many species also hover around flowers , lending to their common name bee flies of the family bombyliidae often mimic hymenoptera and hover around flowers , as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from syrphidae at first glance unlike adults , the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods ; some are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant or animal matter , while others are insectivores , eating aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control this includes one of the most common widespread hoverfly species , syritta pipiens , whose larvae feed on aphids while some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves some species are found in more unusual locations ; for example , members of the genus volucella can be found in bumblebee nests , while members of microdon are myrmecophiles , found in ant or termite nests although hoverflies are often considered mainly nonselective pollinators , some hoverflies species are highly selective and carry pollen from one plant species more than 40 species of syrphid flies are found in new zealand in a variety of habitats , including agricultural fields and alpine zones however , syrphid flies are not as effective pollinators of alpine herb species as native solitary bees the island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects ; sj√∂berg has collected 58 species of butterflies there , and ( in seven years of hunting ) 202 species of hoverflies , including 180 in his garden

the size of hoverflies varies depending on the species many species are brightly colored , with spots , stripes , and bands of yellow or brown covering their bodies due to this coloring , they are often mistaken for wasps or bees ; they exhibit batesian mimicry tenax , are an example of a species of hoverfly who exhibit batesian mimicry with a few exceptions , hoverflies are distinguished from other flies by having a spurious vein , located parallel to their fourth longitudinal wing vein many species also hover around flowers , lending to their common name bee flies of the family bombyliidae often mimic hymenoptera and hover around flowers , as well , rendering some bombyliid species hard to tell apart from syrphidae at first glance unlike adults , the maggots of hoverflies feed on a variety of foods ; some are saprotrophs , eating decaying plant or animal matter , while others are insectivores , eating aphids , thrips , and other plant-sucking insects predatory species are beneficial to farmers and gardeners , as aphids destroy crops , and hoverfly maggots are often used in biological control this includes one of the most common widespread hoverfly species , syritta pipiens , whose larvae feed on aphids hoverflies are a cosmopolitan family found in most biomes , except extreme deserts , tundra at extremely high latitudes , and antarctica while some hoverfly larvae are aquatic and are often found in stagnant water , those of species that prey upon aphids and other plant parasites are usually terrestrial , residing on leaves although hoverflies are often considered mainly nonselective pollinators , some hoverflies species are highly selective and carry pollen from one plant species the orchid species epipactis veratrifolia mimics alarm pheromones of aphids which attracts pollinating hoverflies native flies ( allograpta and platycheirus ) in alpine zones show preferences for flower species based on their colour in alpine zones ; syrphid flies consistently choose yellow flowers over white regardless of species the island is a hotspot for hoverflies and other insects ; sj√∂berg has collected 58 species of butterflies there , and ( in seven years of hunting ) 202 species of hoverflies , including 180 in his garden

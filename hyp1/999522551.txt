inch ( actually 0.15 & nbsp ; inch , 3.81 & nbsp ; mm ) and tape speed was 1.875 & nbsp ; inches ( 4.8 & nbsp ; cm ) per second , giving a decidedly non hi-fi frequency response and quite high noise levels tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s , and a cassette deck with manual level controls and vu meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems eventually the reel-to-reel recorder was completely displaced , in part because of the usage constraints presented by their large size , expense , and the inconvenience of threading and rewinding the tape reels - cassettes are more portable and can be stopped and immediately removed in the middle of playback without rewinding cassettes became extremely popular for automotive and other portable music applications although pre-recorded cassettes were widely available , many users would combine ( dub ) songs from their vinyl records or cassettes to make a new custom mixtape cassette in 1970 , the advent corporation combined dolby b noise reduction system with chromium dioxide ( cro 2 ) tape to create the advent model 200 , the first high-fidelity cassette deck this deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by nakamichi , then soon replaced by the model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by wollensak , a division of 3m , which was commonly used in audio/visual applications the model 200 featured piano key style transport controls , with the model 201 using the distinctive combination of a separate lever for rewind/fast forward and the large play and stop button as found on their commercial reel to reel machines of the era mechanical controls were replaced with electronic push buttons controlling solenoid mechanical actuators , though low cost models would retain mechanical controls a major boost to the cassette 's popularity came with the release of the sony walkman '' personal '' cassette player in 1979 , designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact '' wearable '' music source cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio , and many in professional audio , with each company offering models of very high quality cassette decks from companies such as nakamichi , revox , and tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors the first auto reverse cassette deck came from dual in germany in 1974 as a part of the digital revolution , the ongoing development of electronics moore 's law to the point that the technology could be applied to consumer electronics the inclusion of logic gate and solenoid into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks , often referred to '' logic control , '' contrasts with earlier '' piano-key '' transport controls and mechanical linkages one goal of using logic circuitry in cassette decks or recorders was to error-tolerant design by including fail-safe into the transport and control mechanism some examples of fail-safe mechanisms incorporated into logic control decks include : a mechanism designed to protect internal components from damage when the tape or motor is locked , a mechanism designed to prevent the tape from being wound improperly , among others some logic control decks were designed to incorporate light-touch buttons or remote control , among other features marketed as being convenient in the car stereo industry , full logic control was developed with the aim of miniaturization , so that the cassette deck would take up less dashboard space three-head technology uses separate heads for recording and playback ( the third of the three heads being the erase head ) philips developed an alternative noise reduction system known as dynamic noise limiter ( dnl ) which did not require the tapes to be processed during recording ; this was also the basis of the later dnr noise reduction high-end cassette decks could achieve 15 & nbsp ; hz-22 & nbsp ; khz±3 & nbsp ; db frequency response with wow and flutter below 0.022 % , and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 61 & nbsp ; db ( for type iv tape , without noise-reduction ) in-car cassette players were the first to adopt automatic reverse ( '' auto-reverse '' ) of the tape direction at each end , allowing a cassette to be played endlessly without manual intervention analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape ( dat ) , minidisc , and the cd-r recorder drives early cd playback equipment also tended to be expensive compared to cassette equipment of similar quality and did not offer recording capability some cd recorders , particularly those intended for business use , incorporate a cassette deck to allow both formats for recording meetings , church sermons , and books on tape

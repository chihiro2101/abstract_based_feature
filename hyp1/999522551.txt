db , reducing them ( and the hiss ) on playback this deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by nakamichi , then soon replaced by the model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by wollensak , a division of 3m , which was commonly used in audio/visual applications there was a variety of configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s , which settled on front-loading ( see main picture ) with cassette well on one side , dual vu meters on the other , and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications , home audio systems , and for mobile use in cars , as well as portable recorders like an 8-track cartridge , it was relatively insensitive to vehicle motion , but it had reduced tape flutter , as well as the obvious advantages of smaller physical size and fast forward/rewind capability a major boost to the cassette 's popularity came with the release of the sony walkman '' personal '' cassette player in 1979 , designed specifically as a headphone-only ultra-compact '' wearable '' music source cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio , and many in professional audio , with each company offering models of very high quality cassette decks from companies such as nakamichi , revox , and tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors the application of such digital electronics to cassette decks provides an early example of mechatronic design , which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance , increase system flexibility , or reduce cost some examples of fail-safe mechanisms incorporated into logic control decks include : a mechanism designed to protect internal components from damage when the tape or motor is locked , a mechanism designed to prevent the tape from being wound improperly , among others separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording , permitting immediate verification of the recording quality fonoforum.de 8/1991 , testreport dolby-s-kassettendeck ( german ; pdf , 2 mb ) the dolby noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on slow , narrow , cassette tapes hx pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has a high level of high frequency content some decks incorporated microprocessor programs to adjust tape bias and record level calibration automatically in later years , an '' auto reverse '' feature appeared that allowed the deck to play ( and , in some decks , record ) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove , flip , and re-insert the cassette even in a machine with a four channel head , slight asymmetries in the cassette shell make it difficult to align the head perfectly for both directions later nakamichi auto-reverse models , the rx series , was essentially a single-directional deck , but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport , flipped it over , and re-inserted it a variety of noise reduction and other schemes are used to increase fidelity , with dolby b being almost universal for both prerecorded tapes and home recording the main alternative to dolby was the dbx noise reduction system , which achieved a high signal-to-noise ratio , but was essentially unlistenable when played back on decks that lacked the dbx decoding circuitry cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape ( dat ) , minidisc , and the cd-r recorder drives many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape cassette tapes can also be recorded multiple times ( though some solid-state digital recorders are now offering that function ) vintage cassette decks - a collection of vintage cassette decks of all brands .

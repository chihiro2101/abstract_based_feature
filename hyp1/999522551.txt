the first consumer tape recorder to employ a tape reel permanently housed in a small removable cartridge was the rca tape cartridge , which appeared in 1958 as a predecessor to the cassette format at that time , reel to reel recorders and players were commonly used by enthusiasts , but required large individual reels and tapes which had to be threaded by hand , making them less-accessible to the casual consumer the tape width was 1 ‚ÅÑ 8 & nbsp ; inch ( actually 0.15 & nbsp ; inch , 3.81 & nbsp ; mm ) and tape speed was 1.875 & nbsp ; inches ( 4.8 & nbsp ; cm ) per second , giving a decidedly non hi-fi frequency response and quite high noise levels early recorders were intended for dictation and journalists , and were typically hand-held battery-powered devices with built-in microphones and automatic gain control on recording tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s , and a cassette deck with manual level controls and vu meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems in 1970 , the advent corporation combined dolby b noise reduction system with chromium dioxide ( cro 2 ) tape to create the advent model 200 , the first high-fidelity cassette deck advent cassette decks dolby b uses volume companding of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9 & nbsp ; db , reducing them ( and the hiss ) on playback cro 2 used different bias and equalization settings to reduce the overall noise level and extend the high frequency response most manufacturers adopted a standard top-loading format with piano key controls , dual vu meters , and slider level controls cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications , home audio systems , and for mobile use in cars , as well as portable recorders cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio , and many in professional audio , with each company offering models of very high quality the application of such digital electronics to cassette decks provides an early example of mechatronic design , which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance , increase system flexibility , or reduce cost the inclusion of logic gate and solenoid into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks , often referred to '' logic control , '' contrasts with earlier '' piano-key '' transport controls and mechanical linkages one goal of using logic circuitry in cassette decks or recorders was to error-tolerant design by including fail-safe into the transport and control mechanism '' by the provision of a logical circuit in the control circuit for a magnetic recorder , even when the keys of the key board are actuated in any desired sequence , the magnetic recorder and its associated devices can be promptly and precisely controlled without causing any damages thereon some examples of fail-safe mechanisms incorporated into logic control decks include : a mechanism designed to protect internal components from damage when the tape or motor is locked , a mechanism designed to prevent the tape from being wound improperly , among others some logic control decks were designed to incorporate light-touch buttons or remote control , among other features marketed as being convenient three-head technology uses separate heads for recording and playback ( the third of the three heads being the erase head ) separate record and playback heads also allow off-the-tape monitoring during recording , permitting immediate verification of the recording quality some models squeezed a monitor head into the capstan area , and others combined separate record and playback gaps into a single headshell fonoforum.de 8/1991 , testreport dolby-s-kassettendeck ( german ; pdf , 2 mb ) the dolby noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on slow , narrow , cassette tapes hx pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has a high level of high frequency content some decks incorporated microprocessor programs to adjust tape bias and record level calibration automatically in later years , an '' auto reverse '' feature appeared that allowed the deck to play ( and , in some decks , record ) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove , flip , and re-insert the cassette most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head ( similar to those on multitrack recorders ) , with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time , one pair for each direction most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes ( iec type iv ) which require still higher bias for recording , though they will play back correctly at the ii setting since the equalization is the same and home tape deck users do n't use prerecorded tapes at all cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape many current budget-oriented cassette decks lack a tape selector to set proper bias and equalization settings to take best advantage of the extended high end of type ii high bias and type iv metal bias tapes vintage cassette decks - a collection of vintage cassette decks of all brands .

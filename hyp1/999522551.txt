pdf , 2 mb ) the dolby noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on slow , narrow , cassette tapes it works by boosting the high frequencies on recording , especially low-level high-frequency sounds , with corresponding high frequency reduction on playback this permitted the convenience of auto-reverse with little compromise in record or playback quality chromium dioxide ( referred to as cro 2 or type ii ) was the first tape designed for extended high frequency response , but it required higher bias high-end cassette decks could achieve 15 & nbsp ; hz-22 & nbsp ; khz±3 & nbsp ; db frequency response with wow and flutter below 0.022 % , and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 61 & nbsp ; db ( for type iv tape , without noise-reduction ) whereas dolby b was already in widespread use in the 1970s , prerecorded cassettes were duplicated onto rather poor quality tape stock at ( often ) high speed and did not compare in fidelity to high-grade lps cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape audio asylum tape trail – a discussion forum of interest to those involved in cassette technology

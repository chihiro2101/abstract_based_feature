inch ( actually 0.15 & nbsp ; inch , 3.81 & nbsp ; mm ) and tape speed was 1.875 & nbsp ; inches ( 4.8 & nbsp ; cm ) per second , giving a decidedly non hi-fi frequency response and quite high noise levels tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s , and a cassette deck with manual level controls and vu meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems eventually the reel-to-reel recorder was completely displaced , in part because of the usage constraints presented by their large size , expense , and the inconvenience of threading and rewinding the tape reels - cassettes are more portable and can be stopped and immediately removed in the middle of playback without rewinding in 1970 , the advent corporation combined dolby b noise reduction system with chromium dioxide ( cro 2 ) tape to create the advent model 200 , the first high-fidelity cassette deck advent cassette decks dolby b uses volume companding of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9 & nbsp ; db , reducing them ( and the hiss ) on playback this deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by nakamichi , then soon replaced by the model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by wollensak , a division of 3m , which was commonly used in audio/visual applications like an 8-track cartridge , it was relatively insensitive to vehicle motion , but it had reduced tape flutter , as well as the obvious advantages of smaller physical size and fast forward/rewind capability cassette decks reached their pinnacle of performance and complexity by the mid-1980s cassette decks from companies such as nakamichi , revox , and tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors the application of such digital electronics to cassette decks provides an early example of mechatronic design , which aims to enhance mechanical systems with electronic components in order to improve performance , increase system flexibility , or reduce cost one goal of using logic circuitry in cassette decks or recorders was to error-tolerant design by including fail-safe into the transport and control mechanism some logic control decks were designed to incorporate light-touch buttons or remote control , among other features marketed as being convenient in the car stereo industry , full logic control was developed with the aim of miniaturization , so that the cassette deck would take up less dashboard space fonoforum.de 8/1991 , testreport dolby-s-kassettendeck ( german ; pdf , 2 mb ) the dolby noise reduction system was key to realizing low noise performance on slow , narrow , cassette tapes it works by boosting the high frequencies on recording , especially low-level high-frequency sounds , with corresponding high frequency reduction on playback hx pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has a high level of high frequency content some decks incorporated microprocessor programs to adjust tape bias and record level calibration automatically most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head ( similar to those on multitrack recorders ) , with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time , one pair for each direction a variety of noise reduction and other schemes are used to increase fidelity , with dolby b being almost universal for both prerecorded tapes and home recording dolby b was designed to address the high-frequency noise inherent in cassette tapes , and along with improvements in tape formulation it helped the cassette win acceptances as a high-fidelity medium at the same time , dolby b provided acceptable performance when played back on decks that lacked dolby circuitry , meaning there was little reason not to use it if it was available almost all cassette decks have an mpx filter to improve the sound quality and the tracking of the noise reduction system when recording from a fm stereo broadcast cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape the rise of inexpensive all-solid-state portable digital music systems based on mp3 , aac and similar formats finally saw the eventual decline of the domestic cassette deck today , cassette decks are not considered by most people to be either the most versatile or highest fidelity sound recording devices available , as even very inexpensive cd or digital audio players can reproduce a wide frequency range with no speed variations many current budget-oriented cassette decks lack a tape selector to set proper bias and equalization settings to take best advantage of the extended high end of type ii high bias and type iv metal bias tapes

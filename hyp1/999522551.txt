inch ( actually 0.15 & nbsp ; inch , 3.81 & nbsp ; mm ) and tape speed was 1.875 & nbsp ; inches ( 4.8 & nbsp ; cm ) per second , giving a decidedly non hi-fi frequency response and quite high noise levels early recorders were intended for dictation and journalists , and were typically hand-held battery-powered devices with built-in microphones and automatic gain control on recording tape recorder audio-quality had improved by the mid-1970s , and a cassette deck with manual level controls and vu meters became a standard component of home high-fidelity systems although pre-recorded cassettes were widely available , many users would combine ( dub ) songs from their vinyl records or cassettes to make a new custom mixtape cassette in 1970 , the advent corporation combined dolby b noise reduction system with chromium dioxide ( cro 2 ) tape to create the advent model 200 , the first high-fidelity cassette deck advent cassette decks dolby b uses volume companding of high frequencies to boost low-level treble information by up to 9 & nbsp ; db , reducing them ( and the hiss ) on playback this deck was based on a top-loading mechanism by nakamichi , then soon replaced by the model 201 based on a more reliable transport made by wollensak , a division of 3m , which was commonly used in audio/visual applications there was a variety of configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s , which settled on front-loading ( see main picture ) with cassette well on one side , dual vu meters on the other , and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle cassette decks soon came into widespread use and were designed variously for professional applications , home audio systems , and for mobile use in cars , as well as portable recorders from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the cassette deck was the preferred music source for the automobile cassette decks were eventually manufactured by almost every well known brand in home audio , and many in professional audio , with each company offering models of very high quality cassette decks from companies such as nakamichi , revox , and tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors the first auto reverse cassette deck came from dual in germany in 1974 the inclusion of logic gate and solenoid into the transport and control mechanisms of cassette decks , often referred to '' logic control , '' contrasts with earlier '' piano-key '' transport controls and mechanical linkages some examples of fail-safe mechanisms incorporated into logic control decks include : a mechanism designed to protect internal components from damage when the tape or motor is locked , a mechanism designed to prevent the tape from being wound improperly , among others a narrower head gap is optimal for playback than for recording , so the head gap width of any combined record/playback head must necessarily be a compromise ) three-head systems were common on reel-to-reel decks , but were more difficult to implement for cassettes , which do not provide separate openings for record and play heads hx pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has a high level of high frequency content reducing the level of the bias signal permits the desired signal to be recorded at a higher level without saturating the tape , thus increasing '' headroom '' or maximum recording level some decks incorporated microprocessor programs to adjust tape bias and record level calibration automatically in later years , an '' auto reverse '' feature appeared that allowed the deck to play ( and , in some decks , record ) on both sides of the cassette without the operator having to manually remove , flip , and re-insert the cassette most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head ( similar to those on multitrack recorders ) , with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time , one pair for each direction with an estimated 15 % of the chain 's total tape business now generated by the sales of blanks , '' it would appear our added tape sales are going to tdk , maxell and sony , not you almost all cassette decks have an mpx filter to improve the sound quality and the tracking of the noise reduction system when recording from a fm stereo broadcast cassette equipment needs regular maintenance , as cassette tape is a magnetic medium which is in physical contact with the tape head and other metallic parts of the recorder/player mechanism analog cassette deck sales were expected to decline rapidly with the advent of the compact disc and other digital recording technologies such as digital audio tape ( dat ) , minidisc , and the cd-r recorder drives many home and portable entertainment systems supported both formats and commonly allowed the cd playback to be recorded on cassette tape audio asylum tape trail – a discussion forum of interest to those involved in cassette technology

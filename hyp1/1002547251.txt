helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color even when told of their successes , they would not begin to spontaneously make '' guesses '' about objects , but instead still required prompting furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia the modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the '' hidden perception '' experienced in blindsight patients another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain a third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex the stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field a study reported in 2008 asked patient gy to misstate where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual the same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields they wanted to see if their subject—who exhibited blindsight in other studies —could react more quickly when his/her attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it the route from the retina through v1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex , though it is by far the largest ; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass v1 people with damage to v1 report no conscious vision , no visual imagery , and no visual images in their dreams most axons from the lgn will then travel to the primary visual cortex in a study conducted in primates , after partial ablation of area v1 , areas v2 and v3 were still excited by visual stimulus

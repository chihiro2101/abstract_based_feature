one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight the first states that after damage to area v1 , other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus and several other areas , including parts of the cerebral cortex another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception ( 2004 ) processes in biological vision section 7.4 evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months , although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field by comparing the test results of both gy and the monkeys , the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the '' blind '' visual field can be found in both species lawrence weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field , some observers do better than chance this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field the normal techniques that were used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects the results of db 's guesses showed that db was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level , despite not being visually aware of this the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual alexander and cowey investigated how contrasting brightness of stimuli affects blindsight patients ' ability to discern movement both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously to test the effect of brightness on the subject 's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots tn was not aware at the time , but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation the route from the retina through v1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex , though it is by far the largest ; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass v1 their findings concluded that there was an indeed a connection of visual motion information that went directly from the lgn to the hmt+ bypassing v1 completely

one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color even when told of their successes , they would not begin to spontaneously make '' guesses '' about objects , but instead still required prompting patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia the modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the '' hidden perception '' experienced in blindsight patients another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception in a 1995 experiment , researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also experienced blindsight the monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field in the monkeys , the striate cortex of the left hemisphere was surgically removed by comparing the test results of both gy and the monkeys , the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the '' blind '' visual field can be found in both species electrophysiological evidence from the late 1970s has shown that there is no direct retinal input from s-cones to the superior colliculus , implying that the perception of color information should be impaired similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field a study reported in 2008 asked patient gy to misstate where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented the discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information , even unconscious information , may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information the same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex if an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged , it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect , functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact kentridge , heywood , and weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness the participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target , even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation the route from the retina through v1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex , though it is by far the largest ; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass v1 injury to the primary visual cortex , including lesions and other trauma , leads to the loss of visual experience evidence also suggests that , following a traumatic injury to v1 , there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the lgn to the extrastriate visual areas

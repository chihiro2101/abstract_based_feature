one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness even when told of their successes , they would not begin to spontaneously make '' guesses '' about objects , but instead still required prompting patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation this ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggests that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain , but is produced by specialised parts of it blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia the first states that after damage to area v1 , other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus and several other areas , including parts of the cerebral cortex another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field this showed that the monkey 's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field , and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder lawrence weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field , some observers do better than chance this ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus ( for example , whether an ' x ' or ' o ' has been presented in the blind field ) however , more recent evidence point to a pathway from s-cones to the superior colliculus , opposing previous research and supporting the idea that some chromatic processing mechanisms are intact in blindsight patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field if the stimulus was in the upper part of his visual field , he was to say it was in the lower part , and vice versa he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual if an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged , it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect , functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields the subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously to test the effect of brightness on the subject 's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots people with damage to v1 report no conscious vision , no visual imagery , and no visual images in their dreams the superior colliculus and prefrontal cortex also have a major role in awareness of a visual stimulus

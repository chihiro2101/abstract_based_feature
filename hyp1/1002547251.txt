one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements hence , visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept this suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a '' binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept '' , which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders , sharp onset/offset times , motion , and low spatial frequency contribute to , but are not strictly necessary for , an object 's salience in blindsight another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception a third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus before the information is projected to the visual cortex to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field the monkeys performed identically to humans on the test , getting them right almost every time this showed that the monkey 's ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field , and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field by comparing the test results of both gy and the monkeys , the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the '' blind '' visual field can be found in both species a 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area v1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field , even though she could not report the sizes of the objects similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field a study reported in 2008 asked patient gy to misstate where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented researchers applied the same type of tests that were used to study blindsight in animals to a patient referred to as db the results of db 's guesses showed that db was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level , despite not being visually aware of this previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field , shape , orientation and movement but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual the same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex alexander and cowey investigated how contrasting brightness of stimuli affects blindsight patients ' ability to discern movement prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields to test the effect of brightness on the subject 's ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots when the contrast in brightness between the background and the dots was higher , both of the subjects could discern motion more accurately than they would have statistically by just guessing the participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target , even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field this information moves through an area of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus , located in the thalamus , and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex , area v1 ( also known as the striate cortex because of its striped appearance ) in a study conducted in primates , after partial ablation of area v1 , areas v2 and v3 were still excited by visual stimulus

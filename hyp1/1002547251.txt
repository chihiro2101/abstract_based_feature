much of our current understanding of blindsight can be attributed to early experiments on monkeys one monkey named helen could be considered the '' star monkey in visual research '' because she was the original blindsight subject helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated ; specifically , her primary visual cortex ( v1 ) was completely removed , blinding her furthermore , under certain experimental conditions , she could detect a variety of visual stimuli , such as the presence and location of objects , as well as shape , pattern , orientation , motion , and color in spite of this , when they were prompted they could '' guess '' with above-average accuracy about the presence and details of objects , much like the animal subjects , and they could even catch objects that were tossed at them furthermore , blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception ( the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes ) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements the phenomenon shows how , after the more complex perception system is damaged , people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they can not see what they are reaching for blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features , such as edges and motion , but can not gain a holistic visual percept the first states that after damage to area v1 , other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus and several other areas , including parts of the cerebral cortex another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person 's visual cortex may be damaged , tiny islands of functioning tissue remain these islands are n't large enough to provide conscious perception , but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception the stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there to do this , researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field starting from the center of the deficit visual field , the object would either move up , down , or to the right several years later , another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight , gy gy 's striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight , though for the most part he retained full functionality , gy was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field similarly , another patient with unilateral lesion of area v1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field he was able to misstate , as requested , in his left visual field ( with normal conscious vision ) ; but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight ( right ) visual field but , in a newer study evidence showed that if the damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged blindsight is a phenomenon that shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information so even when damage occurs in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information , other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual if an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged , it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect , functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields the subjects of the study were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field both of the subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously the study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object tn was not aware at the time , but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation visual information then enters the optic tract and travels to four different areas of the brain including the superior colliculus , pretectum of the mid brain , the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus , and the lateral geniculate nucleus ( lgn ) evidence also suggests that , following a traumatic injury to v1 , there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the lgn to the extrastriate visual areas

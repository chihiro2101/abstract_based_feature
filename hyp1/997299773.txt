the british agricultural revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social , economic and farming technological changes major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow sturgess , '' the agricultural revolution on the english clays '' agricultural history review ( 1966 ) : 104-121 in jstoir the dutch improved the chinese plough so that it could be pulled with fewer oxen or horses one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants besides , other people 's livestock could graze the turnips oats , rye , wheat , and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans , and the third field fallow over the following two centuries , the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands the planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field due to the ability of the bacteria on legume roots to fix nitrogen ( n 2 ) from the air into the soil in a form that plants could use other crops that were occasionally grown were flax and members of the mustard family because nitrogen builds up slowly over time in pasture , ploughing up pasture and planting grains resulted in high yields for a few years fallow land was about 20 % of the arable area in england in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown in the 1830s guano and nitrates from south america were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4 % in 1900 the clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years the addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter , which in turn produced more milk , cheese , meat and manure , which maintained soil fertility the dutch acquired the iron-tipped , curved mouldboard , adjustable depth plough from the chinese in the early 17th century it had the advantage of being able to be pulled by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern european plough the dutch plough was brought to britain by dutch contractors who were hired to drain east anglian fens and somerset moors the plough was extremely successful on wet , boggy soil , but was soon used on ordinary land its fittings and coulter were made of iron and the mouldboard and share were covered with an iron plate , making it easier to pull and more controllable than previous ploughs the plough was easy for a blacksmith to make , but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries they typically worked under the auspices of the aristocracy or the catholic church , who owned much of the land as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields the black death from 1348 onward accelerated the break-up of the feudal system in england many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries the process of enclosing property accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries the more productive enclosed farms meant that fewer farmers were needed to work the same land , leaving many villagers without land and grazing rights some practices of enclosure were denounced by the church , and legislation was drawn up against it ; but the large , enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries the most important development between the 16th century and the mid-19th century was the development of private marketing by the 19th century , marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family eventually , the market evolved into a national one driven by london and other growing cities legislation regulating middlemen required registration , addressed weights and measures , fixing of prices and collection of tolls by the government as more and more farmers followed his lead , farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality walton , '' the diffusion of the improved shorthorn breed of cattle in britain during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in jstor though other contemporary indicators suggest an increase of around a quarter over the intervening century the technology to manufacture affordable and reliable machinery , including agricultural machinery , improved dramatically in the last half of the nineteenth century '' too much revolution : agriculture in the industrial revolution , 1700–1860 '' the agricultural revolution : changes in agriculture , 1650–1880

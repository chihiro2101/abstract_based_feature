the british agricultural revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social , economic and farming technological changes major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow sturgess , '' the agricultural revolution on the english clays '' agricultural history review ( 1966 ) : 104-121 in jstoir the dutch improved the chinese plough so that it could be pulled with fewer oxen or horses one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants planting cover crops such as turnips and clover was not permitted under the common land because they interfered with access to the fields later they employed a three-year , three field crop rotation routine , with a different crop in each of two fields , e.g oats , rye , wheat , and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans , and the third field fallow the significance of convertible husbandry is that it introduced pasture into the rotation the four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the plant nutrition removed with the crops turnips first show up in the probate records in england as early as 1638 but were not widely used till about 1750 fallow land was about 20 % of the arable area in england in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown in the 1830s guano and nitrates from south america were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4 % in 1900 there was no need to let the soil lie fallow as clover would re-add nitrates ( nitrogen-containing salts ) back to the soil the clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years the addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter , which in turn produced more milk , cheese , meat and manure , which maintained soil fertility this maintains a good amount of crops produced the dutch acquired the iron-tipped , curved mouldboard , adjustable depth plough from the chinese in the early 17th century it had the advantage of being able to be pulled by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern european plough as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields many farms were bought by yeomen who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land more secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields other husbandmen rented property they '' share cropped '' with the land owners many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries the process of enclosing property accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries the more productive enclosed farms meant that fewer farmers were needed to work the same land , leaving many villagers without land and grazing rights english poor laws were enacted to help these newly poor some practices of enclosure were denounced by the church , and legislation was drawn up against it ; but the large , enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries this controversy led to a series of government acts , culminating in the enclosure act of 1801 which sanctioned large-scale land reform the lack of internal tariffs , customs barriers and feudal tolls made britain '' the largest coherent market in europe '' a horse could pull at most one ton of freight on a macadam road , which was multi-layer stone covered and crowned , with side drainage railroads would eventually reduce the cost of land transport by over 95 % ; however they did not become important until after 1850 land conversion , drainage and reclamation water-meadows were utilised in the late 16th to the 20th centuries and allowed earlier pasturing of livestock after they were wintered on hay by 1900 half the meat eaten in britain came from abroad and tropical fruits such as bananas were also being imported on the new refrigerator ships 'walter blith ' in oxford dictionary of national biography online edn , jan 2008 and the overall agricultural productivity of britain started to grow significantly only in the period of the agricultural revolution the agricultural revolution in britain proved to be a major turning point in history , allowing the population to far exceed earlier peaks and sustain the country 's rise to industrial pre-eminence the agricultural revolution : changes in agriculture , 1650â€“1880

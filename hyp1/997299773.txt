the british agricultural revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social , economic and farming technological changes sturgess , '' the agricultural revolution on the english clays in jstoir the dutch improved the chinese plough so that it could be pulled with fewer oxen or horses one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants the norfolk system , as it is now known , rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow planting cover crops such as turnips and clover was not permitted under the common land because they interfered with access to the fields later they employed a three-year , three field crop rotation routine , with a different crop in each of two fields , e.g normally from 10 % to 30 % of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year convertible husbandry was the alternation of a field between pasture and grain because nitrogen builds up slowly over time in pasture , ploughing up pasture and planting grains resulted in high yields for a few years the four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the plant nutrition removed with the crops ideally , wheat , barley , turnips and clover would be planted in that order in each field in successive years there was no need to let the soil lie fallow as clover would re-add nitrates ( nitrogen-containing salts ) back to the soil the clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years the dutch acquired the iron-tipped , curved mouldboard , adjustable depth plough from the chinese in the early 17th century the plough was extremely successful on wet , boggy soil , but was soon used on ordinary land by the 1760s foljambe was making large numbers of these ploughs in a factory outside of rotherham , england , using standard patterns with interchangeable parts the plough was easy for a blacksmith to make , but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries it spread to scotland , america , and france they typically worked under the auspices of the aristocracy or the catholic church , who owned much of the land as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields many farms were bought by yeomen who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land more secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields other husbandmen rented property they '' share cropped '' with the land owners many of them moved to the cities in search of work in the emerging factories of the industrial revolution the most important development between the 16th century and the mid-19th century was the development of private marketing by 1700 , there was a national market for wheat legislation regulating middlemen required registration , addressed weights and measures , fixing of prices and collection of tolls by the government the lack of internal tariffs , customs barriers and feudal tolls made britain '' the largest coherent market in europe '' water transport was , and in some cases still is , much more efficient than land transport a horse could pull at most one ton of freight on a macadam road , which was multi-layer stone covered and crowned , with side drainage railroads would eventually reduce the cost of land transport by over 95 % ; however they did not become important until after 1850 another way to get more land was to convert some pasture land into arable land and recover fen land and some pastures it is estimated that the amount of arable land in britain grew by 10–30 % through these land conversions hundreds of thousands died in the famine and millions more emigrated to england , wales , scotland , canada , australia , europe , and the united states , reducing the population from about 8.5 & nbsp ; million in 1845 to 4.3 & nbsp ; million by 1921 the technology to manufacture affordable and reliable machinery , including agricultural machinery , improved dramatically in the last half of the nineteenth century the agricultural revolution : changes in agriculture , 1650–1880 '' agricultural revolution in england 1500–1850 '' —bbc history

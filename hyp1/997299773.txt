the british agricultural revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social , economic and farming technological changes major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow sturgess , '' the agricultural revolution on the english clays '' agricultural history review ( 1966 ) : 104-121 in jstoir the dutch improved the chinese plough so that it could be pulled with fewer oxen or horses one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants an important feature of the norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels during the middle ages , the open field system had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients later they employed a three-year , three field crop rotation routine , with a different crop in each of two fields , e.g oats , rye , wheat , and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans , and the third field fallow normally from 10 % to 30 % of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow over the following two centuries , the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands because nitrogen builds up slowly over time in pasture , ploughing up pasture and planting grains resulted in high yields for a few years the four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the plant nutrition removed with the crops fallow land was about 20 % of the arable area in england in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown in the 1830s the dutch acquired the iron-tipped , curved mouldboard , adjustable depth plough from the chinese in the early 17th century it had the advantage of being able to be pulled by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern european plough the dutch plough was brought to britain by dutch contractors who were hired to drain east anglian fens and somerset moors the plough was extremely successful on wet , boggy soil , but was soon used on ordinary land british improvements included joseph foljambe 's cast iron plough ( patented 1730 ) , which combined an earlier dutch design with a number of innovations the plough was easy for a blacksmith to make , but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries in the traditional open field system , many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce they typically worked under the auspices of the aristocracy or the catholic church , who owned much of the land as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries the most important development between the 16th century and the mid-19th century was the development of private marketing by the 19th century , marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family the next stage of development was trading between markets , requiring merchants , credit and forward sales , knowledge of markets and pricing and of supply and demand in different markets by 1700 , there was a national market for wheat market regulations were eased in 1663 when people were allowed some self-regulation to hold inventory , but it was forbidden to withhold commodities from the market in an effort to increase prices the lack of internal tariffs , customs barriers and feudal tolls made britain '' the largest coherent market in europe '' water transport was , and in some cases still is , much more efficient than land transport in the early 19th century it cost as much to transport a ton of freight 32 miles by wagon over an unimproved road as it did to ship it 3000 miles across the atlantic a horse could pull at most one ton of freight on a macadam road , which was multi-layer stone covered and crowned , with side drainage higher yield per acre crops were also planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900 farmers

the british agricultural revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social , economic and farming technological changes major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow sturgess , '' the agricultural revolution on the english clays one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants the norfolk system , as it is now known , rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow an important feature of the norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels planting cover crops such as turnips and clover was not permitted under the common land because they interfered with access to the fields during the middle ages , the open field system had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients later they employed a three-year , three field crop rotation routine , with a different crop in each of two fields , e.g normally from 10 % to 30 % of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow over the following two centuries , the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands a big disadvantage of convertible husbandry was the hard work in breaking up pastures and difficulty in establishing them the farmers in flanders ( in parts of france and current day belgium ) discovered a still more effective four-field crop rotation system , using turnips and clover ( a legume ) as forage crops to replace the three-year crop rotation fallow year the four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the plant nutrition removed with the crops guano and nitrates from south america were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4 % in 1900 ideally , wheat , barley , turnips and clover would be planted in that order in each field in successive years the turnips helped keep the weeds down and were an excellent forage crop—ruminant animals could eat their tops and roots through a large part of the summer and winters there was no need to let the soil lie fallow as clover would re-add nitrates ( nitrogen-containing salts ) back to the soil the clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years the addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter , which in turn produced more milk , cheese , meat and manure , which maintained soil fertility by the 1760s foljambe was making large numbers of these ploughs in a factory outside of rotherham , england , using standard patterns with interchangeable parts in the traditional open field system , many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce they typically worked under the auspices of the aristocracy or the catholic church , who owned much of the land as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields the black death from 1348 onward accelerated the break-up of the feudal system in england more secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields the process of enclosing property accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries many of them moved to the cities in search of work in the emerging factories of the industrial revolution some practices of enclosure were denounced by the church , and legislation was drawn up against it ; but the large , enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries by the 19th century , marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family the 16th-century market radius was about 10 miles , which could support a town of 10,000 the lack of internal tariffs , customs barriers and feudal tolls made britain '' the largest coherent market in europe '' in the early 19th century it cost as much to transport a ton of freight 32 miles by wagon over an unimproved road as it did to ship it 3000 miles across the atlantic another way to get more land was to convert some pasture land into arable land and recover fen land and some pastures the british agricultural revolution was aided by land maintenance advancements in flanders and the netherlands water-meadows were utilised in the late 16th to the 20th centuries and allowed earlier pasturing of livestock after they were wintered on hay with more capital invested , more organic and inorganic fertilisers , and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5 % /year—not enough to keep up with population growth '' too much revolution : agriculture in the industrial revolution , 1700–1860 '' the agricultural revolution : changes in agriculture , 1650–1880

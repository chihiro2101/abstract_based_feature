the british agricultural revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social , economic and farming technological changes major developments and innovations include : norfolk four-course crop rotation : fodder crops , particularly turnips and clover , replaced leaving the land fallow sturgess , '' the agricultural revolution on the english clays '' agricultural history review ( 1966 ) : 104-121 one of the most important innovations of the british agricultural revolution was the development of the norfolk four-course rotation , which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants turnip roots , for example , can recover nutrients from deep under the soil the norfolk system , as it is now known , rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow an important feature of the norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels besides , other people 's livestock could graze the turnips later they employed a three-year , three field crop rotation routine , with a different crop in each of two fields , e.g normally from 10 % to 30 % of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year over the following two centuries , the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands a big disadvantage of convertible husbandry was the hard work in breaking up pastures and difficulty in establishing them fallow land was about 20 % of the arable area in england in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown in the 1830s guano and nitrates from south america were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4 % in 1900 ideally , wheat , barley , turnips and clover would be planted in that order in each field in successive years the clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as green manure when it was ploughed under after one or two years the addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter , which in turn produced more milk , cheese , meat and manure , which maintained soil fertility the dutch acquired the iron-tipped , curved mouldboard , adjustable depth plough from the chinese in the early 17th century the dutch plough was brought to britain by dutch contractors who were hired to drain east anglian fens and somerset moors the plough was extremely successful on wet , boggy soil , but was soon used on ordinary land by the 1760s foljambe was making large numbers of these ploughs in a factory outside of rotherham , england , using standard patterns with interchangeable parts the plough was easy for a blacksmith to make , but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries in europe , agriculture was feudal from the middle ages in the traditional open field system , many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce as early as the 12th century , some fields in england tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields many farms were bought by yeomen who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of parliament in the 16th and 17th centuries many of them moved to the cities in search of work in the emerging factories of the industrial revolution some practices of enclosure were denounced by the church , and legislation was drawn up against it ; but the large , enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries by the 19th century , marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family eventually , the market evolved into a national one driven by london and other growing cities market regulations were eased in 1663 when people were allowed some self-regulation to hold inventory , but it was forbidden to withhold commodities from the market in an effort to increase prices significant imports of potash obtained from the ashes of trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported in the british industrial revolution : an economic perspective ( 2nd ed “ the agricultural labour market in england , 1793-1872 '' the 'agricultural revolution ' in english history : a reconsideration '' '' agricultural revolution in england 1500–1850 '' —bbc history

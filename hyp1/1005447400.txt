in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery general anaesthesia is induced , with endotracheal tube and full muscle relaxant , and the patient is positioned supine the abdomen is prepared and draped and is examined under anesthesia as the two run at right angles to each other , this reduces the risk of later incisional hernia the standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports also , a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) , using a special multiport umbilical trocar the equipment used for sils is familiar to surgeons already doing laparoscopic surgery if appendicitis develops in a pregnant woman , an appendectomy is usually performed and should not harm the fetus schwartz book of general surgery the risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5 % the risk of fetal death is 20 % in perforated appendicitis some take up to three weeks before being completely active ; for others , it can be a matter of days one of the most common post-operative complications associated with an appendectomy is the development of a surgical site infection ( ssi ) harry hancock performed the first abdominal surgery for appendicitis in 1848 , but he did not remove the appendix on september 13 , 1980 , kurt semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery

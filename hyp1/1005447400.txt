in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery general anaesthesia is induced , with endotracheal tube and full muscle relaxant , and the patient is positioned supine otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix in order to preserve the integrity of abdominal wall , the external oblique aponeurosis is split along the line of its fibers , as is the internal oblique muscle some surgeons choose to bury the stump of the appendix by inverting it so it points into the caecum the standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation described moving laparoscopic incisions to hide them in the natural camouflages like the suprapubic hairline to improve cosmesis have described variants of an sling-based single-port laparoscopic appendectomy with good clinical results also , a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) , using a special multiport umbilical trocar with sils , a more conventional view of the field of surgery is seen compared to notes appendicitis is the most common emergent general surgery related problem to arise during pregnancy if appendicitis develops in a pregnant woman , an appendectomy is usually performed and should not harm the fetus one of the most common post-operative complications associated with an appendectomy is the development of a surgical site infection ( ssi ) harry hancock performed the first abdominal surgery for appendicitis in 1848 , but he did not remove the appendix while appendectomy is a standard surgical procedure , its cost has been found to vary considerably in the united states

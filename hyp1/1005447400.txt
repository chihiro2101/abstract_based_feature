in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery general anaesthesia is induced , with endotracheal tube and full muscle relaxant , and the patient is positioned supine otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix in order to preserve the integrity of abdominal wall , the external oblique aponeurosis is split along the line of its fibers , as is the internal oblique muscle the standardization of an incision is not best practice when performing an appendectomy given that the appendix is a mobile organ a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports additionally , reports in the literature indicate that minilaparoscopic appendectomy using 2â€“ or 3-mm or even smaller instruments along with one 12-mm port minimizes pain and improves cosmesis have described variants of an sling-based single-port laparoscopic appendectomy with good clinical results appendicitis is the most common emergent general surgery related problem to arise during pregnancy these findings , in addition to non-specific abdominal symptoms make appendicitis difficult to diagnose if appendicitis develops in a pregnant woman , an appendectomy is usually performed and should not harm the fetus schwartz book of general surgery the risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5 % overall , there is no increased risk of fetal loss or preterm delivery with the laparoscopic approach ( la ) as compared to the open approach ( oa ) harry hancock performed the first abdominal surgery for appendicitis in 1848 , but he did not remove the appendix while appendectomy is a standard surgical procedure , its cost has been found to vary considerably in the united states

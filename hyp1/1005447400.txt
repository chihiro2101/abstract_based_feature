in general terms , the procedure for an open appendectomy is : antibiotics are given immediately if signs of actual sepsis are seen ( in appendicitis , sepsis and bacteremia usually only occurs at some point after rupture , once peritonitis has begun ) , or if there is reasonable suspicion that the appendix has ruptured ( e.g , on imaging ) or if the onset of peritonitis- which will lead to full sepsis if not quickly treated- is suspected ; otherwise , a single dose of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics is given immediately before surgery general anaesthesia is induced , with endotracheal tube and full muscle relaxant , and the patient is positioned supine otherwise , the incision is made over mcburney 's point ( one-third of the way from the anterior superior iliac spine to the navel ) , which represents the most common position of the base of the appendix the skin may be closed with staples or stitches a physical exam should be performed prior to the operation and the incision should be chosen based on the point of maximal tenderness to palpation many surgeons have attempted to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes in laparoscopic appendectomy by using fewer and smaller ports also , a trend is increasing towards single-incision laparoscopic surgery ( sils ) , using a special multiport umbilical trocar most importantly , it is easy to convert sils to conventional laparoscopy by adding a few trocars ; this conversion to conventional laparoscopy is called 'port rescue ' these findings , in addition to non-specific abdominal symptoms make appendicitis difficult to diagnose schwartz book of general surgery the risk of fetal death in the perioperative period after an appendectomy for early acute appendicitis is 3 to 5 % the risk of fetal death is 20 % in perforated appendicitis however , the la was associated with shorter length of stay in the hospital as well as reduced risk of wound infection when an open appendectomy has been performed , the patient has a 2– to 3-inch ( 5–7.5 & nbsp ; cm ) scar , which will initially be heavily bruised one of the most common post-operative complications associated with an appendectomy is the development of a surgical site infection ( ssi ) on september 13 , 1980 , kurt semm performed the first laparoscopic appendectomy opening up the path for a much wider application of minimally invasive surgery a 2012 study a study by the agency for healthcare research and quality found that in 2010 , the average cost for a stay in the united states involving appendicitis was 7,800

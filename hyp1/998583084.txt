the latter was appointed the lpo 's chief conductor in 1962 , presiding over what one player described as '' an era of supremely good taste '' pritchard was also music director of glyndebourne festival opera in sussex , and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the lpo replaced the rpo as glyndebourne 's resident orchestra , providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months the number of lpo concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s , and ceased to be a major factor in the orchestra 's finances during the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared , including danny kaye , duke ellington and tony bennett in 1967 the lpo appointed bernard haitink as its principal conductor his concerts made a strong impression with the public , and within months the lpo was playing to ninety per cent capacity audiences at the festival hall , far outstripping the other london orchestras among the composers with whom haitink was associated were bruckner and mahler , whose symphonies featured frequently in the lpo 's concerts during the haitink period , as did those of shostakovich , particularly the tenth , which pirouet describes as the calling card of the orchestra and conductor with vladimir ashkenazy , haitink and the lpo gave a six-concert cycle of the beethoven symphonies and piano concertos , for which the festival hall was full to capacity in the times , joan chissell described the orchestra 's playing as '' worthy of any festival '' there was some discontent within the lpo that haitink 's prolific recordings were almost always with the other orchestra of which he was the chief conductor , the amsterdam concertgebouw in 1973 the lpo was caught up in a recurring phenomenon of london orchestral life : the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras is too much for one city , and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge on this occasion the targets were the lpo and the new philharmonia ; the latter , a self-governing body formed under its new name when the philharmonia was disbanded in 1964 , was going through a bad patch , professionally and financially when haitink announced in 1977 that he would step down as principal conductor at the end of the 1978â€“79 season , solti , who had been principal guest conductor since 1971 , agreed to succeed him at the anniversary concert solti conducted the programme with which beecham had inaugurated the lpo in the guardian , edward greenfield wrote , '' i doubt if the lpo has ever played so beautifully , even in the days of beecham '' as with haitink and solti , bruckner and mahler were prominent in the lpo 's concerts with tennstedt in 1984 the lpo and the philharmonia began negotiations that went on for years following an arts council proposal to name one london orchestra as the principal resident orchestra of the festival hall , with concomitant extra funding he continued to appear with the lpo as a guest , with the title of '' conductor laureate '' ; in 1989 richard morrison of the times wrote that the lpo still played better for tennstedt than for anyone else '' why all those insults made me stronger '' , the daily telegraph , 18 august 2005 he brought with him a recording contract with emi , but management turnover , financial stresses , and political disputes at the southbank centre at the time contributed to the difficulty of the working atmosphere in the orchestra during the interregnum , the orchestra inaugurated its '' roots classical fusions '' series , which aimed to combine musical traditions from around the world ; this was part of an education and community programme launched by the orchestra in april 2020 , the lpo announced the appointment of canellakis as its new principal guest conductor , the first female conductor ever named to the post , effective from september 2020 the orchestra 's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert ; with sargent and the royal choral society the lpo recorded choruses from messiah and the creation at kingsway hall in september 1932 & nbsp ; 72 from then until his last lpo recording in december 1945 beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra in most lpo recordings for lyrita the conductor was boult ; in the same period he also recorded extensively for emi , with the lpo his preferred orchestra the orchestra played for ten films made during the second world war , and then did little soundtrack work until the 1970s , with the major exception of lawrence of arabia ( 1962 )

on 29 march 2016 , an announcement was made by the swedish tax agency that a petition to have wallenberg declared dead in absentia was submitted in may 1996 , the central intelligence agency ( cia ) released thousands of previously classified documents regarding raoul wallenberg , in response to requests filed under the freedom of information act the documents also included a 1954 memo from an anonymous cia source that identified a hungarian-exile living in stockholm who , according to the author , assisted in inserting wallenberg into hungary during wwii as an agent of oss another declassified memorandum written in 1990 by the curator of the cia 's cia library , william henhoeffer , characterized the conclusion that wallenberg was working for the oss while in budapest as being '' essentially correct '' more telling was a communique sent on 7 november 1944 by the oss 's secret intelligence branch in bari , italy , which apparently acknowledged that wallenberg was acting as an unofficial liaison between the oss and the anti-fascism ( mfm ) , an underground resistance during world war ii the oss message notes wallenberg 's contacts with geza soos , a high-ranking mfm leader and further explains that soos '' may only be contacted '' through the swedish legation in budapest , which was wallenberg 's workplace and also served as the operational center for his attempts to aid the hungarian jews the same message 's assertion that wallenberg '' will know if he ( soos ) is not in budapest '' is also curious , in that by november 1944 soos was in hiding and knowledge of his whereabouts would only have been available to individuals closely involved with the mfm this particular disclosure has given rise to speculation as to whether , in addition to his efforts to rescue the hungarian jews , wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing hungary 's pro-nazi government on behalf of the oss this would also seem to add some credence to the potential explanation that it was his association with us intelligence that led to wallenberg being targeted by soviet authorities in january 1945 another of wallenberg 's nieces , louise von dardel , is the main activist in the family and dedicates much of her time to speaking about wallenberg and lobbying various countries to help uncover information about her uncle israeli historian yehuda bauer , who puts the number of lives saved by wallenberg at 4,500 , states lutz and other neutral emissaries saved more jews , but wallenberg was the only one who frequently confronted the nazis and their arrow cross accomplices wallenberg , featuring stellan skarsg√•rd , and various documentaries , such as raoul wallenberg : buried alive ( 1984 ) , the afi award-winning raoul wallenberg , between the lines ( 1985 ) and searching for wallenberg ( 2003 )

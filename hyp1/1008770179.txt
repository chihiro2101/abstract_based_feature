huygens separated from cassini orbiter at 02:00 utc on december 25 , 2004 in spacecraft event time huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa ) there was a transit of the earth and moon across the sun as seen from saturn/titan just hours before the landing huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon however , the transit did not interfere with the cassini orbiter or huygens probe , for two reasons second , huygens did not send any readable data directly to earth rather , it transmitted data to the cassini orbiter , which later relayed to earth the data received huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere huygens atmospheric structure instrument ( hasi ) this instrument contains a suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of titan 's atmosphere with the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known , it was possible to determine the density of titan 's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable on the surface of titan , the electrical conductivity and permittivity ( i.e the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects between , huygens was buffeted by rapidly fluctuating winds , which are thought to be vertical wind shear just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface , which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption the descent imager/spectral radiometer ( disr ) experiment on the huygens entry probe of titan a penetrometer instrument , that protruded past the bottom of the huygens descent module , was used to create a penetrometer trace as huygens landed on the surface this was because under the original flight plan , when huygens was to descend to titan , it would have accelerated relative to cassini , causing the doppler shift of its signal to vary doppler radio measurements of huygens from earth were made , although they were not as accurate as the lost measurements that cassini made the probe landed on the surface of titan at

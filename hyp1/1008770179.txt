huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa the probe landed on the surface of titan at about 10.6°s , 192.3°w around 12:43 utc in scet ( 2 & nbsp ; hours 30 & nbsp ; minutes after atmospheric entry ) ) there was a transit of the earth and moon across the sun as seen from saturn/titan just hours before the landing huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon first , although they could not receive any signal from earth because it was in front of the sun , earth could still listen to them second , huygens did not send any readable data directly to earth rather , it transmitted data to the cassini orbiter , which later relayed to earth the data received huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere this instrument contains a suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of titan 's atmosphere the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable on the surface of titan , the electrical conductivity and permittivity ( i.e the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects failure of ground controllers to turn on the receiver in the cassini orbiter caused the loss of this data measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes finally , the gc/ms measured the composition of titan 's surface the ssp contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of titan 's surface at the point of impact , whether the surface was solid or liquid the trace has an initial spike which suggests that the instrument hit one of the icy pebbles on the surface photographed by the disr camera this was because under the original flight plan , when huygens was to descend to titan , it would have accelerated relative to cassini , causing the doppler shift of its signal to vary all doppler radio measurements between cassini and huygens were lost as well the probe landed on the surface of titan at image : pia20713-titan-saturnmoon-labeledfeaturesiau-june2015.jpg thumb center 800px the red cross marks the landing site of huygens

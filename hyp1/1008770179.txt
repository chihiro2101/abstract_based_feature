huygens separated from cassini orbiter at 02:00 utc on december 25 , 2004 in spacecraft event time huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa the probe landed on the surface of titan at about 10.6°s , 192.3°w around 12:43 utc in scet ( 2 & nbsp ; hours 30 & nbsp ; minutes after atmospheric entry ) ) there was a transit of the earth and moon across the sun as seen from saturn/titan just hours before the landing huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon however , the transit did not interfere with the cassini orbiter or huygens probe , for two reasons rather , it transmitted data to the cassini orbiter , which later relayed to earth the data received huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere with the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known , it was possible to determine the density of titan 's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable on the surface of titan , the electrical conductivity and permittivity ( i.e the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface , which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption left this instrument is a gas chemical analyzer that was designed to identify and measure chemicals in titan 's atmosphere finally , the gc/ms measured the composition of titan 's surface a penetrometer instrument , that protruded past the bottom of the huygens descent module , was used to create a penetrometer trace as huygens landed on the surface this was done by measuring the force exerted on the instrument by the body 's surface as it broke through and was pushed down into the body by the landing huygens was programmed to transmit telemetry and scientific data to the cassini orbiter for relay to earth using two redundant s-band radio systems , referred to as channel a and b , or chain a and b doppler radio measurements of huygens from earth were made , although they were not as accurate as the lost measurements that cassini made the use of accelerometer sensors on huygens and vlbi tracking of the position of the huygens probe from earth allowed reasonably accurate wind speed and direction calculations to be made

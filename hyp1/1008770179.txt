huygens separated from cassini orbiter at 02:00 utc on december 25 , 2004 in spacecraft event time huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa the probe landed on the surface of titan at about 10.6°s , 192.3°w around 12:43 utc in scet ( 2 & nbsp ; hours 30 & nbsp ; minutes after atmospheric entry ) ) there was a transit of the earth and moon across the sun as seen from saturn/titan just hours before the landing huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon however , the transit did not interfere with the cassini orbiter or huygens probe , for two reasons first , although they could not receive any signal from earth because it was in front of the sun , earth could still listen to them huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere this instrument contains a suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of titan 's atmosphere with the aerodynamic properties of the probe already known , it was possible to determine the density of titan 's atmosphere and to detect wind gusts the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable on the surface of titan , the electrical conductivity and permittivity ( i.e the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes at ground level , the earth-based doppler shift and vlbi measurements show gentle winds of a few metres per second , roughly in line with expectations as huygens was primarily an atmospheric mission , the disr instrument was optimized to study the radiation balance inside titan 's atmosphere aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site , which , surprisingly , became clearly visible only below altitude this investigation was made possible by heating the gc/ms instrument just prior to impact in order to vaporize the surface material upon contact the ssp contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of titan 's surface at the point of impact , whether the surface was solid or liquid doppler radio measurements of huygens from earth were made , although they were not as accurate as the lost measurements that cassini made the probe landed on the surface of titan at

huygens separated from cassini orbiter at 02:00 utc on december 25 , 2004 in spacecraft event time huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa the probe landed on the surface of titan at about 10.6°s , 192.3°w around 12:43 utc in scet ( 2 & nbsp ; hours 30 & nbsp ; minutes after atmospheric entry ) ) there was a transit of the earth and moon across the sun as seen from saturn/titan just hours before the landing huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon however , the transit did not interfere with the cassini orbiter or huygens probe , for two reasons first , although they could not receive any signal from earth because it was in front of the sun , earth could still listen to them rather , it transmitted data to the cassini orbiter , which later relayed to earth the data received huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere this instrument contains a suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of titan 's atmosphere accelerometers measured forces in all three axes as the probe descended through the atmosphere the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable on the surface of titan , the electrical conductivity and permittivity ( i.e measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site , which , surprisingly , became clearly visible only below altitude all measurements were timed by aid of a shadow bar , which would tell disr when the sun had passed through the field of view just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface , which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are completely blocked out by atmospheric methane absorption the descent imager/spectral radiometer ( disr ) experiment on the huygens entry probe of titan a penetrometer instrument , that protruded past the bottom of the huygens descent module , was used to create a penetrometer trace as huygens landed on the surface all doppler radio measurements between cassini and huygens were lost as well the probe landed on the surface of titan at

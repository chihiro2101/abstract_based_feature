huygens separated from cassini orbiter at 02:00 utc on december 25 , 2004 in spacecraft event time huygens entered titan 's atmosphere at 10:13 utc on january 14 , 2005 in scet , according to esa the probe landed on the surface of titan at about 10.6°s , 192.3°w around 12:43 utc in scet ( 2 & nbsp ; hours 30 & nbsp ; minutes after atmospheric entry ) huygens entered the upper layer of titan 's atmosphere 2.7 & nbsp ; hours after the end of the transit of the earth , or only one or two minutes after the end of the transit of the moon however , the transit did not interfere with the cassini orbiter or huygens probe , for two reasons rather , it transmitted data to the cassini orbiter , which later relayed to earth the data received huygens had six instruments aboard that took in a wide range of scientific data as the probe descended through titan 's atmosphere this instrument contains a suite of sensors that measured the physical and electrical properties of titan 's atmosphere accelerometers measured forces in all three axes as the probe descended through the atmosphere the probe was designed so that in the event of a landing on a liquid surface , its motion due to waves would also have been measurable the hasi subsystem also contains a microphone , which was used to record any acoustic events during probe 's descent and landing ; this was the first time in history that audible sounds from another planetary body had been recorded this experiment used an ultra-stable oscillator which provided a precise s-band carrier frequency that allowed the cassini orbiter to accurately determine huygens ' radial velocity with respect to cassini via the doppler effect the wind-induced horizontal motion from huygens would 've been derived from the measured doppler shift measurements , corrected for all known orbit and propagation effects measurements started above titan 's surface , where huygens was blown eastwards at more than , agreeing with earlier measurements of the winds at altitude , made over the past few years using telescopes as huygens was primarily an atmospheric mission , the disr instrument was optimized to study the radiation balance inside titan 's atmosphere the descent imager/spectral radiometer ( disr ) experiment on the huygens entry probe of titan left this instrument is a gas chemical analyzer that was designed to identify and measure chemicals in titan 's atmosphere the ssp contained a number of sensors designed to determine the physical properties of titan 's surface at the point of impact , whether the surface was solid or liquid martin-baker space systems was responsible for huygens parachute systems and the structural components , mechanisms and pyrotechnics that control the probe 's descent onto titan huygens was programmed to transmit telemetry and scientific data to the cassini orbiter for relay to earth using two redundant s-band radio systems , referred to as channel a and b , or chain a and b all doppler radio measurements between cassini and huygens were lost as well

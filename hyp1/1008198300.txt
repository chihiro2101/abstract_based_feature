the hobgoblin was created by writer roger stern and artist john romita jr like other writers , stern found himself under pressure to have spider-man fight the green goblin again , but did not wish to bring norman osborn or bart hamilton back from the dead , have harry osborn be the green goblin again , or create yet another green goblin stern instead created a new concept as heir to the goblin legacy and developed the hobgoblin stern recounts that he directed romita to base the costume on the green goblin 's but to make it '' a little more medieval-looking '' , while romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the green goblin as a basis the hobgoblin 's identity was not initially revealed , generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the spider-man comics it was roderick kingsley , that sunuvabitch corporate leader i had introduced in my first issue of the spectacular spider-man the spectacular spider-man '' a handful of readers deduced that kingsley was the hobgoblin almost immediately stern 's original plan was to have the hobgoblin 's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the green goblin 's identity , meaning the truth would be revealed in the amazing spider-man 264 however , stern left after the amazing spider-man 251 , and editor tom defalco took his place wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to stern 's stories , defalco asked stern who the hobgoblin was , but objected when stern said it was kingsley moreover , he decided that the hobgoblin 's mystery should be prolonged as long as possible , since it was the chief element that made the hobgoblin interesting through both stern and defalco 's runs , mystery answer was continuously teased on the cover art , with the covers of amazing spider-man 245 , 251 , and 276 all showing spider-man unmasking the hobgoblin when owsley asked who the hobgoblin was at a creators conference , defalco lied and said the man in question was ned leeds

the hobgoblin 's identity as the foreigner thus , the hobgoblin 's identity was revealed posthumously in the amazing spider-man 289 ( a double-sized issue ) with spider-man 's archenemy now dead , a new storyline was created from jason macendale 's hatred of the hobgoblin stern was unhappy with the hobgoblin 's civilian identity revelation was leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries spider-man : hobgoblin lives in 1997 , with the retcon that kingsley was the original hobgoblin while leeds was brainwashed into serving as a fall guy , macendale is killed off , and kingsley returned according to stern , initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two hobgoblins , and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that kingsley kill macendale and return to operating

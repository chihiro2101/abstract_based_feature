like other writers , stern found himself under pressure to have spider-man fight the green goblin again , but did not wish to bring norman osborn or bart hamilton back from the dead , have harry osborn be the green goblin again , or create yet another green goblin stern instead created a new concept as heir to the goblin legacy and developed the hobgoblin stern recounts that he directed romita to base the costume on the green goblin 's but to make it '' a little more medieval-looking '' , while romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the green goblin as a basis the hobgoblin 's identity was not initially revealed , generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the spider-man comics it was roderick kingsley , that sunuvabitch corporate leader i had introduced in my first issue of the spectacular spider-man the spectacular spider-man in order to throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a retroactive continuity for his inconsistent characterization of kingsley in his early appearances , stern came up with the idea of kingsley having his brother daniel kingsley sometimes impersonate him , sealing the deception by having the hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as kingsley in amazing spider-man 249 stern 's original plan was to have the hobgoblin 's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the green goblin 's identity , meaning the truth would be revealed in the amazing spider-man 264 however , stern left after the amazing spider-man 251 , and editor tom defalco took his place wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to stern 's stories , defalco asked stern who the hobgoblin was , but objected when stern said it was kingsley '' upon reviewing the clues , defalco decided that the hobgoblin was richard fisk moreover , he decided that the hobgoblin 's mystery should be prolonged as long as possible , since it was the chief element that made the hobgoblin interesting through both stern and defalco 's runs , mystery answer was continuously teased on the cover art , with the covers of amazing spider-man 245 , 251 , and 276 all showing spider-man unmasking the hobgoblin owsley then wrote the one-shot spider-man vs wolverine in which leeds is killed off ( though the actual death is not shown ) , and instructed the spectacular spider-man writer peter david to reveal the hobgoblin 's identity as the foreigner david objected and argued that the only person who fit the clues was leeds ; having been present at the spider-man creator 's conference , david also thought that leeds was who defalco intended it to be with spider-man 's archenemy now dead , a new storyline was created from jason macendale 's hatred of the hobgoblin from 1987 to 1997 , macendale initially wielded only the hobgoblin 's weaponry but the 1988-1989 inferno crossover writer gerry conway had macendale imbued with demonic powers by n'astirh in addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than that of the original hobgoblin , these powers also disfigure macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the hobgoblin mask , and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal stern was unhappy with the hobgoblin 's civilian identity revelation was leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries spider-man : hobgoblin lives in 1997 , with the retcon that kingsley was the original hobgoblin while leeds was brainwashed into serving as a fall guy , macendale is killed off , and kingsley returned according to stern , initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two hobgoblins , and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that kingsley kill macendale and return to operating as the hobgoblin he decided to create a name criminal for himself by altering norman osborn 's goblin formula and improve the goblin costume/equipment in order to be the original hobgoblin spider-man : hobgoblin lives 1 ( january 1997 ) when his villainous identity is finally exposed by spider-man and betty brant , he flees to the caribbean to hide from both the law and his enemies amazing spider-man 259-261 after his twin brother amazing spider-man 691 is murdered by phil urich , the amazing spider-man 649 roderick returns to new york and dons his old hobgoblin costume similar to osborn , donovan was a test subject mix the two vital chemicals that were mixed into the goblin formula , disfiguring donovan 's face and granting superhuman abilities daniel kingsley is roderick kingsley 's twin brother now in protective custody , daniel was unknowingly used by roderick to blackmail norman osborn , resulting in the hobgoblin to swoop in to collect daniel spectacular spider-man 261 ( september 1998 ) kingsley later returned to new york , posing as his twin brother as the hobgoblin kingsley gets stunned by urich 's '' lunatic laugh '' long enough for urich to kill him using his own sword , allowing his killer to claim the hobgoblin mantle norman osborn briefly impersonated the original hobgoblin the goblin knight discovered who the hobgoblin that killed was and destroyed claude 's body to keep the goblin king from finding out who was impersonating hobgoblin while brainwashed , ned leeds wore the hobgoblin 's uniform and used the glider and equipment which included jack o'lantern bombs , razor bats and electrical shock gloves hobgoblin 2211 is robin '' hobby '' / '' hob '' bourne , spider-man 's daughter the roderick kingsley incarnation of the hobgoblin appears in the marvel super hero adventures animated series , voiced by andrew francis the roderick kingsley incarnation of the hobgoblin appeared in spider-man : the video game , voiced by david hadinger an exclusive marvel 2099 incarnation of the hobgoblin appears in spider-man : shattered dimensions , voiced by steven blum the first ( series 2 ) was similar to that of the demonic jason macendale incarnation while the more recent one ( series 17 ) is similar to that of the original roderick kingsley incarnation the ned leeds incarnation of the hobgoblin appears in the islands of adventure ride the amazing adventures of spider-man , voiced by pat fraley

when phospholipids are exposed to water , they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the center of the sheet the center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water the assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( also called the hydrophobic effect ) an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system the lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions despite being only a few nanometers thick , the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section this portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9 & nbsp ; nm thick in phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region , approximately 0.5 & nbsp ; nm outside the hydrophobic core one common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane , which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4 & nbsp ; nm thick , but this value varies with chain length and chemistry core thickness also varies significantly with temperature , in particular near a phase transition in many naturally occurring bilayers , the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different in some cases , this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) it is possible to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric , although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells all lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition ( melt ) from the gel to liquid phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second this random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane unlike liquid phase bilayers , the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility the phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive van der waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules thus , at a given temperature , a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid this phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions while lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior , it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry of the phospholipids , the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) , accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells pc is a zwitterionic headgroup , as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but , because these local charges balance , no net charge these alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent the primary role of the lipid bilayer in biology is to separate aqueous compartments from their surroundings without some form of barrier delineating “ self ” from “ non-self , ” it is difficult to even define the concept of an organism or of life this barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below the nucleus , mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers , while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer ( such as the plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticula , golgi apparatus and lysosomes ) prokaryotes have only one lipid bilayer - the cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane ) all of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and , together , typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell in liver hepatocytes for example , the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell , whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent probably the most familiar form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission , whereby a nerve impulse that has reached the end of one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters this transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins gpcrs are responsible for much of the cell 's ability to sense its surroundings and , because of this important role , approximately 40 % of all modern drugs are targeted at gpcrs normally , phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side the presence of even a few nanometer-scale holes results in a dramatic increase in current lipid bilayers can not be seen in a traditional microscope because they are too thin natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent , so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers , much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer electron microscopy offers a higher resolution image 31 p-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used for studies of phospholipid bilayers and biological membranes in native conditions a new method to study lipid bilayers is atomic force microscopy ( afm ) because of this , the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins , sometimes even with single-molecule resolution lipid bilayers exhibit high levels of birefringence where the refractive index in the plane of the bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units lipid bilayers are complicated molecular systems with many degrees of freedom fusion is involved in many cellular processes , in particular in eukaryotes , since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes lipid bilayers can be created artificially in the lab to allow researchers to perform experiments that can not be done with natural bilayers among the most common model systems are : black lipid membranes ( blm ) supported lipid bilayers ( slb ) tethered bilayer lipid membranes ( t-blm ) vesicles model lipid bilayer ” this was the first time the bilayer structure had been universally assigned to all cell membranes as well as organelle membranes

when phospholipids are exposed to water , they self-assemble into a two-layered sheet with the hydrophobic tails pointing toward the center of the sheet the center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water the assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( also called the hydrophobic effect ) an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system this complex process includes non-covalent interactions such as van der waals forces , electrostatic and hydrogen bonds the lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions despite being only a few nanometers thick , the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section the first region on either side of the bilayer is the hydrophilic headgroup in phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region , approximately 0.5 & nbsp ; nm outside the hydrophobic core flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) in any case , once lipid asymmetry is established , it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow by utilizing two different monolayers in langmuir-blodgett deposition or a combination of langmuir-blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second this random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane thus , at a given temperature , a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid an unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain , disrupting the lipid packing this disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains this phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions while lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior , it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids , but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components other headgroups are also present to varying degrees and can include phosphatidylserine ( ps ) phosphatidylethanolamine ( pe ) and phosphatidylglycerol ( pg ) unlike pc , some of the other headgroups carry a net charge , which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer the primary role of the lipid bilayer in biology is to separate aqueous compartments from their surroundings this barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer it has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthesis capability being the production of more phospholipids the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below prokaryotes have only one lipid bilayer - the cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane ) many prokaryotes also have a cell wall , but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates , not lipids all of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and , together , typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell this transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released these vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins it is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome are membrane proteins an example of this is the cd59 protein , which identifies cells as “ self ” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system in addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes , it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling in spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function this resistance is typically quite high ( 10 8 ohm-cm 2 or more ) since the hydrophobic core is impermeable to charged species in order to see bilayers , researchers often use fluorescence microscopy a sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength , so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent , so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers , much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer in conjunction with rapid freezing techniques , electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport , for instance in demonstrating that exocytosis vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses a new method to study lipid bilayers is atomic force microscopy ( afm ) afm is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer , conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior utilizing this capability , afm has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores ( holes ) and phase transitions in supported bilayers this has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate dipole and quadrupole moments of lipid membranes most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and , as a consequence , have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer this effect is particularly pronounced for charged species , which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus , but like any liquid , the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers fusion is the process by which two lipid bilayers merge , resulting in one connected structure among the most common model systems are : black lipid membranes ( blm ) supported lipid bilayers ( slb ) tethered bilayer lipid membranes ( t-blm ) vesicles model lipid bilayer technical information on lipid properties and handling and lipid bilayer preparation techniques

the center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water the assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( also called the hydrophobic effect ) an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system the lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions despite being only a few nanometers thick , the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section in phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region , approximately 0.5 & nbsp ; nm outside the hydrophobic core one common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane , which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration in many naturally occurring bilayers , the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different by contrast , the outer ( extracellular ) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine , sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids the biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood , although it is clear that it is used in several different situations certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric , although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells this asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase all lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition ( melt ) from the gel to liquid phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second this random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane unlike liquid phase bilayers , the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact , increasing the strength of this interaction and , as a consequence , decreasing the lipid mobility transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails this disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains an example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter , which has a large percentage saturated fats , is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil , which is mostly unsaturated , is liquid if some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase , the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions , rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions while lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior , it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids , but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components other headgroups are also present to varying degrees and can include phosphatidylserine ( ps ) phosphatidylethanolamine ( pe ) and phosphatidylglycerol ( pg ) this barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below many prokaryotes also have a cell wall , but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates , not lipids all of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and , together , typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell the contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins the hiv virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface alternatively , some membrane proteins penetrate all the way through the bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell in addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes , it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling by applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current , the resistance of the bilayer is determined this resistance is typically quite high ( 10 8 ohm-cm 2 or more ) since the hydrophobic core is impermeable to charged species the sensitivity of this system is such that even the activity of single ion channels can be resolved lipid bilayers can not be seen in a traditional microscope because they are too thin 31 p-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used for studies of phospholipid bilayers and biological membranes in native conditions a new method to study lipid bilayers is atomic force microscopy ( afm ) rather than using a beam of light or particles , a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it , like a record player needle afm is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer , conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior another advantage is that afm does not require fluorescent or isotope labeling of the lipids , since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface because of this , the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins , sometimes even with single-molecule resolution afm can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers , hydration strongly affects the molecular and electronic structure of membrane phospholipids most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and , as a consequence , have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer compared to ions , water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer , as evidenced by osmosis the anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules two special classes of protein deal with the ionic gradients found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell , it is also the site of extensive signal transduction ( pdf ) other , more exotic applications are also being pursued such as the use of lipid bilayer membrane pores for dna sequencing by oxford nanolabs technical information on lipid properties and handling and lipid bilayer preparation techniques

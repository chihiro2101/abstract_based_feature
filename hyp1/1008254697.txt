the center of this bilayer contains almost no water and excludes molecules like sugars or salts that dissolve in water an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system the lipid bilayer is very thin compared to its lateral dimensions if a typical mammalian cell ( diameter ~10 micrometers ) were magnified to the size of a watermelon ( ~1 & nbsp ; ft/30 & nbsp ; cm ) , the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper despite being only a few nanometers thick , the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section these regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry , neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques this portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9 & nbsp ; nm thick in phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region , approximately 0.5 & nbsp ; nm outside the hydrophobic core one common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane , which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4 & nbsp ; nm thick , but this value varies with chain length and chemistry in many naturally occurring bilayers , the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different by contrast , the outer ( extracellular ) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine , sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids the biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood , although it is clear that it is used in several different situations flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases , which transfer lipids in the opposite direction , and scramblases , which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers ( as in apoptotic cells ) at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second this random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane the phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive van der waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules thus , at a given temperature , a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid an example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter , which has a large percentage saturated fats , is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil , which is mostly unsaturated , is liquid most natural membranes are a complex mixture of different lipid molecules if some of the components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase , the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions , rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean this phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated one particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions while lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior , it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids , but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components for instance , ps presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis , whereas ps in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization unlike pc , some of the other headgroups carry a net charge , which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer this barrier takes the form of a lipid bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below prokaryotes have only one lipid bilayer - the cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane ) many prokaryotes also have a cell wall , but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates , not lipids in contrast , eukaryotes have a range of organelles including the nucleus , mitochondria , lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum all of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and , together , typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell these vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins by applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current , the resistance of the bilayer is determined lipid bilayers can not be seen in a traditional microscope because they are too thin natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent , so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer this has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and , as a consequence , have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer this effect is particularly pronounced for charged species , which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules compared to ions , water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the bilayer , as evidenced by osmosis regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher chemical potential probably the most familiar and best studied example is the sodium channel , which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons in the reverse process , a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off , enclosing a portion of the extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell the primary mechanism of this interdependence is the large amount of lipid material involved in a typical cell , an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour thus , the elastic modulus of the bilayer is primarily determined by how much extra area is exposed to water when the lipid molecules are stretched apart it is not surprising given this understanding of the forces involved that studies have shown that k a varies strongly with osmotic pressure but only weakly with tail length and unsaturation fusion is the process by which two lipid bilayers merge , resulting in one connected structure fusion is involved in many cellular processes , in particular in eukaryotes , since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes this was an important advance , since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure lipid bilayers and the gramicidin channel ( requires java plugin ) pictures and movies showing the results of molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers

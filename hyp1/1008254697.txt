the assembly process is driven by interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( also called the hydrophobic effect ) an increase in interactions between hydrophobic molecules ( causing clustering of hydrophobic regions ) allows water molecules to bond more freely with each other , increasing the entropy of the system this complex process includes non-covalent interactions such as van der waals forces , electrostatic and hydrogen bonds if a typical mammalian cell ( diameter ~10 micrometers ) were magnified to the size of a watermelon ( ~1 & nbsp ; ft/30 & nbsp ; cm ) , the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper despite being only a few nanometers thick , the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section the first region on either side of the bilayer is the hydrophilic headgroup this portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9 & nbsp ; nm thick within this short distance , the water concentration drops from 2m on the headgroup side to nearly zero on the tail ( core ) side the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4 & nbsp ; nm thick , but this value varies with chain length and chemistry in many naturally occurring bilayers , the compositions of the inner and outer membrane leaflets are different in some cases , this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric , although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated is very different from that in cells by utilizing two different monolayers in langmuir-blodgett deposition or a combination of langmuir-blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a gel ( solid ) phase in both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer , but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second this random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander across the surface of the membrane unlike liquid phase bilayers , the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility the phase behavior of lipid bilayers is determined largely by the strength of the attractive van der waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules thus , at a given temperature , a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails an unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain , disrupting the lipid packing an example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter , which has a large percentage saturated fats , is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil , which is mostly unsaturated , is liquid this phase separation plays a critical role in biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated while lipid tails primarily modulate bilayer phase behavior , it is the headgroup that determines the bilayer surface chemistry most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids , but sphingolipids and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components for instance , ps presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis , whereas ps in growth plate vesicles is necessary for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization unlike pc , some of the other headgroups carry a net charge , which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer the partitioning ability of the lipid bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules can not easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core , as discussed in transport across the bilayer below the nucleus , mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers , while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid bilayer ( such as the plasma membrane , endoplasmic reticula , golgi apparatus and lysosomes ) prokaryotes have only one lipid bilayer - the cell membrane ( also known as the plasma membrane ) many prokaryotes also have a cell wall , but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates , not lipids all of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and , together , typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell in liver hepatocytes for example , the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell , whereas the endoplasmic reticulum contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent these vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell lipid bilayers are also involved in signal transduction through their role as the home of integral membrane proteins the hiv virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface gpcrs are responsible for much of the cell 's ability to sense its surroundings and , because of this important role , approximately 40 % of all modern drugs are targeted at gpcrs in addition to protein- and solution-mediated processes , it is also possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling normally , phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side the presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell by applying a voltage across the bilayer and measuring the resulting current , the resistance of the bilayer is determined in order to see bilayers , researchers often use fluorescence microscopy a sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength , so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers , much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer rather than using a beam of light or particles , a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it , like a record player needle utilizing this capability , afm has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores ( holes ) and phase transitions in supported bilayers another advantage is that afm does not require fluorescent or isotope labeling of the lipids , since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface afm can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers lipid bilayers exhibit high levels of birefringence where the refractive index in the plane of the bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units thus , atomistic simulation of membrane and in particular ab initio calculations of its properties is difficult and computationally expensive , hydration strongly affects the molecular and electronic structure of membrane phospholipids most polar molecules have low solubility in the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer and , as a consequence , have low permeability coefficients across the bilayer in both cases , these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles fusion is involved in many cellular processes , in particular in eukaryotes , since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes technical information on lipid properties and handling and lipid bilayer preparation techniques

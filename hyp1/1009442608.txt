canopus and her five sister ships were designed for service in east asia , where the new rising power japan was beginning to build a powerful navy , though this role was quickly made redundant by the anglo-japanese alliance of 1902 35 the canopus-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines , with steam provided by twenty belleville boilers the new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels , rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous british battleships 34 , 35 canopus had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft ; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading , although at a fixed elevation the ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates , in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats similarly , the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner ; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick in that battle one of the prizes taken by lord nelson 's fleet was the french ship franklin , renamed by the british canopus was commissioned by captain wilmot fawkes at portsmouth on 5 december 1899 for service in the mediterranean fleet 154 canopus returned to full commission on 9 may 1905 and relieved the battleship on the china station the alliance meant that the united kingdom could have a reduced presence on the china station and battleships were no longer required there , so canopus was recalled from colombo in june 1905 and thus was the only canopus-class battleship which did not serve on the china station upon her return to the united kingdom , canopus began service in the atlantic fleet on 22 july 1905 in january 1906 she transferred to the channel fleet and later that year was fitted with fire control on 10 march 1907 , she transferred to the portsmouth division of the home fleet at portsmouth , where she was reduced to a nucleus crew in may 1907 gardiner & gray , p her refit completed , canopus commissioned on 28 april 1908 for service in the mediterranean fleet in december 1909 , she was reduced to service in the 4th division , home fleet , undergoing a refit at chatham dockyard from july 1911 to april 1912 during this service 84 in early september , her sister ship relieved her and canopus transferred to the south america station to become guard ship there and provide support to the cruiser squadron of rear admiral christopher cradock 272–273 while en route , canopus nearly encountered the german light cruiser off brazil , but the german ship intercepted british radio signals before canopus could locate her cradock had initially intended to take canopus with his squadron , which consisted of the armoured cruisers and , the light cruiser glasgow and the auxiliary cruiser , but her late arrival , coupled with the fact that she required an overhaul upon arriving in the falklands , forced cradock to proceed without her cradock ordered canopus to join him when possible , though he intended to use her only to protect his colliers 357–359 canopus was still some south of cradock when he encountered spee 's squadron , and the german ships were faster than the british cruisers , preventing cradock from rejoining canopus in the ensuing battle of coronel , the east asia squadron sank both of cradock 's armoured cruisers and damaged glasgow ; by the time cradock was defeated , canopus was still away 369 shortly after news of the battle reached britain , the royal navy ordered all naval forces in the region to consolidate ; this included the remnants of cradock 's command , along with the armoured cruisers , , and in addition , a pair of battlecruisers— and —were detached from the grand fleet to hunt down and destroy spee 's squadron 379–380 canopus and glasgow returned to stanley , arriving there on 8 november 1914 ; they immediately proceeded to join the british warships concentrating off the river plate the ships fired for about two hours before the ottomans inside dardanus returned fire at 16:15 , which they did quite accurately , straddling canopus quickly and scoring a hit on her quarterdeck that damaged a wardroom the british ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses , but the battleship and then inflexible began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries 25 , 28 when her sister ship albion became stranded on a sandbank off gaba tepe under heavy fire on 22–23 may 1915 , canopus towed her free after the dardanelles campaign ended with the evacuation of allied forces from gallipoli in january 1916 , canopus was assigned to the british eastern mediterranean squadron , where she served until she returned to the united kingdom in april 1916

canopus and her five sister ships were designed for service in east asia , where the new rising power japan was beginning to build a powerful navy , though this role was quickly made redundant by the anglo-japanese alliance of 1902 they were the first british battleships with water-tube boilers , which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships the new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels , rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous british battleships the canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers , with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the majestics 34 , 35 canopus had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft ; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading , although at a fixed elevation the ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates , in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats similarly , the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner ; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick in that battle one of the prizes taken by lord nelson 's fleet was the french ship franklin , renamed by the british canopus was commissioned by captain wilmot fawkes at portsmouth on 5 december 1899 for service in the mediterranean fleet while in reserve , canopus was given an extensive refit by cammell laird at birkenhead that lasted from may 1903 to june 1904 returning to the commissioned reserve at portsmouth , she was rammed by the battleship in mount 's bay during manoeuvres on 5 august 1904 , suffering slight damage the alliance meant that the united kingdom could have a reduced presence on the china station and battleships were no longer required there , so canopus was recalled from colombo in june 1905 and thus was the only canopus-class battleship which did not serve on the china station upon her return to the united kingdom , canopus began service in the atlantic fleet on 22 july 1905 on 10 march 1907 , she transferred to the portsmouth division of the home fleet at portsmouth , where she was reduced to a nucleus crew in may 1907 gardiner & gray , p her refit completed , canopus commissioned on 28 april 1908 for service in the mediterranean fleet in 1913 and 1914 she was stationed at pembroke dock in wales as part of the 3rd fleet 84 in early september , her sister ship relieved her and canopus transferred to the south america station to become guard ship there and provide support to the cruiser squadron of rear admiral christopher cradock 272–273 while en route , canopus nearly encountered the german light cruiser off brazil , but the german ship intercepted british radio signals before canopus could locate her canopus departed the abrolhos rocks on 8 october 1914 to assist cradock 's ships in searching for the german east asia squadron of vice admiral maximilian von spee , which was en route the south atlantic from the far east canopus arrived at stanley in the falkland islands on 18 october 1914 , where she took up guard ship and escort duties cradock ordered canopus to join him when possible , though he intended to use her only to protect his colliers 357–359 canopus was still some south of cradock when he encountered spee 's squadron , and the german ships were faster than the british cruisers , preventing cradock from rejoining canopus in the ensuing battle of coronel , the east asia squadron sank both of cradock 's armoured cruisers and damaged glasgow ; by the time cradock was defeated , canopus was still away 369 shortly after news of the battle reached britain , the royal navy ordered all naval forces in the region to consolidate ; this included the remnants of cradock 's command , along with the armoured cruisers , , and sturdee 's battlecruisers , much faster than spee 's ships , eventually caught and destroyed the east asia squadron , with the exception of the light cruiser , which was able to outrun the british pursuers 433–445 canopus , still moored in the mud , remained behind at stanley and missed the rest of the battle 294 the french ships began to retreat , but canopus and the other british battleships continued the bombardment after the dardanelles campaign ended with the evacuation of allied forces from gallipoli in january 1916 , canopus was assigned to the british eastern mediterranean squadron , where she served until she returned to the united kingdom in april 1916

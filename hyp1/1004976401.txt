in humans , ovulation occurs about midway through the menstrual cycle , after the follicular phase the few days surrounding ovulation ( from approximately days 10 to 18 of a 28-day cycle ) , constitute the most fertile phase the time from the beginning of the last menstrual period ( lmp ) until ovulation is , on average , 14.6 days , but with substantial variation among females and between cycles in any single female , with an overall 95 % prediction interval of 8.2 to 20.5 days the process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland , luteinizing hormone ( lh ) and follicle-stimulating hormone ( fsh ) in the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle , the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion , which is stimulated by fsh the follicular phase ( or proliferative phase ) is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the ovarian follicles mature for ovulation to be successful , the ovum must be supported by the corona radiata and cumulus oophorus granulosa cells this lasts from 24 to 36 hours , and results in the rupture of the ovarian follicles , causing the oocyte to be released from the ovary if no fertilization occurs , the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation symptoms related to the onset of ovulation , the moment of ovulation and the body 's process of beginning and ending the menstrual cycle vary in intensity with each female but are fundamentally the same ivf.com > ovulation induction retrieved on mars 7 , 2010 by contrast , induced ovulation in some animal species occurs naturally , ovulation can be stimulated by coitus combined hormonal contraceptives inhibit follicular phase and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action in assisted reproductive technology including in vitro fertilization , cycles where a transvaginal oocyte retrieval is planned generally necessitates ovulation suppression , because it is not practically feasible to collect oocytes after ovulation

archaeological investigations at mytilene began in the late 19th century when robert koldewey ( later excavator of babylon ) and a group of german colleagues spent many months on the island preparing plans of the visible remains at various ancient sites like mytilene salvage excavations carried out by the archaeological service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the early bronze age although most have been much later ( hellenistic and roman ) it is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the roman architect vitruvius had written the great earthquake of february 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished ; the ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large north harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea ; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored the former contains the rich bronze age remains from thermi , a site north of mytilene dug by the british in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays ; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions , architectural pieces , and coins the latter museum is especially rich in mosaics and sculpture , including the famous late roman mosaic floor from the '' house of menander '' with scenes from plays by that athenian 4th-century bc playwright there are also mosaics and finds from other roman mansions excavated by the greek archaeological service under the direction of the archeologist aglaia archontidou-argyri alcaeus ( 6th century bc ) , greek poet hellanikos von mytilene , die fragmente der griechischen historiker no laomedon of mytilene ( 4th bc ) , general of alexander the great chares ( 4th century bc ) , greek historian and chamberlain to alexander the great scamon ( 4th century bc ) , greek historian and son of hellanicus lesbonax ( 1st century bc ) , greek sophist and rhetorician santa thomais ( 910â€“1030 ) , nun , philanthropist and healer christopher of mytilene ( 11th century ) , greek poet therapon by night file : mytilini - rathaus.jpg the city hall file : hotel pyrgos mytilinis.jpg hotel pyrgos file : mytilene 2005.jpg panoramic view file : mytilene 7-01 ( 38 ) list of ancient greek cities list of settlements in lesbos university of the aegean mytilene international airport ministry for the aegean

archaeological investigations at mytilene began in the late 19th century when robert koldewey ( later excavator of babylon ) and a group of german colleagues spent many months on the island preparing plans of the visible remains at various ancient sites like mytilene significant excavations , however , do not seem to have started until after the first world war when in the mid-1920s evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre ( according to plutarch it was the inspiration for pompey 's theatre in rome in 55 bc , the first permanent stone theatre in rome ) on the hill on the western side of town subsequent work in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s by various members of the archaeological service revealed more of the theatre , including a roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena salvage excavations carried out by the archaeological service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the early bronze age although most have been much later ( hellenistic and roman ) it is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the roman architect vitruvius had written the demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to demeter and kore and later also to cybele , the great mother goddess of anatolia a section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large north harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea ; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored the city has two excellent archaeological museums , one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure the former contains the rich bronze age remains from thermi , a site north of mytilene dug by the british in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays ; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions , architectural pieces , and coins there are also mosaics and finds from other roman mansions excavated by the greek archaeological service under the direction of the archeologist aglaia archontidou-argyri alcaeus ( 6th century bc ) , greek poet laomedon of mytilene ( 4th bc ) , general of alexander the great chares ( 4th century bc ) , greek historian and chamberlain to alexander the great santa thomais ( 910–1030 ) , nun , philanthropist and healer christopher of mytilene ( 11th century ) , greek poet leo rapitis ( 1906–1957 ) , greek singer konstantinos kenteris ( born 1973 ) , greek athlete alexis panselinos ( 1903–1984 ) , greek writer sophocles vournazos ( 1853–1889 ) , greek philanthropist and founder of mytilene 's academic buildings therapon by night file : mytilini - rathaus.jpg the city hall file : hotel pyrgos mytilinis.jpg hotel pyrgos file : mytilene 2005.jpg panoramic view file : mytilene 7-01 ( 38 )

archaeological investigations at mytilene began in the late 19th century when robert koldewey ( later excavator of babylon ) and a group of german colleagues spent many months on the island preparing plans of the visible remains at various ancient sites like mytilene subsequent work in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s by various members of the archaeological service revealed more of the theatre , including a roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena salvage excavations carried out by the archaeological service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the early bronze age although most have been much later ( hellenistic and roman ) it is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the roman architect vitruvius had written although conversion to a mosque after the ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves , some remained the great earthquake of february 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished ; the ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century a section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large north harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea ; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored the city has two excellent archaeological museums , one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure the latter museum is especially rich in mosaics and sculpture , including the famous late roman mosaic floor from the '' house of menander '' with scenes from plays by that athenian 4th-century bc playwright the university of aegean is housed in privately owned buildings , in rented buildings located in the city centre and in modern buildings on the university hill alcaeus ( 6th century bc ) , greek poet santa thomais ( 910–1030 ) , nun , philanthropist and healer christopher of mytilene ( 11th century ) , greek poet leo rapitis ( 1906–1957 ) , greek singer konstantinos kenteris ( born 1973 ) , greek athlete alexis panselinos ( 1903–1984 ) , greek writer sophocles vournazos ( 1853–1889 ) , greek philanthropist and founder of mytilene 's academic buildings therapon by night file : mytilini - rathaus.jpg the city hall file : hotel pyrgos mytilinis.jpg hotel pyrgos file : mytilene 2005.jpg panoramic view file : mytilene 7-01 ( 38 ) list of ancient greek cities list of settlements in lesbos university of the aegean mytilene international airport ministry for the aegean

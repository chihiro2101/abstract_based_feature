the crossbar switch has the property of being able to connect n inputs to n outputs in any bijection combination , so it can connect any caller to any non-busy receiver , a property given the technical term '' nonblocking '' however , the crossbar switch does so at the expense of using n 2 ( n squared ) simple spst switches further , large crossbar switches had physical problems the obvious way to emulate a crossbar switch was to find some way to build it from smaller crossbar switches if a crossbar switch could be emulated by some arrangement of smaller crossbar switches , then these smaller crossbar switches could also , in turn be emulated by even smaller crossbar switches the next approach was to break apart the crossbar switch into three layers of smaller crossbar switches a telephone system only has to make a one-to-one connection intuitively this seems to mean that the number of inputs and the number of outputs can always be equal in each subswitch , but intuition does not prove this can be done nor does it tell us how to do so so , each input subswitch will have a single wire to each middle subswitch since telephone switches are symmetric ( callers and callees are interchangeable ) , the same logic will apply to the output layer , and the middle subswitches will be '' square '' , having the same number of inputs as outputs theoretically , in the example , only four central switches are needed , each with exactly one connection to each input switch and one connection to each output switch this is called a '' minimal spanning switch , '' and managing it was the holy grail of the bell labs ' investigations if an output switch is also half full with connections from the other two middle switches , then there is no remaining middle switch which can provide a path between that input and output for this reason , sometimes this switch arrangement is called a '' 2n & minus ; 1 switch '' , where n is the number of input ports of the input subswitches those subswitches could in turn each be made of 3 & times ; 10 10 & times ; 10 crossbars , a total of 3000 contacts , making 900,000 for the whole exchange ; that is a far smaller number than 100 million managing a minimal spanning switch if a and b happen to be the same middle-layer switch , then the connection can be made immediately just as in the '' 2nâˆ’1 '' switch case the algorithm finds a new arrangement of the connections through the middle subswitches a and b which includes all of the existing connections , plus the desired new connection each connection is linked to at most two others by a shared input or output subswitch , forming one link in a '' chain '' of connections if this first connection 's output subswitch has a second connection , assign that second connection a path from its input subswitch through subswitch b if that input subswitch has another connection , assign that third connection a path through subswitch a in the first case , go back to the new connection 's input subswitch and follow its chain backward , assigning connections to paths through middle subswitches b and a in the same alternating pattern when this is done , each input or output subswitch in the chain has at most two connections passing through it , and they are assigned to different middle switches after the new connection pattern is designed in the software , then the electronics of the switch can actually be reprogrammed , physically moving the connections after several years , bell engineers began designing electromechanical switches that could be controlled by it conceptually , the crossbar switches of the three-stage switch can each be further decomposed into smaller crossbar switches design advantage : time-division switches have only one input and output wire when all connections are gone from a defective switch , the defective switch can be avoided , and later replaced

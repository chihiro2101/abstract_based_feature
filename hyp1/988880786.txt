the crossbar switch has the property of being able to connect n inputs to n outputs in any bijection combination , so it can connect any caller to any non-busy receiver , a property given the technical term '' nonblocking '' being nonblocking it could always complete a call ( to a non-busy receiver ) , which would maximize service availability however , the crossbar switch does so at the expense of using n 2 ( n squared ) simple spst switches for large n ( and the practical requirements of a phone switch are considered large ) this growth was too expensive further , large crossbar switches had physical problems engineers also noticed that at any time , each bar of a crossbar switch was only making a single connection this seemed to imply that most of the switching fabric of a crossbar switch was wasted the obvious way to emulate a crossbar switch was to find some way to build it from smaller crossbar switches if a crossbar switch could be emulated by some arrangement of smaller crossbar switches , then these smaller crossbar switches could also , in turn be emulated by even smaller crossbar switches the switching fabric could become very efficient , and possibly even be created from standardized parts the next approach was to break apart the crossbar switch into three layers of smaller crossbar switches '' the smaller switches are less massive , more reliable , and generally easier to build , and therefore less expensive a telephone system only has to make a one-to-one connection intuitively this seems to mean that the number of inputs and the number of outputs can always be equal in each subswitch , but intuition does not prove this can be done nor does it tell us how to do so further , on the output side , we could also have 4 output subswitches , each with 4 outputs , for a total of 16 outputs the basic algorithm for managing a three-layer switch is to search the middle subswitches for a middle subswitch that has unused wires to the needed input and output switches theoretically , in the example , only four central switches are needed , each with exactly one connection to each input switch and one connection to each output switch this is called a '' minimal spanning switch , '' and managing it was the holy grail of the bell labs ' investigations however , a bit of work with a pencil and paper will show that it is easy to get such a minimal switch into conditions in which no single middle switch has a connection to both the needed input switch and the needed output switch if an input switch is half-full , it has connections via two middle switches if an output switch is also half full with connections from the other two middle switches , then there is no remaining middle switch which can provide a path between that input and output managing a minimal spanning switch the algorithm proper only cares about the internal connections from input to output switch , although a practical implementation also has to keep track of the correct input and output switch connections '' this algorithm is a form of topological sort , and is the heart of the algorithm that controls a minimal spanning switch after several years , bell engineers began designing electromechanical switches that could be controlled by it conceptually , the crossbar switches of the three-stage switch can each be further decomposed into smaller crossbar switches since they have far fewer electrical connections to fail , they are far more reliable than space-division switches , and are therefore the preferred switches for the outer ( input and output ) layers of modern telephone switches switches typically interface to other switches and fiber optic networks via fast multiplexed data lines such as sonet

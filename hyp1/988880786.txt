the crossbar switch has the property of being able to connect n inputs to n outputs in any bijection combination , so it can connect any caller to any non-busy receiver , a property given the technical term '' nonblocking '' not only did the switch require too much space , but the metal bars containing the switch contacts would become so long that they would sag and become unreliable engineers also noticed that at any time , each bar of a crossbar switch was only making a single connection this seemed to imply that most of the switching fabric of a crossbar switch was wasted the obvious way to emulate a crossbar switch was to find some way to build it from smaller crossbar switches if a crossbar switch could be emulated by some arrangement of smaller crossbar switches , then these smaller crossbar switches could also , in turn be emulated by even smaller crossbar switches completely connected 3-layer switches the next approach was to break apart the crossbar switch into three layers of smaller crossbar switches further , on the output side , we could also have 4 output subswitches , each with 4 outputs , for a total of 16 outputs so , each input subswitch will have a single wire to each middle subswitch the basic algorithm for managing a three-layer switch is to search the middle subswitches for a middle subswitch that has unused wires to the needed input and output switches theoretically , in the example , only four central switches are needed , each with exactly one connection to each input switch and one connection to each output switch if an input switch is half-full , it has connections via two middle switches if an output switch is also half full with connections from the other two middle switches , then there is no remaining middle switch which can provide a path between that input and output for this reason , sometimes this switch arrangement is called a '' 2n & minus ; 1 switch '' , where n is the number of input ports of the input subswitches the crucial discovery was a way to reorganize connections in the middle switches to '' trade wires '' so that a new connection could be completed since , prior to the arrival of the new connection , the input and output subswitches each had at least one unused connection , both of these unused links must exist in this list , each input subswitch can appear in at most two connections : one to subswitch a , and one to subswitch b each connection is linked to at most two others by a shared input or output subswitch , forming one link in a '' chain '' of connections assign it the path from its input subswitch , through middle subswitch a , to its output subswitch if this first connection 's output subswitch has a second connection , assign that second connection a path from its input subswitch through subswitch b if that input subswitch has another connection , assign that third connection a path through subswitch a eventually one of two things must happen : the chain terminates in a subswitch with only one connection , or the chain loops back to the originally chosen connection when this is done , each input or output subswitch in the chain has at most two connections passing through it , and they are assigned to different middle switches conceptually , the crossbar switches of the three-stage switch can each be further decomposed into smaller crossbar switches since they have far fewer electrical connections to fail , they are far more reliable than space-division switches , and are therefore the preferred switches for the outer ( input and output ) layers of modern telephone switches practical digital telephonic switches minimize the size and expense of the electronics the scarce resources in a telephone switch are the connections between layers of subswitches

and vienna the service on this route was known as the simplon orient express , and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route the simplon orient express soon became the most important rail route between paris and i̇stanbul the 1930s saw the orient express services at its most popular , with three parallel services running : the orient express , the simplon orient express , and also the arlberg orient express , which ran via zürich and innsbruck to budapest , with sleeper cars running onwards from there to bucharest and athens during this time , the orient express acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury , carrying sleeping-cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their cuisine each of the orient express services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from calais to paris , thus extending the service from one end of continental europe to the other the start of the second world war in 1939 again interrupted the service , which did not resume until 1945 during the war , the german mitropa company had run some services on the route through the balkans , but yugoslav partisans frequently sabotaged the track , forcing a stop to this service following the end of the war , normal services resumed except on the athens leg , where the closure of the border between yugoslavia and the kingdom of greece prevented services from running that border re-opened in 1951 , but the closure of the bulgarian–turkish border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to i̇stanbul during that time this was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the direct orient express , which ran daily cars from paris to belgrade , and twice weekly services from paris to i̇stanbul and athens 1976 saw the withdrawal of the paris–athens direct service , and in 1977 , the direct orient express was withdrawn completely , with the last paris–i̇stanbul service running on 19 may of that year the withdrawal of the direct orient express was thought by many to signal the end of the orient express as a whole , but in fact a service under this name continued to run from paris to bucharest as before ( via strasbourg , munich , and budapest ) this continued until 2001 , when the service was cut back to just paris–vienna , already in euronight quality – but in both cases the coaches were in fact rather attached to a paris–strasbourg express this service continued daily , listed in the timetables under the name orient express , until 8 june 2007 with the opening of the lgv est paris–strasbourg high speed rail line on 10 june 2007 , the orient express service was further cut back to strasbourg–vienna , departing nightly at 22:20 from strasbourg , and still bearing the name , but lost the number 262/263 which was owned for decades the remains of the train had a convenient connection from/to the strasbourg-paris tgv , but due to the less flexible prices the changing has become less attractive in the last years through coaches between vienna and karlsruhe ( continuing first to dortmund , then to amsterdam , and finally – partly from budapest – to frankfurt ) were attached on 8 december 2020 , it was announced that sleeper service between vienna and paris via munich would be reestablished in 2021 train services across the border to turkey were stopped through several years due to construction works , but they were

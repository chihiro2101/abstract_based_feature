if it is the most popular , his/her family immediately wins the face-off otherwise , the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins the family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers , with each member giving one answer in sequence giving an answer not on the board , or failing to respond within the allotted time , earns one strike if the family earns three strikes , their opponents are given one chance to '' steal '' the points for the round by guessing any remaining concealed answer ; failing to do so awards the points back to the family that originally had control answers are worth one point for every person in the 100-member survey who gave them the winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question , including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal ( if applicable ) the number of answers on the board decreases from round to round , and as the game progresses , certain rounds are played for double or triple point value the only time a goal was not used was for the first four years of the 1999 syndicated series , where the highest scoring family after four rounds , the last of which was played for triple points and used only one strike , was declared the winner in the original periodic primetime specials , three games were played , with the first two using the original scoring system for game 3 , just one question round was done , with the winning two celebrity teams from the previous rounds playing two members of the winning family play fast money for a chance to win a cash bonus the clock begins to run only after the first question is asked , and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked , if time remains if the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more , the family wins the bonus in the original periodic primetime specials , each game was followed by a fast money round when family feud premiered on abc , network rules dictated how much a family could win for these episodes , two new families competed in this first half of each episode the second half featured former champion families who appeared on family feud between 1977 and 1985 , with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half the returning champions rule was reinstated with the same five-day limit starting with the 2002–03 season starting with the 2009–10 season , a family that wins five matches also wins a new car ( currently a ford ranger ) in june 1992 , the cbs daytime edition of feud expanded from 30 to 60 minutes and became known as the family feud challenge the bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in september 1992 , which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the new family feud the first two members of each family appeared at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available for the second half of the daytime version , and also on the syndicated version , all values were doubled , making the maximum potential bank 20,000 the team that eventually won the game played for their bank in fast money when richard dawson returned as host of the program in 1994 , the round 's name was changed to the '' bankroll '' round although the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer , the format was modified to three questions from five , with only one member of each family participating for all three questions the initial stake for each family remained the same ( 2,500 in the first half of the hour and 5,000 in the second ) thus , the original abc and first syndicated versions of family feud were hosted by dawson marsh attributed family feuds popularity to dawson 's '' glib familiarity '' ( he had previously played newkirk on hogan 's heroes ) and '' ready wit '' ( from his tenure as a panelist on match game ) the show 's original announcer was gene wood , with johnny gilbert and rod roddy serving as occasional substitutes combs hosted the program until the daytime version 's cancellation in 1993 and the syndicated version until the end of the 1993–94 season richard karn was selected to take over for anderson when season four premiered in 2002 , and when season eight premiered in 2006 , karn was replaced by john o'hurley in 2010 , both o'hurley and richardson departed from the show ;

two family teams of five contestants ( reduced to four contestants for the 1994–95 season ) each compete to win cash and prizes the original version of the show began with the families being introduced , seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits , after which the host interviewed them the minimum age to participate in family feud is 15 , although every family must have at least one person who is 18 years or older a certain number of answers are concealed on the board , ranked by popularity of the survey 's responses the first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer ; if it is the most popular , his/her family immediately wins the face-off if neither contestant 's answer is on the board , the other eight contestants have a chance to respond , one at a time from alternating sides , until an answer is revealed the family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers , with each member giving one answer in sequence giving an answer not on the board , or failing to respond within the allotted time , earns one strike from 1992 to 2003 , the value of the '' stealing '' answer would be credited to the '' stealing '' family the winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question , including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal ( if applicable ) the number of answers on the board decreases from round to round , and as the game progresses , certain rounds are played for double or triple point value for most of the show 's existence , the first team to reach or surpass a certain point total won the game when the original series first premiered , the goal was 200 points and for its final year , it was increased to 400 points the current series continues to be played in four rounds , but if neither family reaches 300 by the end of the fourth round a sudden death question is played in the original periodic primetime specials , three games were played , with the first two using the original scoring system for game 3 , just one question round was done , with the winning two celebrity teams from the previous rounds playing one contestant is onstage with the host , while the other is sequestered backstage with headphones so that they can not see or hear the first portion of the round the first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them ( originally 15 seconds , extended to 20 in 1994 ) after the first contestant has either answered all five questions or run out of time , the board is cleared except for the total score , and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions if the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more , the family wins the bonus in 2001 , at the request of then-host louie anderson , the prize was doubled to 20,000 , where it has remained since when family feud premiered on abc , network rules dictated how much a family could win the cbs daytime and syndicated versions which began airing in 1988 also featured returning champions , who could appear for a maximum of five days for a brief period in the 1994–95 season which aired in syndication , there were no returning champions as part of the change , a new round was added at the start of each game called '' bullseye '' each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it the bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in september 1992 , which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the new family feud the first two members of each family appeared at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available the team that eventually won the game played for their bank in fast money although the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer , the format was modified to three questions from five , with only one member of each family participating for all three questions however , the value for each question was 500 , 1,500 and 2,500 in the first half , with values doubling for the second half it was played similarly to the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated version , with five questions worth from 1,000 to 5,000 when family feud was conceived in 1976 ,

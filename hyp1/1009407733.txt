the original version of the show began with the families being introduced , seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits , after which the host interviewed them the minimum age to participate in family feud is 15 , although every family must have at least one person who is 18 years or older each round begins with a '' face-off '' question that serves as a toss-up between two opposing contestants the first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer ; if it is the most popular , his/her family immediately wins the face-off if neither contestant 's answer is on the board , the other eight contestants have a chance to respond , one at a time from alternating sides , until an answer is revealed the family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents ( except on the 1988–95 versions , when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question ) if the opponents are given the opportunity to '' steal '' the points , then only their team 's captain is required to answer the question for most of the series , this is done after the family confers with each other ; the only exception was on the 1988 series where each family member was polled for an answer with the team captain having the option to either select one of the family 's answers or give a different answer the winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question , including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal ( if applicable ) the number of answers on the board decreases from round to round , and as the game progresses , certain rounds are played for double or triple point value for most of the show 's existence , the first team to reach or surpass a certain point total won the game on the first two series a match continued until a family reached the goal the question consists of only the 1 answer in a survey and is played for triple point value two members of the winning family play fast money for a chance to win a cash bonus the first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them ( originally 15 seconds , extended to 20 in 1994 ) the clock begins to run only after the first question is asked , and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked , if time remains after the first contestant has either answered all five questions or run out of time , the board is cleared except for the total score , and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions if the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more , the family wins the bonus if not , they are given 5 per point scored as a consolation prize in the original periodic primetime specials , each game was followed by a fast money round when family feud premiered on abc , network rules dictated how much a family could win for these episodes , two new families competed in this first half of each episode the second half featured former champion families who appeared on family feud between 1977 and 1985 , with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half from 1999 to 2002 , two new families appeared on each episode each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it the bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in september 1992 , which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the new family feud the first two members of each family appeared at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family 's bank on the first half of the daytime version , families were staked with 2,500 for the second half of the daytime version , and also on the syndicated version , all values were doubled , making the maximum potential bank 20,000 the initial stake for each family remained the same ( 2,500 in the first half of the hour and 5,000 in the second ) however , the value for each question was 500 , 1,500 and 2,500 in the first half , with values doubling for the second half it was played similarly to the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated version , with five questions worth from 1,000 to 5,000 dawson showed himself to have insistent affections for all of the female members of each family that competed on the show , regardless of age combs hosted the program until the daytime version 's cancellation in 1993 and the syndicated version until the end of the 1993–94 season dawson returned to the show at the request of mark goodson productions for the 1994–95 season when feud returned to syndication in 1999 , it was initially hosted by louie anderson , with burton richardson as the new announcer like many other game shows at the time , the nighttime feud aired once a week ;

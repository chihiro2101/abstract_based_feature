two family teams of five contestants ( reduced to four contestants for the 1994–95 season ) each compete to win cash and prizes the original version of the show began with the families being introduced , seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits , after which the host interviewed them the minimum age to participate in family feud is 15 , although every family must have at least one person who is 18 years or older each round begins with a '' face-off '' question that serves as a toss-up between two opposing contestants the host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people , e.g a certain number of answers are concealed on the board , ranked by popularity of the survey 's responses the first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer ; if it is the most popular , his/her family immediately wins the face-off the family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers , with each member giving one answer in sequence giving an answer not on the board , or failing to respond within the allotted time , earns one strike for most of the series , this is done after the family confers with each other ; the only exception was on the 1988 series where each family member was polled for an answer with the team captain having the option to either select one of the family 's answers or give a different answer the winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question , including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal ( if applicable ) for most of the show 's existence , the first team to reach or surpass a certain point total won the game when the original series first premiered , the goal was 200 points and for its final year , it was increased to 400 points the only time a goal was not used was for the first four years of the 1999 syndicated series , where the highest scoring family after four rounds , the last of which was played for triple points and used only one strike , was declared the winner in the original periodic primetime specials , three games were played , with the first two using the original scoring system for game 3 , just one question round was done , with the winning two celebrity teams from the previous rounds playing one contestant is onstage with the host , while the other is sequestered backstage with headphones so that they can not see or hear the first portion of the round the clock begins to run only after the first question is asked , and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked , if time remains the grand prize for syndicated episodes was 10,000 for much of its existence when family feud premiered on abc , network rules dictated how much a family could win the cbs daytime and syndicated versions which began airing in 1988 also featured returning champions , who could appear for a maximum of five days for these episodes , two new families competed in this first half of each episode the second half featured former champion families who appeared on family feud between 1977 and 1985 , with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half in june 1992 , the cbs daytime edition of feud expanded from 30 to 60 minutes and became known as the family feud challenge each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it when richard dawson returned as host of the program in 1994 , the round 's name was changed to the '' bankroll '' round the initial stake for each family remained the same ( 2,500 in the first half of the hour and 5,000 in the second ) incensed , dawson sent his agent to goodson to threaten an un-funny , silent , and bland dawson on future match game episodes if dawson was not given an audition for feud thus , the original abc and first syndicated versions of family feud were hosted by dawson combs hosted the program until the daytime version 's cancellation in 1993 and the syndicated version until the end of the 1993–94 season dawson returned to the show at the request of mark goodson productions for the 1994–95 season when feud returned to syndication in 1999 , it was initially hosted by louie anderson , with burton richardson as the new announcer the first four versions of the show were directed by paul alter and produced by howard felsher and cathy dawson mark goodson created family feud during the increasing popularity of his earlier game show , match game , which set daytime ratings records in 1976 , and on which dawson was appearing as one of its most popular panelists the show , along with a revised daytime schedule for the summer , was first announced by abc at an annual meeting in may from may 8 , 1978 until may 25 , 1984 , abc periodically broadcast hour-long primetime '' all-star specials '' , in which celebrity casts from various primetime lineup tv series competed instead of ordinary families like many other game shows at the time , the nighttime feud aired once a week ;

lotze was born in bautzen ( budziszyn ) , saxony , germany , the son of a physician he was educated at the grammar school of zittau ; he had an enduring love of the classical authors , publishing a translation of sophocles ' antigone into latin verse in his middle life he attended the university of leipzig as a student of philosophy and natural sciences , but entered officially as a student of medicine when he was seventeen lotze 's early studies were mostly governed by two distinct interests : the first was scientific , based upon mathematical and physical studies under the guidance of e rudolf hermann lotze ( 1817–1881 ) frederick beiser , late german idealism : trendelenburg and lotze , oxford university press , 2013 , p weisse also influenced his later anti-psychologistic approach lotze expressed these views in his 1880 article '' die philosophie in den letzten 40 jahren '' / '' philosophy in the last forty years '' ( kleine schriften , v lotze 's first work was his dissertation de futurae biologiae principibus philosophicis , with which he gained in july 1838 the degree of doctor of medicine in 1840 he gained the degree of doctor of philosophy with his dissertation de summis continuorum he first became known to a larger circle through a series of works which aimed at establishing the study of both the physical and mental phenomena of the human organism , 1848 ) , the articles '' lebenskraft '' ( 1843 ) and '' seele und seelenleben '' ( 1846 ) in rudolf wagner 's handwörterbuch der physiologie , his allgemeine physiologie des körperlichen lebens ( 1851 ) , and his medizinische psychologie oder physiologie der seele ( 1852 ) when lotze published these works , medical science was still under the influence of schelling 's philosophy of nature the mechanical laws , to which external things were subject , were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world mechanism was the unalterable connexion of every phenomenon a with other phenomena b , c , d , either as following or preceding it ; mechanism was the inexorable form into which the events of this world are cast , and by which they are connected published as they were during the years when the modern school of german materialism was at its height , these works of lotze were enrolled in the opposing camp of empiricism lotze worked in a post-revolutionary time of transition between the idealistic and rationalist legacies of leibniz , kant and hegel and the new materialism and scientific interpretation of reality he believed that everywhere in the wide realm of observation we find three distinct regions : the region of facts , the region of laws and the region of standards of value full understanding comes through conviction that the world of facts is the field in which those higher standards of moral and aesthetic value are being realized through the medium of laws such a union is , for him , only intelligible through the idea of a personal deity , who in the creation and preservation of a world has voluntarily chosen certain forms and laws , through the natural operation of which the ends of his work are gained in these lectures he expounded his peculiar views in a stricter form , and during the last decade of his life he embodied the substance of those courses in his system der philosophie , of which only two volumes have appeared ( vol a problem of a purely formal character for him was to try to bring unity and harmony into the scattered thoughts of our general culture his goal was to form some general idea how laws , facts and standards of value may be combined in one comprehensive view the world of many things surrounds us ; our notions , by which we manage correctly or incorrectly to describe it , are also ready made and the nature of this reality again can neither be consistently represented as a fixed and hard substance nor as an unalterable something , but only as a fixed order of recurrence of continually changing events or impressions these manifestations of the divine spirit again can not be traced and understood by reducing ( as hegel did ) the growth of the human mind in the individual , in society and in history to the monotonous rhythm of a speculative schematism google ( oxford ) google ( stanford ) google ( uwisc ) volume 2 , 1886 google ( oxford ) ia ( state central ) ia ( utoronto ) 2nd ed

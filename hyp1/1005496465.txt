lotze was born in bautzen ( budziszyn ) , saxony , germany , the son of a physician he was educated at the grammar school of zittau ; he had an enduring love of the classical authors , publishing a translation of sophocles ' antigone into latin verse in his middle life he attended the university of leipzig as a student of philosophy and natural sciences , but entered officially as a student of medicine when he was seventeen lotze 's early studies were mostly governed by two distinct interests : the first was scientific , based upon mathematical and physical studies under the guidance of e rudolf hermann lotze ( 1817–1881 ) frederick beiser , late german idealism : trendelenburg and lotze , oxford university press , 2013 , p he was attracted both by science and by the german idealism of johann gottlieb fichte , friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel in 1840 he gained the degree of doctor of philosophy with his dissertation de summis continuorum he first became known to a larger circle through a series of works which aimed at establishing the study of both the physical and mental phenomena of the human organism these later works considered the human organism in its normal and diseased states when lotze published these works , medical science was still under the influence of schelling 's philosophy of nature the mechanical laws , to which external things were subject , were conceived as being valid only in the inorganic world in the last of the above-mentioned works the question is discussed at great length how we have to consider mind , and the relation between mind and body ; the answer is we have to consider mind as an immaterial principle , its action , however , on the body and vice versa as purely mechanical , indicated by the fixed laws of a psycho-physical mechanism published as they were during the years when the modern school of german materialism was at its height , these works of lotze were enrolled in the opposing camp of empiricism however , he admitted that the monadology of leibniz could be considered the forerunner of herbart 's teachings and also of his own views full understanding comes through conviction that the world of facts is the field in which those higher standards of moral and aesthetic value are being realized through the medium of laws the third and concluding volume , which was to treat in a more condensed form the principal problems of practical philosophy , of philosophy of art and religion , was not completed before his death a problem of a purely formal character for him was to try to bring unity and harmony into the scattered thoughts of our general culture his goal was to form some general idea how laws , facts and standards of value may be combined in one comprehensive view the world of many things surrounds us ; our notions , by which we manage correctly or incorrectly to describe it , are also ready made the course of things and their connexion is only thinkable by the assumption of a plurality of existences , the reality of which ( as distinguished from our knowledge of them ) can be conceived only as a multitude of relations the things themselves which exist and their changing phases must stand in some internal connexion ; they themselves must be active or passive , capable of doing or suffering lotze can be said to have brought philosophy out of the lecture-room into the market-place of life google ( oxford ) google ( umich ) google ( uwisc ) google ( oxford ) ia ( state central ) ia ( utoronto ) 2nd ed google ( harvard ) ia ( st rudolf hermann lotze ( 1817–1881 ) entry by nikolay milkov in the internet encyclopedia of philosophy

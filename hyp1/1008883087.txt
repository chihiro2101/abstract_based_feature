we recognized the crater as the likely cretaceous-paleogene boundary event although penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets , he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact this layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology penfield tried to secure site samples , but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed at the same time , in 1980 , geologist walter alvarez and his father , nobel prize–winning scientist luis walter alvarez , put forth their hypothesis that a large extraterrestrial body had struck earth at the time of the cretaceous–paleogene boundary in 1981 , unaware of penfield 's discovery , university of arizona graduate student alan r thick , jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present , thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an earth impact such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the caribbean basin at the k–pg boundary hildebrand interview : 'similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of north america … indicate that something extraordinary happened here ' so when haitian professor florentine morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on haiti , hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact tests on samples retrieved from the k–pg boundary revealed more tektite glass , formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear weapon in 1990 , houston chronicle reporter carlos byars told hildebrand of penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater researchers at the university of glasgow dated tektite samples from the impact as 66,038,000 ± 11,000 & nbsp ; years old the impact created a hole wide and deep , leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by of sediment by the 21st century the height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact ; in deep ocean it would have been tall a cloud of hot dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second '' fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in new jersey away from the impact site , indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land field research from the hell creek formation in north dakota published in 2019 shows the simultaneous mass extinction of myriad species combined with geological and atmospheric features consistent with the impact event according to researchers , the impact triggered a seismic event equivalent to a magnitude 12 earthquake at the impact site , with shockwaves generating the equivalent of magnitude 9 earthquakes across the globe the emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the earth for several years , possibly a decade , creating a harsh environment for living things production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect in february 2008 , a team of researchers led by sean gulick at the university of texas at austin 's jackson school of geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed a long-term local effect of the impact was the creation of the yucatán sedimentary basin which '' ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce the k–pg boundary inside the feature is depressed to compared with the normal depth of about measured away from the impact feature the paper also noted that the crater seemed to be a good candidate source for the tektites reported at haiti it was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the earth 's surface among other material thrown up by the impact , producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay chicxulub is the only known earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring , but it is under of sediment during expedition 364 , des drillers on the l/b myrtle collected core samples to enable ecord science party members to study how the peak ring formed and calculate the total impact energy chicxulub and the exploration of large peak-ring impact craters through scientific drilling ( pdf ) the granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite , a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact probing the impact-generated hydrothermal system in the peak ring of the chicxulub crater and its potential as a habitat

image : chicxulub-anomaly.jpg thumb gravity anomaly map of the chicxulub impact area a ring of cenotes is associated with the largest semicircular feature , although its exact origin remains unclear in 1978 , geophysicists glen penfield and antonio camargo were working for the mexican state-owned oil company pemex , or pemex , as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the gulf of mexico north of the yucatán peninsula in the offshore magnetic data , penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated , and mapped 2 pencil mapping of the offshore magnetic anomalies , the fit was perfect : a shallow , 180-kilometer diameter gravity-magnetic bullseye on the almost non-magnetic , uniform carbonate background of the yucatan platform ! we recognized the crater as the likely cretaceous-paleogene boundary event '' a decade earlier , the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor robert baltosser , but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by pemex corporate policy of the time coincidentally , many experts in impact craters and the cretaceous–paleogene boundary were attending a separate conference on earth impacts although penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets , he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact this layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology at the same time , in 1980 , geologist walter alvarez and his father , nobel prize–winning scientist luis walter alvarez , put forth their hypothesis that a large extraterrestrial body had struck earth at the time of the cretaceous–paleogene boundary their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites thick , jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present , thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an earth impact such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the caribbean basin at the k–pg boundary tests on samples retrieved from the k–pg boundary revealed more tektite glass , formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear weapon in 1990 , houston chronicle reporter carlos byars told hildebrand of penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater more recent evidence suggests the crater is wide , and the 180 & nbsp ; km ring is an inner wall of it researchers at the university of glasgow dated tektite samples from the impact as 66,038,000 ± 11,000 & nbsp ; years old the height of the tsunami was limited by the relatively shallow sea in the area of the impact ; in deep ocean it would have been tall a cloud of hot dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second according to researchers , the impact triggered a seismic event equivalent to a magnitude 12 earthquake at the impact site , with shockwaves generating the equivalent of magnitude 9 earthquakes across the globe in addition , the ensuing shockwaves likely triggered large-scale volcanic eruptions across the earth ; the shockwaves probably contributed to the deccan traps flood basalt eruption , which was estimated to have occurred around the same time over a decade or longer , sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere , cooling the surface dramatically in february 2008 , a team of researchers led by sean gulick at the university of texas at austin 's jackson school of geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed image : iridium clay layer.png thumb right the piece of clay , held by walter alvarez , that sparked research into the impact theory in their 1991 paper , hildebrand , penfield and company described the geology and composition of the impact feature the rocks above the impact feature are layers of marl and limestone reaching to a depth of almost these andesitic igneous rocks were only found within the supposed impact feature , as is shocked quartz the k–pg boundary inside the feature is depressed to compared with the normal depth of about measured away from the impact feature along the edge of the crater are clusters of cenotes or sinkholes , which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the neogene period , after the impact luis and walter alvarez , at the time both faculty members at the university of california , berkeley , postulated that this enormous extinction event , which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the chicxulub crater , could have been caused by just such a large impact iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared with 0.4 for the earth 's crust as a whole ; web elements in recent years , several other craters of around the same age as chicxulub have been discovered , all between latitudes 20°n and 70°n examples include the disputed silverpit crater in the north sea , and the boltysh crater in ukraine chicxulub is the only known earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring , but it is under of sediment

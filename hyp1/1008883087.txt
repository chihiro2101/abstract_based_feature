years old '' fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in new jersey away from the impact site , indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land field research from the hell creek formation in north dakota published in 2019 shows the simultaneous mass extinction of myriad species combined with geological and atmospheric features consistent with the impact event according to researchers , the impact triggered a seismic event equivalent to a magnitude 12 earthquake at the impact site , with shockwaves generating the equivalent of magnitude 9 earthquakes across the globe in addition , the ensuing shockwaves likely triggered large-scale volcanic eruptions across the earth ; the shockwaves probably contributed to the deccan traps flood basalt eruption , which was estimated to have occurred around the same time production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect over a decade or longer , sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere , cooling the surface dramatically '' this was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring ( the rocks found were from deep within the earth 's crust instead ) , the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere image : iridium clay layer.png thumb right the piece of clay , held by walter alvarez , that sparked research into the impact theory along the edge of the crater are clusters of cenotes or sinkholes , which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the neogene period , after the impact bottke , david vokrouhlický , and david nesvorný , argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the baptistina family of asteroids , the largest surviving member of which is 298 baptistina the connection between chicxulub and baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor , suggesting the impactor was a member of an uncommon class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites , like baptistina in february 2021 , scientists reported studies suggesting the impactor that led to the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago was a fragment from a disrupted comet , rather than an asteroid which has long been the leading candidate among scientists the exact mechanism of the site 's destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused tsunami or lake and river seiche activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes ; there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled both are much smaller than chicxulub , but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the earth another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger shiva crater , though the structure 's status as an impact crater is contested chicxulub is the only known earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring , but it is under of sediment it suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust , causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings

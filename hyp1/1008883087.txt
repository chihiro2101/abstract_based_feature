years old the chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of , and delivered an estimated energy of 21–921 & nbsp ; billion hiroshima a-bombs ( between 1.3×10 and 5.8×10 & nbsp ; joules , or 1.3–58 & nbsp ; yotta- ) the impact would have caused a megatsunami over tall that would have reached all the way to what are now texas and florida nonetheless , the most recent simulations show that waves may have been up to 1.5 kilometers ( ~1 & nbsp ; mi ) tall , able to reach the coastal lines all over the world a cloud of hot dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second '' fossil evidence for an instantaneous die-off of diverse animals was found in a soil layer only thick in new jersey away from the impact site , indicating that death and burial under debris occurred suddenly and quickly over wide distances on land field research from the hell creek formation in north dakota published in 2019 shows the simultaneous mass extinction of myriad species combined with geological and atmospheric features consistent with the impact event in addition , the ensuing shockwaves likely triggered large-scale volcanic eruptions across the earth ; the shockwaves probably contributed to the deccan traps flood basalt eruption , which was estimated to have occurred around the same time the emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the earth for several years , possibly a decade , creating a harsh environment for living things in february 2008 , a team of researchers led by sean gulick at the university of texas at austin 's jackson school of geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed these andesitic igneous rocks were only found within the supposed impact feature , as is shocked quartz the k–pg boundary inside the feature is depressed to compared with the normal depth of about measured away from the impact feature along the edge of the crater are clusters of cenotes or sinkholes , which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the neogene period , after the impact the connection between chicxulub and baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor , suggesting the impactor was a member of an uncommon class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites , like baptistina the chicxulub crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late physicist luis alvarez and his son , geologist walter alvarez , that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups , including non-avian dinosaurs , may have resulted from a bolide impact ( the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event ) examples include the disputed silverpit crater in the north sea , and the boltysh crater in ukraine chicxulub is the only known earth crater with a remaining impact peak ring , but it is under of sediment the granite samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal granite , a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact also related to this tsunami was a dense dinosaur bone bed on the cretaceous–paleogene boundary found in patagonia

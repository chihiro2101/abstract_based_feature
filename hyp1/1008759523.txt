the name '' nickelodeon '' was first used in 1888 by colonel william austin for his austin 's nickelodeon , a dime museum located in boston , massachusetts although it was not the first theater to show films , in 1919 a news article stated that it was the first theater in the world '' devoted exclusively to exhibition of moving picture spectacles '' davis and harris found such great success with their operation that their concept of a five-cent theater showing movies continuously was soon imitated by hundreds of ambitious entrepreneurs , as was the name of the theater itself mayer came of age just as the popularity of the nickelodeon was beginning to rise ; he renovated the gem theater in haverhill , massachusetts , converting it into a nickelodeon , which he opened in 1907 as the orpheum theater , announcing that it would be '' the home of refined entertainment devoted to miles brothers moving pictures and illustrated songs '' around 1903 , longer multi-shot films became more prevalent , and this shift brought about important innovations in the distribution of films with the establishment of '' film exchanges '' while some nickelodeons only showed films , others offered shows that combined films with vaudeville acts or illustrated songs longer films were also more attractive , as the price paid by exhibitors depended on a film 's length and the longer a film , the more profit there was to be made some exhibitors found longer films more desirable since it made programming easier , faster , and possibly cheaper , as they no longer had to organize their own programs by editing together a variety of short films one of the possible reasons for this shift is that fiction films were often easier to plan and cheaper to film than actualities which were subject to various location-related difficulties nickelodeons further declined with the advent of the feature film , and as cities grew and industry consolidation led to larger , more comfortable , better-appointed movie theaters the growth of longer films , which nickelodeons played a large part in stimulating , also led to the development of intertitles , which appeared in 1903 and helped make actions and scenes clearer as storylines became more complicated a side-effect of this change was that it minimized the role of exhibitors , since they no longer had the editorial control of organizing single-shot films into programs , and now their narrative responsibility ( some exhibitors would talk and help explain narratives as they unfolded ) was also minimized by this '' internal narration '' in the film

the name '' nickelodeon '' was first used in 1888 by colonel william austin for his austin 's nickelodeon , a dime museum located in boston , massachusetts although it was not the first theater to show films , in 1919 a news article stated that it was the first theater in the world '' devoted exclusively to exhibition of moving picture spectacles '' mayer came of age just as the popularity of the nickelodeon was beginning to rise ; he renovated the gem theater in haverhill , massachusetts , converting it into a nickelodeon , which he opened in 1907 as the orpheum theater , announcing that it would be '' the home of refined entertainment devoted to miles brothers moving pictures and illustrated songs '' around 1903 , longer multi-shot films became more prevalent , and this shift brought about important innovations in the distribution of films with the establishment of '' film exchanges '' while some nickelodeons only showed films , others offered shows that combined films with vaudeville acts or illustrated songs economic competition between film production companies put pressure on them to create more elaborate , and often longer , films , to differentiate one film from another longer films were also more attractive , as the price paid by exhibitors depended on a film 's length and the longer a film , the more profit there was to be made the popularity of longer films also meant an increase in production of fictional films as actualities decreased one of the possible reasons for this shift is that fiction films were often easier to plan and cheaper to film than actualities which were subject to various location-related difficulties fiction films quickly became standardized , and the popularity of longer films meant they outperformed actualities , which were usually short nickelodeons further declined with the advent of the feature film , and as cities grew and industry consolidation led to larger , more comfortable , better-appointed movie theaters the growth of longer films , which nickelodeons played a large part in stimulating , also led to the development of intertitles , which appeared in 1903 and helped make actions and scenes clearer as storylines became more complicated

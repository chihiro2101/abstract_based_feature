a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years 40 & nbsp ; mg/kg ) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use , with no individual limit greater than 10 & nbsp ; ppm in this monograph , the limit of total pesticides was reduced to 3 & nbsp ; ppm total pesticides , with no individual limit greater than 1 & nbsp ; ppm new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin these ultra-high-purity grades of lanolin are ideally suited to the treatment of dermatological disorders such as eczema and on open wounds lanolin applied to the skin at 2 & nbsp ; mg/cm 2 has been shown to reduce roughness by about 35 % after one hour and 50 % after two hours , with the overall effect lasting for considerably more than eight hours however , allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging from rustproof coatings to lubricants lanolin is also used in lip balm products such as carmex

a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin â€™ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids the use of ahas in skin care products has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years 40 & nbsp ; mg/kg ) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use , with no individual limit greater than 10 & nbsp ; ppm new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin a study carried out at new york university hospital in the early 1950s had shown about 1 % of patients with dermatological disorders were allergic to the lanolin being used at that time the cosmetics directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products ; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions polarized light microscopy has shown the lamellar vesicles formed by lanolin are identical to those formed by human stratum corneum lipids lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging from rustproof coatings to lubricants lanolin is used as a primary lubricating component in aerosol-based brass lubricants in the ammunition reloading process lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool

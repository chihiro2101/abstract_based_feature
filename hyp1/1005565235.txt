a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin ’ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years in addition to general purity requirements , lanolin must meet official requirements for the permissible levels of pesticide residues 40 & nbsp ; mg/kg ) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use , with no individual limit greater than 10 & nbsp ; ppm thumb lanolin and its many derivatives are used extensively in both the personal care ( e.g lanocote ) containing up to 85 % lanolin are used to prevent corrosion in marine fasteners , especially when two different metals are in contact with each other and saltwater 7-dehydrocholesterol from lanolin is used as a raw material for producing cholecalciferol by irradiation with ultraviolet light the wool from one merino sheep will produce about 250–300 & nbsp ; ml of recoverable wool grease lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool

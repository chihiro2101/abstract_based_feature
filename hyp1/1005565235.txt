a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin ’ s complex composition of long-chain esters , hydroxyesters , diesters , lanolin alcohols , and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right , it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives , which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years the use of ahas in skin care products has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years 40 & nbsp ; mg/kg ) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use , with no individual limit greater than 10 & nbsp ; ppm lanolin conforming to this monograph is intended for use in more exacting applications , for example on open wounds new products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state , removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white , odourless , hypoallergenic lanolin the cosmetics directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products ; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions lanolin applied to the skin at 2 & nbsp ; mg/cm 2 has been shown to reduce roughness by about 35 % after one hour and 50 % after two hours , with the overall effect lasting for considerably more than eight hours the wool from one merino sheep will produce about 250–300 & nbsp ; ml of recoverable wool grease lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool

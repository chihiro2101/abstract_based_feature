a typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of long chain waxy esters ( approximately 97 % by weight ) with the remainder being lanolin alcohols , lanolin acids and lanolin hydrocarbons an estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin , resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and dermatology products hydrolysis of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids lanolin alcohols are a rich source of cholesterol ( an important skin lipid ) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers ; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years a study carried out at new york university hospital in the early 1950s had shown about 1 % of patients with dermatological disorders were allergic to the lanolin being used at that time despite only being in force for a short period of time , this ruling did harm both to the lanolin industry and to the reputation of lanolin in general skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the emollient ( skin smoothing ) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours however , allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use it is frequently used in protective baby skin treatment and for sore nipples in breastfeeding mothers lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging from rustproof coatings to lubricants crude lanolin constitutes about 5â€“25 % of the weight of freshly shorn wool lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt , wool grease ( crude lanolin ) , suint ( sweat salts ) , and anything else stuck to the wool

the africanized honey bees in the western hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist warwick e kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america according to kerr , in october & nbsp ; 1957 a visiting beekeeper , noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees ' movement , removed them , resulting in the accidental release of 26 & nbsp ; tanganyikan swarms of a following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies the descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the americas , moving through the amazon basin in the 1970s , crossing into central america in 1982 , and reaching mexico in 1985 because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species the prospect of killer bees arriving in the united states caused a media sensation in the late 1970s , inspired several horror movies , and sparked debate about the wisdom of humans altering entire ecosystems africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees africanized honey bees are considered an invasive species in the americas their expansion stopped for a time at eastern texas , possibly due to the large population of european honey bee hives in the area in october & nbsp ; 2010 , a 73-year-old man was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees while clearing brush on his south georgia property , as determined by georgia 's department of agriculture in june & nbsp ; 2013 , 62-year-old larry goodwin of moody , texas was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees in tropical climates they effectively out-compete european honey bees and , at their peak rate of expansion , they spread north at almost two kilometers ( about one mile ) a day as the africanized honey bee migrates further north , colonies continue to interbreed with european honey bees in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america thus africanized honey bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the southern states of the united states , reaching as far north as the chesapeake bay in the east the reduced available winter forage in northern california means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other the honey production from a single hive of africanized honey bees can be 100 & nbsp ; kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3â€“5 & nbsp ; kg of the various melipona stingless bee species thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the africanized honey bee africanized honey bees begin foraging at young ages and harvest a greater quantity of pollen with respect to their european counterparts ( apis mellifera ligustica ) africanized honey bees are also sensitive to sucrose at lower concentrations scutellata and italian bee published by fewell and bertram in 2002 suggests that the differential evolution of this suite of behaviors is due to the different environmental pressures experienced by african and european subspecies although the native east african lowland honey bees ( apis mellifera scutellata ) are smaller and build smaller comb cells than the european honey bees , their hybrids are not smaller according to the scientists who analyzed its genetic code , the western honey bee originated in africa and spread to eurasia in two ancient migrations the most common way that a european honey bee hive will become africanized is through crossbreeding during a new queen 's mating flight in areas of suitable temperate climate , the survival traits of africanized honey bee colonies help them outperform european honey bee colonies and one of the main reasons why central and south american beekeepers have had to learn to manage and work with the existing africanized honey bee the africanized honey bee is considered the honey bee of choice for beekeeping in brazil

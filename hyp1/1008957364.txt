there are 29 & nbsp ; recognized subspecies of apis mellifera based largely on geographic variations the africanized honey bees in the western hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist warwick e kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america these hives had been fitted with special excluder screens ( called queen excluders ) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of european bees according to kerr , in october & nbsp ; 1957 a visiting beekeeper , noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees ' movement , removed them , resulting in the accidental release of 26 & nbsp ; tanganyikan swarms of a following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies the descendants of these colonies have since spread throughout the americas , moving through the amazon basin in the 1970s , crossing into central america in 1982 , and reaching mexico in 1985 because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species the prospect of killer bees arriving in the united states caused a media sensation in the late 1970s , inspired several horror movies , and sparked debate about the wisdom of humans altering entire ecosystems the first africanized honey bees in the u.s in the tucson region of arizona , a study of trapped swarms in 1994 found that only 15 & nbsp ; percent had been africanized ; this number had grown to 90 & nbsp ; percent by 1997 africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees as of 2002 , the africanized honey bees had spread from brazil south to northern argentina and north to central america , trinidad ( the west indies ) , mexico , texas , arizona , nevada , new mexico , florida , and southern california their expansion stopped for a time at eastern texas , possibly due to the large population of european honey bee hives in the area in february & nbsp ; 2009 , africanized honey bees were found in southern utah in may & nbsp ; 2014 , colorado state university confirmed that bees from a swarm which had aggressively attacked an orchardist near palisade , in west-central colorado , were from an africanized honey bee hive in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen african honey bees abscond ( abandon the hive and any food store to start over in a new location ) more readily than european honeybees the cold-weather limits of the africanized honey bee have driven some professional bee breeders from southern california into the harsher wintering locales of the northern sierra nevada and southern cascade range the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other the honey production from a single hive of africanized honey bees can be 100 & nbsp ; kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3â€“5 & nbsp ; kg of the various melipona stingless bee species thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the africanized honey bee africanized honey bees begin foraging at young ages and harvest a greater quantity of pollen with respect to their european counterparts ( apis mellifera ligustica ) this may be linked to the high reproductive rate of the africanized honey bee which requires pollen to feed the greater number of larvae scutellata and italian bee published by fewell and bertram in 2002 suggests that the differential evolution of this suite of behaviors is due to the different environmental pressures experienced by african and european subspecies the differences in a variety of behaviors between different species of honey bees are the result of a directional selection that acts upon several foraging behavior traits as a common entity natural selection is able to directly shift the set of foraging behaviors by operating on the distribution of these genes in the honey bee population ( pankiw , 2003 ) the most common way that a european honey bee hive will become africanized is through crossbreeding during a new queen 's mating flight studies show that in areas of florida that contain africanized honey bees , the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live the africanized honey bee is considered the honey bee of choice for beekeeping in brazil

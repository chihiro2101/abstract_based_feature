kerr , who had interbred honey bees from europe and southern africa kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america these hives had been fitted with special excluder screens ( called queen excluders ) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of european bees following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species the first africanized honey bees in the u.s africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees have greater defensiveness when in a resting swarm , compared to other honey bee types guard the hive aggressively , with a larger alarm zone around the hive africanized honey bees are considered an invasive species in the americas on 11 & nbsp ; september 2007 , commissioner bob odom of the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry said that africanized honey bees had established themselves in the new orleans area in february & nbsp ; 2009 , africanized honey bees were found in southern utah in june & nbsp ; 2013 , 62-year-old larry goodwin of moody , texas was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees as the africanized honey bee migrates further north , colonies continue to interbreed with european honey bees in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen african honey bees abscond ( abandon the hive and any food store to start over in a new location ) more readily than european honeybees thus africanized honey bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the southern states of the united states , reaching as far north as the chesapeake bay in the east the cold-weather limits of the africanized honey bee have driven some professional bee breeders from southern california into the harsher wintering locales of the northern sierra nevada and southern cascade range the arrival of the africanized honey bee in central america is threatening the ancient art of keeping melipona stingless bees in log gums , although they do not interbreed or directly compete with each other the honey production from a single hive of africanized honey bees can be 100 & nbsp ; kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3â€“5 & nbsp ; kg of the various melipona stingless bee species whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown , but they are well adapted to exist in the wild , and there are a number of indigenous plants that the africanized honey bees do not visit , so their fate remains to be seen africanized honey bees begin foraging at young ages and harvest a greater quantity of pollen with respect to their european counterparts ( apis mellifera ligustica ) this may be linked to the high reproductive rate of the africanized honey bee which requires pollen to feed the greater number of larvae africanized honey bees are also sensitive to sucrose at lower concentrations the noted per to low sucrose concentration in africanized honey bees may be a result of selective pressure in times of scarcity when their survival depends on their attraction to low quality resources there are two lineages of the east african lowland subspecies ( apis mellifera scutellata ) in the americas : actual matrilineal descendants of the original escaped queens and a much smaller number that are africanized through hybridization the most common way that a european honey bee hive will become africanized is through crossbreeding during a new queen 's mating flight in areas of suitable temperate climate , the survival traits of africanized honey bee colonies help them outperform european honey bee colonies studies show that in areas of florida that contain africanized honey bees , the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live this is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the european honey bee , although they also contain africanized honey bee material

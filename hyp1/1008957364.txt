there are 29 & nbsp ; recognized subspecies of apis mellifera based largely on geographic variations the africanized honey bees in the western hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist warwick e kerr , who had interbred honey bees from europe and southern africa kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america these hives had been fitted with special excluder screens ( called queen excluders ) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of european bees following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species the first africanized honey bees in the u.s bee experts theorized the colony had not traveled overland but instead '' arrived hidden in a load of oil-drilling pipe shipped from south america '' the first permanent colonies arrived in texas from mexico in 1990 africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees as of 2002 , the africanized honey bees had spread from brazil south to northern argentina and north to central america , trinidad ( the west indies ) , mexico , texas , arizona , nevada , new mexico , florida , and southern california on 11 & nbsp ; september 2007 , commissioner bob odom of the louisiana department of agriculture and forestry said that africanized honey bees had established themselves in the new orleans area in february & nbsp ; 2009 , africanized honey bees were found in southern utah in june & nbsp ; 2013 , 62-year-old larry goodwin of moody , texas was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees there were discussions about slowing the spread by placing large numbers of docile european-strain hives in strategic locations , particularly at the isthmus of panama , but various national and international agricultural departments could not prevent the bees ' expansion as the africanized honey bee migrates further north , colonies continue to interbreed with european honey bees in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america the honey production from a single hive of africanized honey bees can be 100 & nbsp ; kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3â€“5 & nbsp ; kg of the various melipona stingless bee species thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the africanized honey bee africanized honey bees have a set of characteristics with respect to foraging behavior africanized honey bees begin foraging at young ages and harvest a greater quantity of pollen with respect to their european counterparts ( apis mellifera ligustica ) honey bee sensitivity to different concentrations of sucrose is determined by a reflex known as the proboscis extension response or per the differences in resources emphasized during harvesting are a result of the european honey bee 's sensitivity to sucrose at higher concentrations when resource density is low in africanized honey bee habitats , it is necessary for the bees to harvest a greater variety of resources because they can not afford to be selective although the native east african lowland honey bees ( apis mellifera scutellata ) are smaller and build smaller comb cells than the european honey bees , their hybrids are not smaller mellifera lineages , though mtdna only allows one to detect africanized colonies that have africanized queens and not colonies where a european queen has mated with africanized drones not all africanized honey bee hives display the typical hyper-defensive behavior , which may provide bee breeders a point to begin breeding a gentler stock ( gahbs ) the africanized honey bee is considered the honey bee of choice for beekeeping in brazil

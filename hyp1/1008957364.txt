there are 29 & nbsp ; recognized subspecies of apis mellifera based largely on geographic variations the africanized honey bees in the western hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist warwick e kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america these hives had been fitted with special excluder screens ( called queen excluders ) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of european bees according to kerr , in october & nbsp ; 1957 a visiting beekeeper , noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees ' movement , removed them , resulting in the accidental release of 26 & nbsp ; tanganyikan swarms of a following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species the first africanized honey bees in the u.s '' the first permanent colonies arrived in texas from mexico in 1990 africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees have greater defensiveness when in a resting swarm , compared to other honey bee types however , discoveries of the africanized honey bees in southern louisiana show that they have gotten past this barrier , or have come as a swarm aboard a ship in february & nbsp ; 2009 , africanized honey bees were found in southern utah in june & nbsp ; 2013 , 62-year-old larry goodwin of moody , texas was killed by a swarm of africanized honey bees in may & nbsp ; 2014 , colorado state university confirmed that bees from a swarm which had aggressively attacked an orchardist near palisade , in west-central colorado , were from an africanized honey bee hive in tropical climates they effectively out-compete european honey bees and , at their peak rate of expansion , they spread north at almost two kilometers ( about one mile ) a day as the africanized honey bee migrates further north , colonies continue to interbreed with european honey bees in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen there are now relatively stable geographic zones in which either africanized honey bees dominate , a mix of africanized and european honey bees is present , or only non-africanized honey bees are found , as in the southern portions of south america or northern north america thus africanized honey bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the southern states of the united states , reaching as far north as the chesapeake bay in the east the cold-weather limits of the africanized honey bee have driven some professional bee breeders from southern california into the harsher wintering locales of the northern sierra nevada and southern cascade range thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the africanized honey bee scutellata and italian bee published by fewell and bertram in 2002 suggests that the differential evolution of this suite of behaviors is due to the different environmental pressures experienced by african and european subspecies honey bee sensitivity to different concentrations of sucrose is determined by a reflex known as the proboscis extension response or per for example , european honey bees ( apis mellifera ligustica ) forage at older ages and harvest less pollen and more concentrated nectar the differences in a variety of behaviors between different species of honey bees are the result of a directional selection that acts upon several foraging behavior traits as a common entity the popular term '' killer bee '' has only limited scientific meaning today because there is no generally accepted fraction of genetic contribution used to establish a cut-off africanized honey bees have slightly shorter wings , which can only be recognized reliably by performing a statistical analysis on micro-measurements of a substantial sample while studies have shown that africanized honey bees can infiltrate european honey bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen ( thus usurping the hive ) , this is less common than other methods the africanized honey bee is considered the honey bee of choice for beekeeping in brazil

there are 29 & nbsp ; recognized subspecies of apis mellifera based largely on geographic variations the africanized honey bees in the western hemisphere are descended from hives operated by biologist warwick e kerr , who had interbred honey bees from europe and southern africa kerr was attempting to breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey in tropics conditions than the european strain of honey bee currently in use throughout north , central and south america these hives had been fitted with special excluder screens ( called queen excluders ) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of european bees according to kerr , in october & nbsp ; 1957 a visiting beekeeper , noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees ' movement , removed them , resulting in the accidental release of 26 & nbsp ; tanganyikan swarms of a following this accidental release , the africanized honey bee swarms spread out and crossbred with local european honey bee colonies because their movement through these regions was rapid and largely unassisted by humans , africanized honey bees have earned the reputation of being a notorious invasive species the first africanized honey bees in the u.s in the tucson region of arizona , a study of trapped swarms in 1994 found that only 15 & nbsp ; percent had been africanized ; this number had grown to 90 & nbsp ; percent by 1997 africanized honey bees , as opposed to other western bee types : tend to swarm more frequently and go farther than other types of honey bees deploy in greater numbers for defense and pursues perceived threats over much longer distances from the hive however , discoveries of the africanized honey bees in southern louisiana show that they have gotten past this barrier , or have come as a swarm aboard a ship as the africanized honey bee migrates further north , colonies continue to interbreed with european honey bees in a study conducted in arizona in 2004 it was observed that swarms of africanized honey bees could take over weakened european honey bee hives by invading the hive , then killing the european queen and establishing their own queen african honey bees abscond ( abandon the hive and any food store to start over in a new location ) more readily than european honeybees thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional stingless bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the africanized honey bee africanized honey bees have a set of characteristics with respect to foraging behavior africanized honey bees begin foraging at young ages and harvest a greater quantity of pollen with respect to their european counterparts ( apis mellifera ligustica ) different species of honey bees that employ different foraging behaviors will vary in the concentration of sucrose that elicits their proboscis extension response the differences in a variety of behaviors between different species of honey bees are the result of a directional selection that acts upon several foraging behavior traits as a common entity selection in natural populations of honey bees show that positive selection of sensitivity to low concentrations of sucrose are linked to foraging at younger ages and collecting resources low in sucrose natural selection is able to directly shift the set of foraging behaviors by operating on the distribution of these genes in the honey bee population ( pankiw , 2003 ) when resource density is low in africanized honey bee habitats , it is necessary for the bees to harvest a greater variety of resources because they can not afford to be selective honey bees that are genetically inclined towards resources high in sucrose like concentrated nectar will not be able to sustain themselves in harsher environments the popular term '' killer bee '' has only limited scientific meaning today because there is no generally accepted fraction of genetic contribution used to establish a cut-off although the native east african lowland honey bees ( apis mellifera scutellata ) are smaller and build smaller comb cells than the european honey bees , their hybrids are not smaller according to the scientists who analyzed its genetic code , the western honey bee originated in africa and spread to eurasia in two ancient migrations in areas of suitable temperate climate , the survival traits of africanized honey bee colonies help them outperform european honey bee colonies the africanized honey bee is considered the honey bee of choice for beekeeping in brazil

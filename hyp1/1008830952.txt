inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time however , in practice , inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time ' this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption economies of scale – ideal condition of '' one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it , when he needs it '' principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production all these stock reasons can apply to any owner or product an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) '' new old stock '' ( sometimes abbreviated nos ) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used such merchandise may not be produced anymore , and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time manufacturers ' , distributors ' , and wholesalers ' inventory tends to cluster in warehouses retailers ' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a shop or store accessible to customers inventories not intended for sale to customers or to clients may be held in any premises an organization uses stock ties up cash and , if uncontrolled , it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore difficult to keep the costs associated with holding too much or too little inventory under control while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product a canned food manufacturer 's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned , empty cans and their lids ( or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components ) , labels , and anything else ( solder , glue , etc this may be vats of prepared food , filled cans not yet labeled or sub-assemblies of food components walsh , journal of construction engineerign and manabement , nov–dec 2014 , p 818 such as encountered in civilian infrastructure construction or oil and gas inventory may not only reflect physical items ( such as materials , parts , partially-finished sub-assemblies ) but also knowledge work-in-process ( such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated ) there are several costs associated with inventory : ordering cost setup cost holding cost shortage cost inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management the primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days ' ( or hours ' , etc holding excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain and the cost of holding it could have been utilized better elsewhere , i.e the secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization by integrating accurate demand forecasting with inventory management , rather than only looking at past averages , a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the '' can fit '' point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer , so it is simply cash sunk ( literally ) into the ground inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks the use of inventory proportionality in the united states is thought to have been inspired by japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by toyota motors in the 1980s however , the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed manufacturing management is more interested in inventory turnover ratio or average days to sell inventory since it tells them something about relative inventory levels this improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting , since the 'value ' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced while these accounting measures of inventory are very useful because of their simplicity , they are also fraught with the danger of their own assumptions inventory turn is a financial accounting tool for evaluating inventory and it is not necessarily a management tool it can also help to incentive 's progress and to ensure that reforms are sustainable and effective in the long term , by ensuring that success is appropriately recognized in both the formal and informal reward systems of the organization unfortunately , standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago , when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods

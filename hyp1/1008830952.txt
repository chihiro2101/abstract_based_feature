the scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time , carrying costs of inventory , asset management , inventory forecasting , inventory valuation , inventory visibility , future inventory price forecasting , physical inventory , available physical space , quality management , replenishment , returns and defective goods , and demand forecasting balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time however , in practice , inventory is to be maintained for consumption during 'variations in lead time ' this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption uncertainty – inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand , supply and movements of goods appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) '' new old stock '' ( sometimes abbreviated nos ) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used such merchandise may not be produced anymore , and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time ice cream for summer ) pipeline stock ( goods still in transit or in the process of distribution – have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet ) average daily/weekly usage quantity x lead time in days + safety stock while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product work in process , wip – materials and components that have begun their transformation to finished goods these are used in process of manufacture and as such these are neither raw material nor finished goods a canned food manufacturer 's materials inventory includes the ingredients to form the foods to be canned , empty cans and their lids ( or coils of steel or aluminum for constructing those components ) , labels , and anything else ( solder , glue , etc the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors ( wholesalers ) , to grocery stores ( retailers ) , and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like factory stores and outlet centers the partially completed work ( or work in process ) is a measure of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project , “ construction : one type of project production system ” , proceedings of 13th annual conference of the international group for lean construction inventory may not only reflect physical items ( such as materials , parts , partially-finished sub-assemblies ) but also knowledge work-in-process ( such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated ) a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time there are several costs associated with inventory : ordering cost setup cost holding cost shortage cost holding excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain and the cost of holding it could have been utilized better elsewhere , i.e by integrating accurate demand forecasting with inventory management , rather than only looking at past averages , a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade the use of inventory proportionality in the united states is thought to have been inspired by japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by toyota motors in the 1980s it seems that around 1880 relevance lost , johnson and kaplan , harvard business school press , 1987 , p126 there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products those companies ( especially in metalworking ) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility a variety of attempts to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the huge overhead of the information processing of the time this number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness this improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting , since the 'value ' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced inventory turn is a financial accounting tool for evaluating inventory and it is not necessarily a management tool today , with multistage-process companies , there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process ' ( wip ) when a merchant buys goods from inventory , the value of the inventory account is reduced by the cost of goods sold ( cogs ) '' he offers a substitute , called throughput accounting , that uses throughput ( money for goods sold to customers ) in place of output ( goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory ) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost also known as distressed or expired stock , distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass cash conversion

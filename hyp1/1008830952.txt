the scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time , carrying costs of inventory , asset management , inventory forecasting , inventory valuation , inventory visibility , future inventory price forecasting , physical inventory , available physical space , quality management , replenishment , returns and defective goods , and demand forecasting balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption economies of scale – ideal condition of '' one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it , when he needs it '' principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics stock keeping unit ( sku ) skus are clear , internal identification numbers assigned to each of the products and their variants skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) ice cream for summer ) pipeline stock ( goods still in transit or in the process of distribution – have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet ) average daily/weekly usage quantity x lead time in days + safety stock retailers ' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a shop or store accessible to customers stock ties up cash and , if uncontrolled , it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore difficult to keep the costs associated with holding too much or too little inventory under control while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers its finished good inventory consists of all the filled and labeled cans of food in its warehouse that it has manufactured and wishes to sell to food distributors ( wholesalers ) , to grocery stores ( retailers ) , and even perhaps to consumers through arrangements like factory stores and outlet centers the partially completed work ( or work in process ) is a measure of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project , “ construction : one type of project production system ” , proceedings of 13th annual conference of the international group for lean construction walsh , journal of construction engineerign and manabement , nov–dec 2014 , p 818 such as encountered in civilian infrastructure construction or oil and gas a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time ) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out holding excess inventory is sub-optimal because the money spent to obtain and the cost of holding it could have been utilized better elsewhere , i.e the secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization by integrating accurate demand forecasting with inventory management , rather than only looking at past averages , a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected one early example of inventory proportionality used in a retail application in the united states was for motor fuel inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks the use of inventory proportionality in the united states is thought to have been inspired by japanese just-in-time parts inventory management made famous by toyota motors in the 1980s it seems that around 1880 relevance lost , johnson and kaplan , harvard business school press , 1987 , p126 there was a change in manufacturing practice from companies with relatively homogeneous lines of products to horizontally integrated companies with unprecedented diversity in processes and products the managers now needed information on the effect of product-mix decisions on overall profits and therefore needed accurate product-cost information however , the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed the second formula then creates the new start point for the next period and gives a figure to be subtracted from the sales price to determine some form of sales-margin figure manufacturing management is more interested in inventory turnover ratio or average days to sell inventory since it tells them something about relative inventory levels these include : specific identification lower of cost or market weighted average cost moving-average cost fifo and lifo vmi and cmi have gained considerable attention due to the success of third-party vendors who offer added expertise and knowledge that organizations may not possess when a merchant buys goods from inventory , the value of the inventory account is reduced by the cost of goods sold ( cogs ) standard cost accounting uses ratios called efficiencies that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under '' standard '' conditions inventory credit refers to the use of stock , or inventory , as collateral to raise finance

the scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time , carrying costs of inventory , asset management , inventory forecasting , inventory valuation , inventory visibility , future inventory price forecasting , physical inventory , available physical space , quality management , replenishment , returns and defective goods , and demand forecasting balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances it also may include abc analysis , lot tracking , cycle counting support , etc management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption uncertainty – inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand , supply and movements of goods economies of scale – ideal condition of '' one unit at a time at a place where a user needs it , when he needs it '' principle tends to incur lots of costs in terms of logistics appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production special terms used in dealing with inventory management stock keeping unit ( sku ) skus are clear , internal identification numbers assigned to each of the products and their variants an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) such merchandise may not be produced anymore , and the new old stock may represent the only market source of a particular item at the present time ice cream for summer ) pipeline stock ( goods still in transit or in the process of distribution – have left the factory but not arrived at the customer yet ) average daily/weekly usage quantity x lead time in days + safety stock while accountants often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale , organizations – manufacturers , service providers and not-for-profits – also have inventories ( fixtures , furniture , supplies , etc retailers ' inventory may exist in a warehouse or in a shop or store accessible to customers stock ties up cash and , if uncontrolled , it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore difficult to keep the costs associated with holding too much or too little inventory under control while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers the partially completed work ( or work in process ) is a measure of inventory built during the work execution of a capital project , “ construction : one type of project production system ” , proceedings of 13th annual conference of the international group for lean construction a '' virtual inventory '' ( also known as a '' bank inventory '' ) enables a group of users to share common parts , especially where their availability at short notice may be critical but they are unlikely to required by more than a few bank members at any one time inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out by integrating accurate demand forecasting with inventory management , rather than only looking at past averages , a much more accurate and optimal outcome is expected inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade those companies ( especially in metalworking ) attempted to achieve success through economies of scope - the gains of jointly producing two or more products in one facility the dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions , and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost ' have distorted effective management 'cost ' accounting since that time this number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness so a factory with two inventory turns has six months stock on hand , which is generally not a good figure ( depending upon the industry ) , whereas a factory that moves from six turns to twelve turns has probably improved effectiveness by 100 % this improvement will have some negative results in the financial reporting , since the 'value ' now stored in the factory as inventory is reduced there are , in fact , so many things that can vary hidden under this appearance of simplicity that a variety of 'adjusting ' assumptions may be used business models , including just in time ( jit ) inventory , vendor managed inventory ( vmi ) and customer managed inventory ( cmi ) , attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns define inventory to suit their needs within us generally accepted accounting practices ( gaap ) , the rules defined by the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) ( and others ) and enforced by the u.s inventory appears as a current asset on an organization 's balance sheet because the organization can , in principle , turn it into cash by selling it unfortunately , standard cost accounting methods developed about 100 years ago , when labor comprised the most important cost in manufactured goods '' he offers a substitute , called throughput accounting , that uses throughput ( money for goods sold to customers ) in place of output ( goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory ) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost cash conversion cycle

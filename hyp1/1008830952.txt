the scope of inventory management concerns the balance between replenishment lead time , carrying costs of inventory , asset management , inventory forecasting , inventory valuation , inventory visibility , future inventory price forecasting , physical inventory , available physical space , quality management , replenishment , returns and defective goods , and demand forecasting balancing these competing requirements leads to optimal inventory levels , which is an ongoing process as the business needs shift and react to the wider environment inventory management involves a retailer seeking to acquire and maintain a proper merchandise assortment while ordering , shipping , handling , and related costs are kept in check it also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements , set targets , provide replenishment techniques , report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material this would include the monitoring of material moved into and out of stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances management of the inventories , with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system , functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs there are five basic reasons for keeping an inventory time – the time lags present in the supply chain , from supplier to user at every stage , requires that you maintain certain amounts of inventory to use in this lead time this can lead to stock accumulation , consider for example how goods consumed only in holidays can lead to accumulation of large stocks on the anticipation of future consumption uncertainty – inventories are maintained as buffers to meet uncertainties in demand , supply and movements of goods appreciation in value – in some situations , some stock gains the required value when it is kept for some time to allow it reach the desired standard for consumption , or for production stock keeping unit ( sku ) skus are clear , internal identification numbers assigned to each of the products and their variants skus can be any combination of letters and numbers chosen , just as long as the system is consistent and used for all the products in the inventory an sku code may also be referred to as product code , barcode , part number or mpn ( manufacturer 's part number ) stockout means running out of the inventory of an sku '' new old stock '' ( sometimes abbreviated nos ) is a term used in business to refer to merchandise being offered for sale that was manufactured long ago but that has never been used while accountants often discuss inventory in terms of goods for sale , organizations – manufacturers , service providers and not-for-profits – also have inventories ( fixtures , furniture , supplies , etc stock ties up cash and , if uncontrolled , it will be impossible to know the actual level of stocks and therefore difficult to keep the costs associated with holding too much or too little inventory under control while the reasons for holding stock were covered earlier , most manufacturing organizations usually divide their '' goods for sale '' inventory into : raw materials – materials and components scheduled for use in making a product work in process , wip – materials and components that have begun their transformation to finished goods finished goods – goods ready for sale to customers the firm 's work in process includes those materials from the time of release to the work floor until they become complete and ready for sale to wholesale or retail customers inventory may not only reflect physical items ( such as materials , parts , partially-finished sub-assemblies ) but also knowledge work-in-process ( such as partially completed engineering designs of components and assemblies to be fabricated ) inventory and logistics operations , cips study materials , profex publishing , 2012 , page 54 virtual inventory also allows distributors and fulfilment houses to ship goods to retailers direct from stock regardless of whether the stock is held in a retail store , stock room or warehouse inventory proportionality is the goal of demand-driven inventory management in such a case , there is no '' excess inventory '' , that is , inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out the secondary goal of inventory proportionality is inventory minimization integrating demand forecasting into inventory management in this way also allows for the prediction of the '' can fit '' point when inventory storage is limited on a per-product basis inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of motor fuel , each stored in dedicated tanks , in proportion to the sales of each grade inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks however , the burgeoning need for financial reporting after 1900 created unavoidable pressure for financial accounting of stock and the management need to cost manage products became overshadowed the dominance of financial reporting accounting over management accounting remains to this day with few exceptions , and the financial reporting definitions of 'cost ' have distorted effective management 'cost ' accounting since that time manufacturing management is more interested in inventory turnover ratio or average days to sell inventory since it tells them something about relative inventory levels this number tells how much cash/goods are tied up waiting for the process and is a critical measure of process reliability and effectiveness these include : specific identification lower of cost or market weighted average cost moving-average cost fifo and lifo business models , including just in time ( jit ) inventory , vendor managed inventory ( vmi ) and customer managed inventory ( cmi ) , attempt to minimize on-hand inventory and increase inventory turns today , with multistage-process companies , there is much inventory that would once have been finished goods which is now held as 'work in process ' ( wip ) standard cost accounting uses ratios called efficiencies that compare the labour and materials actually used to produce a good with those that the same goods would have required under '' standard '' conditions also known as distressed or expired stock , distressed inventory is inventory whose potential to be sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass inventory credit refers to the use of stock , or inventory , as collateral to raise finance where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral , for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking , inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints

the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group ( the proposition remains questionable , since modern biologists and game theorists do look to explain the 'structural laws of the whole ' in terms of 'the way the elements fit together ' as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues increasingly , research has applied evolutionary psychology principles to group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization moreno was a psychiatrist , dramatist , philosopher and theoretician who coined the term '' group psychotherapy '' in the early 1930s and was highly influential at the time schutz referred to these group dynamics as '' the interpersonal underworld , '' group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged , as opposed to '' content '' issues , which are nominally the agenda of group meetings palo alto , ca : science and behavior books he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups mourning the adjournment of the group ) scott peck developed stages for larger-scale groups ( i.e hackman suggested that groups are successful when they satisfy internal and external clients , develop capabilities to perform in the future , and when members find meaning and satisfaction in the group in companies , supportive contexts involves a ) reward systems that reward performance and cooperation ( e.g expert coaching : which occurs on the rare occasions when group members feel they need help with task or interpersonal issues hackman emphasizes that many team leaders are overbearing and undermine group effectiveness the dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s the social cohesion approach suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction additionally , from the social identity approach , group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others the psychology of social norms for example , in response to a natural disaster , an emergent response group may form these groups are characterized as having no preexisting structure ( e.g joining a group is determined by a number of different factors , including an individual 's personal traits ; gender ; social motives such as need for affiliation , need for power , and need for intimacy ; attachment style ; and prior group experiences groups can offer some advantages to its members that would not be possible if an individual decided to remain alone , including gaining social support in the forms of emotional support , instrumental support , and informational support however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group instead , our decision is based on two factors : our comparison level , and our comparison level for alternatives those individuals who have experienced positive rewards with few costs in previous relationships and groups will have a higher comparison level than a person who experienced more negative costs and fewer rewards in previous relationships and group memberships comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join thiabaut and kelley stated that the '' comparison level for alternatives can be defined informally as the lowest level of outcomes a member will accept in the light of available alternative opportunities ” joining and leaving groups is ultimately dependent on the comparison level for alternatives , whereas member satisfaction within a group depends on the comparison level if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group for example , three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group past research has identified four basic types of groups which include , but are not limited to : primary groups , social groups , collective groups , and categories for example , in an experiment , participants were asked to sort a number of groups into categories based on their own criteria individuals that are a part of primary groups consider the group to be an important part of their lives individuals can be born into a primary group ; however , primary groups can also form when individuals interact for extended periods of time in meaningful ways these groups tend to be larger , with shorter memberships compared to primary groups further , social groups do not have as stable memberships , since members are able to leave their social group and join new groups examples of social groups include coworkers , clubs , and sports teams collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks if individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity , then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group , known as essentialism one 's personal identity is defined by more idiosyncratic , individual qualities and attributes in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others our social identity and group membership also satisfies a need to belong optimal distinctiveness theory suggests that individuals have a desire to be similar to others , but also a desire to differentiate themselves , ultimately seeking some balance of these two desires ( to obtain optimal distinctiveness ) that is , to be similar to others ( those who you share group membership with ) , but also to be different from others ( those who are outside of your group ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected group cohesion , as a scientifically studied property of groups , is commonly associated with kurt lewin and his student , leon festinger later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group for example , emile durkheim described two forms of solidarity ( mechanical and organic ) , which created a sense of collective conscious and an emotion-based sense of community marginal members were once full members but lost membership because they failed to live up to the group 's expectations it is important that other group members perceive an individual 's status to be warranted and deserved , as otherwise they may not have authority within the group intergroup dynamics ( or intergroup relations ) refers to the behavioural and psychological relationship between two or more groups further , he suggested four optimal conditions for contact : equal status between the groups in the situation ; common goals ; intergroup cooperation ; and the support of authorities , law , or customs

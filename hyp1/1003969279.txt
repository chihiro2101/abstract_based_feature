the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology on the sociological side , émile durkheim ( 1858–1917 ) , who was influenced by wundt , also recognized collective phenomena , such as public knowledge ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues increasingly , research has applied evolutionary psychology principles to group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically schutz sees groups resolving each issue in turn in order to be able to progress to the next stage schutz referred to these group dynamics as '' the interpersonal underworld , '' group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged , as opposed to '' content '' issues , which are nominally the agenda of group meetings he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups bruce tuckman ( 1965 ) proposed the four-stage model called tuckman 's stages for a group if distrust persists , a group may never even get to the norming stage , communities ) which are similar to tuckman 's stages of group development examples of common barriers are : expectations and preconceptions ; prejudices ; ideology , counterproductive norms , theology and solutions ; the need to heal , convert , fix or solve and the need to control richard hackman developed a synthetic , research-based model for designing and managing work groups hackman suggested that groups are successful when they satisfy internal and external clients , develop capabilities to perform in the future , and when members find meaning and satisfaction in the group hackman proposed five conditions that increase the chance that groups will be successful group based rewards linked to group performance ) , b ) an educational system that develops member skills , c ) an information and materials system that provides the needed information and raw materials ( e.g expert coaching : which occurs on the rare occasions when group members feel they need help with task or interpersonal issues hackman emphasizes that many team leaders are overbearing and undermine group effectiveness amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions the dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group often , there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s for each of these groups , there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed additionally , from the social identity approach , group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others emergent groups arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation group membership , allocated roles ) or prior experience working together it also offers friendship , potential new interests , learning new skills , and enhancing self esteem according to the social exchange theory , group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group 's outcomes , in terms of costs and rewards , are above the individual 's comparison level comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group to determine whether people will actually join or leave a group , the value of other , alternative groups needs to be taken into account this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join to summarize , if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level , the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available for example , in an experiment , participants were asked to sort a number of groups into categories based on their own criteria primary groups are characterized by relatively small , long-lasting groups of individuals who share personally meaningful relationships examples of primary groups include family , close friends , and gangs a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group categories are characterized by a collection of individuals who are similar in some way if individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity , then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group , known as essentialism an individual 's identity ( or self-concept ) has two components : personal identity and social identity ( or collective self ) in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others in this way , these comparisons give us a distinct and valued social identity that benefits our self-esteem that is , to be similar to others ( those who you share group membership with ) , but also to be different from others ( those who are outside of your group ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected group cohesion , as a scientifically studied property of groups , is commonly associated with kurt lewin and his student , leon festinger lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together , and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group for example , emile durkheim described two forms of solidarity ( mechanical and organic ) , which created a sense of collective conscious and an emotion-based sense of community prescriptive norms : the socially appropriate way to respond in a social situation , or what group members are supposed to do ( e.g it is important that other group members perceive an individual 's status to be warranted and deserved , as otherwise they may not have authority within the group on simple tasks , where the individual is not challenged by the task , the interference effect is negligible and performance , therefore , is facilitated intergroup conflict can be highly competitive , especially for social groups with a long history of conflict ( for example , the 1994 rwandan genocide , rooted in group conflict between the ethnic hutu and tutsi )

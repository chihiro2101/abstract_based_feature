the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group ( the proposition remains questionable , since modern biologists and game theorists do look to explain the 'structural laws of the whole ' in terms of 'the way the elements fit together ' as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization '' hammer , espen adorno and the political , pp.58-9 moreno was a psychiatrist , dramatist , philosopher and theoretician who coined the term '' group psychotherapy '' in the early 1930s and was highly influential at the time kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances william schutz ( 1958 , 1966 ) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental , inclusion ( am i included ? ) , control ( who is top dog here ? ) , and affection ( do i belong here ? ) schutz referred to these group dynamics as '' the interpersonal underworld , '' group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged , as opposed to '' content '' issues , which are nominally the agenda of group meetings he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in yalom , the theory and practice of group psychotherapy , third edition , basic books ( 1985 ) , hardback , bion 's experiences are reported in his published books , especially experiences in groups bruce tuckman ( 1965 ) proposed the four-stage model called tuckman 's stages for a group if distrust persists , a group may never even get to the norming stage , communities ) which are similar to tuckman 's stages of group development hackman suggested that groups are successful when they satisfy internal and external clients , develop capabilities to perform in the future , and when members find meaning and satisfaction in the group leading teams : setting the stage for great performances enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour in companies , supportive contexts involves a ) reward systems that reward performance and cooperation ( e.g examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s for each of these groups , there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed notably , on this very broad level , the study of group dynamics is similar to the study of culture so to say , a level of psychological distinctiveness is necessary for group formation the psychology of social norms for example , in response to a natural disaster , an emergent response group may form group membership , allocated roles ) or prior experience working together it also offers friendship , potential new interests , learning new skills , and enhancing self esteem according to howard kelley and john thibaut , a group may be attractive to us in terms of costs and benefits , but that attractiveness alone does not determine whether or not we will join the group this comparison level is influenced by previous relationships and membership in different groups those individuals who have experienced positive rewards with few costs in previous relationships and groups will have a higher comparison level than a person who experienced more negative costs and fewer rewards in previous relationships and group memberships as well , group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual 's comparison level comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group to summarize , if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level , the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available when group membership is below the comparison level for alternatives but above the comparison level , membership is satisfying but an individual will be unlikely to join if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group past research has identified four basic types of groups which include , but are not limited to : primary groups , social groups , collective groups , and categories it is important to define these four types of groups because they are intuitive to most lay people consequently , members strongly identify with their group , even without regular meetings for example , individuals are born into a primary group , their family , which creates a foundation for them to base their future relationships collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks we naturally make comparisons between our own group and other groups , but we do not necessarily make objective comparisons in this way , these comparisons give us a distinct and valued social identity that benefits our self-esteem therefore , one 's social identity can have several , qualitatively distinct parts ( for example , one 's ethnic identity , religious identity , and political identity ) it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change group cohesion , as a scientifically studied property of groups , is commonly associated with kurt lewin and his student , leon festinger lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together , and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group since then , several models for understanding the concept of group cohesion have been developed , including albert carron 's hierarchical model and several bi-dimensional models ( vertical v a group with a high level of role differentiation would be categorized as having many different roles that are specialized and narrowly defined prescriptive norms : the socially appropriate way to respond in a social situation , or what group members are supposed to do ( e.g in his theory of social facilitation , zajonc concluded that in the presence of others , when action is required , depending on the task requirement , either social facilitation or social interference will impact the outcome of the task this includes perceptions , attitudes , opinions , and behaviours towards one 's own group , as well as those towards another group

the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology wilhelm wundt ( 1832–1920 ) , credited as the founder of experimental psychology , had a particular interest in the psychology of communities , which he believed possessed phenomena ( human language , customs , and religion ) that could not be described through a study of the individual eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances wilfred bion ( 1961 ) studied group dynamics from a psychoanalysis perspective , and stated that he was much influenced by wilfred trotter for whom he worked at university college hospital london , as did another key figure in the psychoanalytic movement , ernest jones he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways peck describes the stages of a community as : pseudo-community chaos emptiness true community communities may be distinguished from other types of groups , in peck 's view , by the need for members to eliminate barriers to communication in order to be able to form true community these include : being a real team : which results from having a shared task , clear boundaries which clarify who is inside or outside of the group , and stability in group membership enabling structure : which results from having tasks which have variety , a group size that is not too large , talented group members who have at least moderate social skill , and strong norms that specify appropriate behaviour supportive context : which occurs in groups nested in larger groups ( e.g in companies , supportive contexts involves a ) reward systems that reward performance and cooperation ( e.g group based rewards linked to group performance ) , b ) an educational system that develops member skills , c ) an information and materials system that provides the needed information and raw materials ( e.g examples of groups include religious , political , military , and environmental groups , sports teams , work groups , and therapy groups amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s for example , there are group dynamics in the u.s the social cohesion approach suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction additionally , from the social identity approach , group formation involves both identifying with some individuals and explicitly not identifying with others through interaction , individuals begin to develop group norms , roles , and attitudes which define the group , and are internalized to influence behaviour emergent groups arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation group membership , allocated roles ) or prior experience working together however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group the minimax principle is a part of social exchange theory that states that people will join and remain in a group that can provide them with the maximum amount of valuable rewards while at the same time , ensuring the minimum amount of costs to themselves instead , our decision is based on two factors : our comparison level , and our comparison level for alternatives this comparison level is influenced by previous relationships and membership in different groups according to the social exchange theory , group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group 's outcomes , in terms of costs and rewards , are above the individual 's comparison level ” joining and leaving groups is ultimately dependent on the comparison level for alternatives , whereas member satisfaction within a group depends on the comparison level to summarize , if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives and above the comparison level , the membership within the group will be satisfying and an individual will be more likely to join the group if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available when group membership is below the comparison level for alternatives but above the comparison level , membership is satisfying but an individual will be unlikely to join if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group since these groups often interact face-to-face , they know each other very well and are unified cooley believed that primary groups were essential for integrating individuals into their society since this is often their first experience with a group examples of primary groups include family , close friends , and gangs a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group these groups tend to be larger , with shorter memberships compared to primary groups examples of social groups include coworkers , clubs , and sports teams categories are characterized by a collection of individuals who are similar in some way for this reason , categories can appear to be higher in entitativity and essentialism than primary , social , and collective groups the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity one 's personal identity is defined by more idiosyncratic , individual qualities and attributes optimal distinctiveness theory suggests that individuals have a desire to be similar to others , but also a desire to differentiate themselves , ultimately seeking some balance of these two desires ( to obtain optimal distinctiveness ) one 's collective self may offer a balance between these two desires that is , to be similar to others ( those who you share group membership with ) , but also to be different from others ( those who are outside of your group ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change lewin defined group cohesion as the willingness of individuals to stick together , and believed that without cohesiveness a group could not exist later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group individuals tend to upgrade likeable in-group members and deviate from unlikeable group members , making them a separate outgroup a key role in a group is the leader , but there are other important roles as well , including task roles , relationship roles , and individual roles examining the intermember relations of a group can highlight a group 's density ( how many members are linked to one another ) , or the degree centrality of members ( number of ties between members ) it is important that other group members perceive an individual 's status to be warranted and deserved , as otherwise they may not have authority within the group this includes perceptions , attitudes , opinions , and behaviours towards one 's own group , as well as those towards another group according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup )

the history of group dynamics ( or group processes ) has a consistent , underlying premise : 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group ( the proposition remains questionable , since modern biologists and game theorists do look to explain the 'structural laws of the whole ' in terms of 'the way the elements fit together ' as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology wilhelm wundt ( 1832–1920 ) , credited as the founder of experimental psychology , had a particular interest in the psychology of communities , which he believed possessed phenomena ( human language , customs , and religion ) that could not be described through a study of the individual ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically william schutz ( 1958 , 1966 ) looked at interpersonal relations as stage-developmental , inclusion ( am i included ? ) , control ( who is top dog here ? ) , and affection ( do i belong here ? ) schutz referred to these group dynamics as '' the interpersonal underworld , '' group processes which are largely unseen and un-acknowledged , as opposed to '' content '' issues , which are nominally the agenda of group meetings he discovered several mass group processes which involved the group as a whole adopting an orientation which , in his opinion , interfered with the ability of a group to accomplish the work it was nominally engaged in this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways if distrust persists , a group may never even get to the norming stage a community is born when its members reach a stage of '' emptiness '' or peace hackman emphasizes that many team leaders are overbearing and undermine group effectiveness intragroup dynamics ( also referred to as ingroup- , within-group , or commonly just ‘ group dynamics ’ ) are the underlying processes that give rise to a set of norms , roles , relations , and common goals that characterize a particular social group amongst the members of a group , there is a state of interdependence , through which the behaviours , attitudes , opinions , and experiences of each member are collectively influenced by the other group members often , there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s for each of these groups , there are distinct dynamics that can be discussed for example , there are group dynamics in the u.s group formation starts with a psychological bond between individuals the social cohesion approach suggests that group formation comes out of bonds of interpersonal attraction emergent groups arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation yet , these groups still express high levels of interdependence and coordinate knowledge , resources , and tasks according to the social exchange theory , group membership will be more satisfying to a new prospective member if the group 's outcomes , in terms of costs and rewards , are above the individual 's comparison level as well , group membership will be unsatisfying to a new member if the outcomes are below the individual 's comparison level comparison level only predicts how satisfied a new member will be with the social relationships within the group to determine whether people will actually join or leave a group , the value of other , alternative groups needs to be taken into account this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group for example , three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group past research has identified four basic types of groups which include , but are not limited to : primary groups , social groups , collective groups , and categories it is important to define these four types of groups because they are intuitive to most lay people examples of groups to be sorted were a sports team , a family , people at a bus stop and women primary groups are characterized by relatively small , long-lasting groups of individuals who share personally meaningful relationships consequently , members strongly identify with their group , even without regular meetings cooley believed that primary groups were essential for integrating individuals into their society since this is often their first experience with a group for example , individuals are born into a primary group , their family , which creates a foundation for them to base their future relationships a social group is characterized by a formally organized group of individuals who are not as emotionally involved with each other as those in a primary group these groups tend to be larger , with shorter memberships compared to primary groups examples of social groups include coworkers , clubs , and sports teams collectives are characterized by large groups of individuals who display similar actions or outlooks for example , when people treat others differently because of their race , this creates groups of different races for this reason , categories can appear to be higher in entitativity and essentialism than primary , social , and collective groups entitativity is defined by campbell as the extent to which collections of individuals are perceived to be a group the degree of entitativity that a group has is influenced by whether a collection of individuals experience the same fate , display similarities , and are close in proximity an individual 's identity ( or self-concept ) has two components : personal identity and social identity ( or collective self ) instead , we make evaluations that are self-enhancing , emphasizing the positive qualities of our own group ( see ingroup bias ) therefore , one 's social identity can have several , qualitatively distinct parts ( for example , one 's ethnic identity , religious identity , and political identity ) frequently studied elements of group structure include roles , norms , values , communication patterns , and status differentials analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group , which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group ( e.g this dynamogenic factor is believed to have laid the groundwork for what is now known as social facilitation—an '' improvement in task performance that occurs when people work in the presence of other people '' several theories analysing performance gains in groups via drive , motivational , cognitive and personality processes , explain why social facilitation occurs nickolas cottrell , 1972 , proposed the evaluation apprehension model whereby he suggested people associate social situations with an evaluative process according to social identity theory , intergroup conflict starts with a process of comparison between individuals in one group ( the ingroup ) to those of another group ( the outgroup )

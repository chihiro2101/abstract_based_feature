' a social group is an entity that has qualities which can not be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group as a field of study , group dynamics has roots in both psychology and sociology ( the concept of a collective consciousness is not essential to group dynamics eventually , the social psychology kurt lewin ( 1890–1947 ) coined the term group dynamics to describe the positive and negative forces within groups of people in 1945 , he established the group dynamics research center at the massachusetts institute of technology , the first institute devoted explicitly to the study of group dynamics throughout his career , lewin was focused on how the study of group dynamics could be applied to real-world , social issues as humans social environments became more complex , they acquired adaptations by way of group dynamics that enhance survival examples include mechanisms for dealing with status , reciprocity , identifying cheaters , ostracism , altruism , group decision , leadership , and intergroup relations also , a combination of evolution and game theory has been used to explain the development and maintenance of cooperative behavior between individuals in a group gustave le bon was a french social psychologist whose seminal study , the crowd : a study of the popular mind ( 1896 ) led to the development of group psychology the british psychologist william mcdougall in his work the group mind ( 1920 ) researched the dynamics of groups of various sizes and degrees of organization in group psychology and the analysis of the ego , ( 1922 ) , sigmund freud based his preliminary description of group psychology on le bon 's work , but went on to develop his own , original theory , related to what he had begun to elaborate in totem and taboo theodor adorno reprised freud 's essay in 1951 with his freudian theory and the pattern of fascist propaganda , and said that '' it is not an overstatement if we say that freud , though he was hardly interested in the political phase of the problem , clearly foresaw the rise and nature of fascist mass movements in purely psychological categories moreno was a psychiatrist , dramatist , philosopher and theoretician who coined the term '' group psychotherapy '' in the early 1930s and was highly influential at the time kurt lewin ( 1943 , 1948 , 1951 ) is commonly identified as the founder of the movement to study groups scientifically he coined the term group dynamics to describe the way groups and individuals act and react to changing circumstances conversely , a struggling group can devolve to an earlier stage , if unable to resolve outstanding issues at its present stage bruce tuckman ( 1965 ) proposed the four-stage model called tuckman 's stages for a group this model refers to the overall pattern of the group , but of course individuals within a group work in different ways , communities ) which are similar to tuckman 's stages of group development a community is born when its members reach a stage of '' emptiness '' or peace richard hackman developed a synthetic , research-based model for designing and managing work groups supportive context : which occurs in groups nested in larger groups ( e.g in many fields of research , there is an interest in understanding how group dynamics influence individual behaviour , attitudes , and opinions the dynamics of a particular group depend on how one defines the boundaries of the group often , there are distinct subgroups within a more broadly defined group for example , one could define u.s residents ( ‘ americans ’ ) as a group , but could also define a more specific set of u.s residents ( for example , 'americans in the south ' ) through interaction , individuals begin to develop group norms , roles , and attitudes which define the group , and are internalized to influence behaviour emergent groups arise from a relatively spontaneous process of group formation however , joining a group may also cost an individual time , effort , and personal resources as they may conform to social pressures and strive to reap the benefits that may be offered by the group according to howard kelley and john thibaut , a group may be attractive to us in terms of costs and benefits , but that attractiveness alone does not determine whether or not we will join the group in john thibaut and harold kelley 's social exchange theory , comparison level is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the desirability of becoming a member of the group and forming new social relationships within the group this comparison level is influenced by previous relationships and membership in different groups this comparison level for alternatives is the standard by which an individual will evaluate the quality of the group in comparison to other groups the individual has the opportunity to join ” joining and leaving groups is ultimately dependent on the comparison level for alternatives , whereas member satisfaction within a group depends on the comparison level if membership in the group is above the comparison level for alternatives but below the comparison level , membership will be not be satisfactory ; however , the individual will likely join the group since no other desirable options are available if group membership is below both the comparison and alternative comparison levels , membership will be dissatisfying and the individual will be less likely to join the group groups can vary drastically from one another for example , three best friends who interact every day as well as a collection of people watching a movie in a theater both constitute a group it is important to define these four types of groups because they are intuitive to most lay people examples of groups to be sorted were a sports team , a family , people at a bus stop and women it was found that participants consistently sorted groups into four categories : intimacy groups , task groups , loose associations , and social categories for example , individuals are born into a primary group , their family , which creates a foundation for them to base their future relationships if individuals believe that a group is high in entitativity , then they are likely to believe that the group has unchanging characteristics that are essential to the group , known as essentialism an individual 's identity ( or self-concept ) has two components : personal identity and social identity ( or collective self ) in contrast , one 's social identity is defined by his or her group membership , and the general characteristics ( or prototypes ) that define the group and differentiate it from others our social identity and group membership also satisfies a need to belong therefore , one 's social identity can have several , qualitatively distinct parts ( for example , one 's ethnic identity , religious identity , and political identity ) optimal distinctiveness theory suggests that individuals have a desire to be similar to others , but also a desire to differentiate themselves , ultimately seeking some balance of these two desires ( to obtain optimal distinctiveness ) in the social sciences , group cohesion refers to the processes that keep members of a social group connected terms such as attraction , solidarity , and morale are often used to describe group cohesion it is thought to be one of the most important characteristics of a group , and has been linked to group performance , group conflict and therapeutic change later , this definition was modified to describe the forces acting on individual members to remain in the group , termed attraction to the group whereas new members of a group must prove themselves to the full members to become accepted , full members have undergone socialization and are already accepted within the group marginal members were once full members but lost membership because they failed to live up to the group 's expectations one member may not personally agree with something the group does , but to avoid the black sheep effect , they will publicly agree with the group and keep the private beliefs to themselves if the person is privately self-aware , he or she is more likely to comply with the group even if they possibly have their own beliefs about the situation analysing the intermember relations aspect of a group can highlight the degree centrality of each member in the group , which can lead to a better understanding of the roles of certain group ( e.g this dynamogenic factor is believed to have laid the groundwork for what is now known as social facilitation—an '' improvement in task performance that occurs when people work in the presence of other people '' this includes perceptions , attitudes , opinions , and behaviours towards one 's own group , as well as those towards another group other prominent theories relating to intergroup conflict include social dominance theory , and social-/self-categorization theory

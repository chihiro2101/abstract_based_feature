when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries block-artifacts are a result of the very principle of block transform coding the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized the lower the bit rate , the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero in the most extreme case only the dc-coefficient , that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block , is retained , and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction no post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases ; consequently , none has garnered widespread acceptance , though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems block boundary discontinuities can occur at edges of motion compensation prediction blocks in motion compensated video compression , the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks ( macroblocks , partitions , or prediction units ) of pixels from previously decoded frames if this '' decoder '' performs a deblocking , the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation , which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts in still images , an example is jpegs by german photographer thomas ruff , which uses intentional jpeg artifacts as the basis of the picture 's style

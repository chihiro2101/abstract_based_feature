when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized the lower the bit rate , the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero in the most extreme case only the dc-coefficient , that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block , is retained , and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction no post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases ; consequently , none has garnered widespread acceptance , though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems instead of just multiplying the quantized coefficients with the quantisation step pertaining to the 2d-frequency , intelligent noise in the form of a random number in the interval can be added to the dequantized coefficient data errors in the compressed bit-stream , possibly due to transmission errors , can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors , or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time , leading to '' break-up '' of the picture p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts an example of compression artifacts in audio is applause in a relatively highly compressed audio file ( e.g compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art

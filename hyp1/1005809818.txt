when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries the term macroblocking is commonly used regardless of the artifact 's cause block-artifacts are a result of the very principle of block transform coding the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized this method can be added as an integral part to jpeg decompressors working on the trillions of existing and future jpeg images where gross errors have occurred in the bit-stream , decoders continue to apply updates to the damaged picture for a short interval , creating a '' ghost image '' effect , until receiving the next independently compressed frame motion compensation block boundary artifacts p.930 ( 08/96 ) principles of a reference impairment system for video the so-called '' mosquito noise '' is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards , such as the mpeg formats as in still image coding , it is possible to apply a deblocking filter to the decoder output as post-processing when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art

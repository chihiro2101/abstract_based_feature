when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries block-artifacts are a result of the very principle of block transform coding the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized statistically , images have more low-frequency than high-frequency content , so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization , which results in blurry , low-resolution blocks no post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases ; consequently , none has garnered widespread acceptance , though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems posterization generally only happens at low quality , when the dc values are given too little importance in motion compensated video compression , the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks ( macroblocks , partitions , or prediction units ) of pixels from previously decoded frames if this '' decoder '' performs a deblocking , the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation , which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames an example of compression artifacts in audio is applause in a relatively highly compressed audio file ( e.g rosa menkman 's glitch art makes use of compression artifacts , particularly the discrete cosine transform blocks ( dct blocks ) found in most digital media data compression formats such as jpeg digital images and mp3 digital audio in still images , an example is jpegs by german photographer thomas ruff , which uses intentional jpeg artifacts as the basis of the picture 's style another technique involves simply transcoding from one lossy video format to another , which exploits the difference in how the separate video codecs process motion and color information

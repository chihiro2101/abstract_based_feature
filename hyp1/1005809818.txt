when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear this has been observed to happen with jbig2 in certain photocopier machines at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries these boundaries can transform block boundaries , prediction block boundaries , or both , and may coincide with macroblock boundaries block-artifacts are a result of the very principle of block transform coding the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized the lower the bit rate , the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero consumer equipment often calls this post-processing '' mpeg noise reduction '' this method can be added as an integral part to jpeg decompressors working on the trillions of existing and future jpeg images the artifacts at block boundaries can be reduced by applying a deblocking filter lossy audio compression typically works with a psychoacoustic modelâ€”a model of human hearing perception when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style , sometimes known as glitch art

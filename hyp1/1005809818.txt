when performing block-based discrete cosine transform ( dct ) coding for quantization , as in jpeg-compressed images , several types of artifacts can appear at low bit rates , any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries the transform ( for example the discrete cosine transform ) is applied to a block of pixels , and to achieve lossy compression , the transform coefficients of each block are quantized the lower the bit rate , the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero because this quantization process is applied individually in each block , neighboring blocks quantize coefficients differently boundary artifact in jpeg can be turned into more pleasing '' grains '' not unlike those in high iso photographic films instead of just multiplying the quantized coefficients with the quantisation step pertaining to the 2d-frequency , intelligent noise in the form of a random number in the interval can be added to the dequantized coefficient this method can be added as an integral part to jpeg decompressors working on the trillions of existing and future jpeg images when motion prediction is used , as in mpeg-1 , mpeg-2 or mpeg-4 , compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames , and move with the optic flow of the image , leading to a peculiar effect , part way between a painting effect and '' grime '' that moves with objects in the scene in motion compensated video compression , the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks ( macroblocks , partitions , or prediction units ) of pixels from previously decoded frames if this '' decoder '' performs a deblocking , the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation , which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames when the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate , when the transform block size is restrained , or when aggressive compression is used , this may result in compression artifacts rosa menkman 's glitch art makes use of compression artifacts , particularly the discrete cosine transform blocks ( dct blocks ) found in most digital media data compression formats such as jpeg digital images and mp3 digital audio

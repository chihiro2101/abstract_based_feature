dinitrogen tetroxide could be regarded as two nitro groups ( -no 2 ) bonded together it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide the molecule is planar with an n-n bond distance of 1.78å and n-o distances of 1.19å inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia : steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper the oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid , presence of oxygen , and other factors nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used when exposed to oxygen , no is converted back into nitrogen dioxide : : 2 no + o 2 → 2 no 2 the resulting no 2 and n 2 o 4 can be returned to the cycle to give the mixture of nitrous and nitric acids again

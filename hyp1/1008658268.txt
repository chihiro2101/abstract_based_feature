it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide the liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of no 2 according to the following equilibrium : : n 2 o 4 â‡Œ 2 no 2 higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper this synthesis is more practical in a laboratory setting and is commonly used as a demonstration or experiment in undergraduate chemistry labs the oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid , presence of oxygen , and other factors nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature in early 1944 , research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by german scientists , although the germans only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for s-stoff ( fuming nitric acid ) when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used if metal nitrates are prepared from n 2 o 4 in completely anhydrous conditions , a range of covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals

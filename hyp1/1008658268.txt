dinitrogen tetroxide could be regarded as two nitro groups ( -no 2 ) bonded together it forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia : steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature the gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide , which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier the unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature it is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used '' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours

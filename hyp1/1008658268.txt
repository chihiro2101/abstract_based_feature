the molecule is planar with an n-n bond distance of 1.78å and n-o distances of 1.19å inevitably , some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia : steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper the oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid , presence of oxygen , and other factors the unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizer in one of the most important rocket propellants because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature in early 1944 , research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by german scientists , although the germans only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for s-stoff ( fuming nitric acid ) gemini and apollo spacecraft and also on the space shuttle , it continues to be used as station-keeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites , and many deep-space probes when used as a propellant , dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide and the abbreviation nto is extensively used '' cool '' dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated , causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight

quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at low cell density , the molecules may just diffuse away gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptides ( aip ) as their autoinducers when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase the kinase phosphorylates a transcription factor , which regulates gene transcription gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule fischeri is the first organism in which qs was observed as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction on one hand , a phenotypic switch of the colonizer curvibacter takes place indeed , one explanation is that with a 3-oxo-hsl quorum-sensing signal , there is an up-regulation of flagellar assembly therefore , bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues another explanation is that 3-hydroxy-hsl induces carbon metabolism and fatty acid degradation genes in hydra this allows the bacterial metabolism to adjust itself to the host growth conditions , which is essential for the colonization of the ectodermal mucus layer of hydrae coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing transcription of the lsr operon is also thought to be inhibited by dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( dhap ) through its competitive binding to lsrr glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through camp-capk-mediated inhibition coli and salmonella enterica do not produce ahl signals commonly found in other gram-negative bacteria salmonella does not detect ahl when passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of several animal species , suggesting that the normal microbiota does not produce ahls another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism it is hoped that the therapeutic enzymatic degradation of the signaling molecules will prevent the formation of such biofilms and possibly weaken established biofilms shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well many bacterial species , including e coli , an enteric bacterium and model organism for gram-negative bacteria , produce ai-2 '' farnesol is used by the fungus candida albicans as a quorum sensing molecule that inhibits filamentation as mentioned before , n-acyl-homoserine lactones ( ahl ) are the quorum sensing signaling molecules of the gram-negative bacteria this technique has also been translated to agriculture , to restrict the spread of pathogenic bacteria that use quorum sensing in plants quorum sensing can be a useful tool for improving the function of self-organizing networks such as the secoas ( self-organizing collegiate sensor ) environmental monitoring system ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing , by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms

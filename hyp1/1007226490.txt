quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j these bacteria did not synthesize luciferase—and therefore did not luminesce—in freshly inoculated culture but only after the bacterial population had increased significantly because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at low cell density , the molecules may just diffuse away at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule usually ahls do not need additional processing , and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well fischeri bioluminescence is regulated by ahls ( n-acyl-homoserine lactones ) which is a product of the luxi gene whose transcription is regulated by the luxr activator as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity even though their function in host-microbe interaction is largely unknown , curvibacter quorum-sensing signals are relevant for host-microbe interactions indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction the most likely explanation is that the binding of 3-oxo-hsl and 3-hydroxy-hsl causes different conformational changes in the ahl receptors curr1 and curr2 as a result , there is a different dna-binding motif affinity and thereby different target genes are activated therefore , bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues this species uses ai-2 , which is produced and processed by the lsr operon part of it encodes an abc transporter , which imports ai-2 into the cells during the early stationery ( latent ) phase of growth however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria sdia detects ahls produced by other species of bacteria including aeromonas hydrophila , hafnia alvei , and yersinia enterocolitica the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of biofilm , swarming motility , exopolysaccharide production , virulence , and cell aggregation these bacteria can grow within a host without harming it until they reach a threshold concentration another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism it is hoped that the therapeutic enzymatic degradation of the signaling molecules will prevent the formation of such biofilms and possibly weaken established biofilms shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity yenr activates the expression of a bacterial small rna , yens . interaction of quorum-sensing molecules with mammalian cells and its medical applications further research into this inter-kingdom communication also enhances the possibility of learning about quorum sensing in humans furanones have also been found to act on ahl-dependant transcriptional activity , whereby the half life of the autoinducer-binding luxr protein is significantly shortened therefore , there exist many different ahl signaling molecules , for example , 3-oxododecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone ( 3oc12-hsl ) or 3-hydroxydodecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone ( 3ohc12-hsl ) once the ants sense a quorum , they return to the destroyed nest and begin rapidly carrying the brood , queen , and fellow workers to the new nest quorum sensing has been engineered using synthetic biological circuits in different systems cell signaling collective behavior interspecies quorum sensing microbial intelligence pheromone

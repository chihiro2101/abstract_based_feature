quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours some common phenotypes include biofilm formation , virulence factor expression , and motility certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment it can occur within a single bacterial species , as well as between diverse species both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response at low cell density , the molecules may just diffuse away at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule usually ahls do not need additional processing , and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression moreover , a study showed that these host associated curvibacter bacteria produce a broad spectrum of ahl , explaining the presence of those operons as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , one explanation is that with a 3-oxo-hsl quorum-sensing signal , there is an up-regulation of flagellar assembly yet , flagellin , the main protein component of flagella , can act as an immunomodulator and activate the innate immune response in hydra coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing part of it encodes an abc transporter , which imports ai-2 into the cells during the early stationery ( latent ) phase of growth glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through camp-capk-mediated inhibition sdia detects ahls produced by other species of bacteria including aeromonas hydrophila , hafnia alvei , and yersinia enterocolitica however , sdia does become activated when salmonella transits through turtles colonized with aeromonas hydrophila or mice infected with yersinia enterocolitica therefore , salmonella appears to use sdia to detect the ahl production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition this bacterium , an emerging pathogen , produces ahls shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity have been isolated from various infected sites from patients ( bile , blood , peritoneal fluid , pus , stool and urine ) it has been documented that aeromonas sobria has produced c6-hsl and two additional ahls with n-acyl side chain longer than c6 this indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient , and arose very early in the proteobacteria lineage closantel and triclosan are known inhibitors of quorum sensing enzymes & nbsp ; these groups inhibit receptors from binding substrate or decrease the concentration of receptors in the cell those bacteria produce 3-oxo-hsl quorum sensing molecules several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing , by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions dedicated issue of philosophical transactions b on quorum sensing ( 2007 )

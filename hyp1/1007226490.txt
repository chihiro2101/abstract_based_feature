quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response this process is highly dependent on the diffusion mechanism of the signaling molecules qs signaling molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptides ( aip ) as their autoinducers when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well it lives as a mutualistic symbiont in the photophore ( or light-producing organ ) of the hawaiian bobtail squid however , when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore ( about cells/ml ) , transcription of luciferase is induced , leading to bioluminescence as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction as a result , there is a different dna-binding motif affinity and thereby different target genes are activated another explanation is that 3-hydroxy-hsl induces carbon metabolism and fatty acid degradation genes in hydra glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through camp-capk-mediated inhibition recent studies have discovered that anaerobiosis can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing this important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on the production of virulence factors of this organism disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition also show quorum sensing activity this bacterium , an emerging pathogen , produces ahls shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity have been isolated from various infected sites from patients ( bile , blood , peritoneal fluid , pus , stool and urine ) yens inhibits yeni expression and acylhomoserine lactone production '' farnesol is used by the fungus candida albicans as a quorum sensing molecule that inhibits filamentation certain bacteria can produce enzymes called lactonases that can target and inactivate ahls mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount overall , the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the proteobacteria phylum as a whole this indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient , and arose very early in the proteobacteria lineage this result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome the role of quorum-sensing molecules was better explained according to three categories : host physiologyâ€“based impact of quorum sensing molecules ; ecological effects ; and cellular signaling those bacteria produce 3-oxo-hsl quorum sensing molecules eventually , the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold , indicating that the quorum number has been reached quorum sensing has been engineered using synthetic biological circuits in different systems

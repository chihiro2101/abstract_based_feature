quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j these bacteria did not synthesize luciferase—and therefore did not luminesce—in freshly inoculated culture but only after the bacterial population had increased significantly because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms at low cell density , the molecules may just diffuse away at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression when gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of aips in their environment , that happens by way of aips binding to a receptor to activate a kinase usually ahls do not need additional processing , and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well however , when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore ( about cells/ml ) , transcription of luciferase is induced , leading to bioluminescence curvibacter is a gram-negative curved rod-formed bacterium which is the main colonizer of the epithelial cell surfaces of the early branching metazoan hydra vulgaris moreover , a study showed that these host associated curvibacter bacteria produce a broad spectrum of ahl , explaining the presence of those operons as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity therefore , bacteria have less chance to evade the immune system and to colonize host tissues glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through camp-capk-mediated inhibition coli and salmonella enterica do not produce ahl signals commonly found in other gram-negative bacteria the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of biofilm , swarming motility , exopolysaccharide production , virulence , and cell aggregation these bacteria can grow within a host without harming it until they reach a threshold concentration another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition also show quorum sensing activity shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity all isolates produced the two principal ahls , n-butanoylhomoserine lactone ( c4-hsl ) and n-hexanoyl homoserine lactone ( c6-hsl ) in 2002 , the crystal structure of the receptor luxp of vibrio harveyi with its inducer ai-2 ( which is one of the few biomolecules containing boron ) bound to it was also determined researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria ( '' quorum quenching '' ) additionally , researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds ( such as caffeine ) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors research in this area has been promising and could lead to the development of natural compounds as effective therapeutics this result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome a recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer would be unlikely to have integrated itself to this degree in quorum sensing genes of gammaproteobacteria , which includes pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli , the luxi/luxr genes form a functional pair , with luxi as the auto-inducer synthase and luxr as the receptor quorum quenching is the process of preventing quorum sensing by disrupting signalling those bacteria produce 3-oxo-hsl quorum sensing molecules several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making honey bees ( apis mellifera ) also use quorum sensing to make decisions about new nest sites quorum sensing has been engineered using synthetic biological circuits in different systems dedicated issue of philosophical transactions b on quorum sensing ( 2007 )

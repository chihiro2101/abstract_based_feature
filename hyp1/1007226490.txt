quorum sensing was first reported in 1970 , by kenneth nealson , terry platt , and j these bacteria did not synthesize luciferase—and therefore did not luminesce—in freshly inoculated culture but only after the bacterial population had increased significantly because they attributed this conditioning of the medium to the growing population of cells itself , they referred to the phenomenon as autoinducer some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of bacteria bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain phenotype expressions , which in turn , coordinate their behaviours some common phenotypes include biofilm formation , virulence factor expression , and motility certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate bioluminescence , nitrogen fixation and spore the quorum-sensing function is based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria use quorum sensing , but there are some major differences in their mechanisms for the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively , they must possess three characteristics : to secrete a signaling molecule , an autoinducer , to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules , and to regulate gene transcription as a response at high cell density , the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level , and trigger changes in gene expression the kinase phosphorylates a transcription factor , which regulates gene transcription gram-negative bacteria produce n-acyl homoserine lactone ( ahl ) as their signaling molecule some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well however , when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore ( about cells/ml ) , transcription of luciferase is induced , leading to bioluminescence fischeri bioluminescence is regulated by ahls ( n-acyl-homoserine lactones ) which is a product of the luxi gene whose transcription is regulated by the luxr activator as mentioned before , ahl are the quorum sensing molecules of gram-negative bacteria , which means curvibacter has a quorum sensing activity indeed , due to the oxidoreductase activity of hydra , there is a modification of ahl signalling molecules ( 3-oxo-homoserine lactone into 3-hydroxy-homoserine lactone ) which leads to a different host-microbe interaction coli ) , cell division may be partially regulated by ai-2-mediated quorum sensing part of it encodes an abc transporter , which imports ai-2 into the cells during the early stationery ( latent ) phase of growth glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through camp-capk-mediated inhibition coli and salmonella enterica do not produce ahl signals commonly found in other gram-negative bacteria however , they have a receptor that detects ahls from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other '' quorate '' populations of gram-negative bacteria when ahl is detected , sdia regulates the rck operon on the salmonella virulence plasmid ( pefi-srgd-srga-srgb-rck-srgc ) and a single gene horizontal acquisition in the chromosome srge salmonella does not detect ahl when passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of several animal species , suggesting that the normal microbiota does not produce ahls these bacteria can grow within a host without harming it until they reach a threshold concentration another form of gene regulation that allows the bacteria to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling disrupting the signaling process in this way is called quorum sensing inhibition it produces ahls and also , it can degrade the ahl molecules as well the yenr and yeni proteins produced by the gammaproteobacterium yersinia enterocolitica are similar to aliivibrio fischeri luxr and luxi yens inhibits yeni expression and acylhomoserine lactone production coli , an enteric bacterium and model organism for gram-negative bacteria , produce ai-2 mbtl is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount additionally , researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds ( such as caffeine ) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors this result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome as mentioned before , n-acyl-homoserine lactones ( ahl ) are the quorum sensing signaling molecules of the gram-negative bacteria those bacteria produce 3-oxo-hsl quorum sensing molecules the quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by temnothorax ants in several ways once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number ( usually 10–20 bees ) has been reached , they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping

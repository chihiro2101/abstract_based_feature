beyond the fact that he was born in smithfield , london , into the welsh speaking family of inigo jones snr , a welsh cloth worker , and baptised at the church of st bartholomew-the-less , little is known about jones 's early years jones first became famous as a designer of costumes and stage settings , especially after he brought '' masques '' to the stage between 1605 and 1640 , he was responsible for staging over 500 performances , collaborating with ben jonson for many years , despite a relationship fraught with competition and jealousy : the two had arguments about whether stage design or literature was more important in theatre ( jonson ridiculed jones in a series of his works , written over a span of two decades jonson 's follower richard brome also took a swipe at jones in the weeding of covent garden , inigo jones and the theatre of the stuart court , 1973 and understanding of italian set design , particularly that of alfonso and giulio parigi jones learned to speak italian fluently and there is evidence that he owned an italian copy of andrea palladio 's i quattro libri dell'architettura with marginalia that refer to wotton jones 's first recorded architectural design is for a monument to frances , lady cotton , commissioned by rowland cotton , circa 1608–1611 , giles worsley , inigo jones and the european classical tradition ( yale , 2007 ) , pp & nbsp ; 360+ in july 1606 jones made scenery for a masque at theobalds for the earl of salisbury paul 's cathedral , displaying a similar practical architectural inexperience and immature handling of themes from sources including palladio , serlio and sangallo his annotated copy of palladio 's quattro libri dell'architettura also demonstrates his close interest in classical architecture : jones gave priority to roman antiquity rather than observing the contemporary fashion in italy he was probably the first englishman to study these roman remains first hand and this was key to the new architecture jones introduced in england in 1616 , work began on the queen 's house , greenwich , for james i 's wife , anne it was finished in 1635 as the first strictly classical building in england , employing ideas found in the architecture of palladio and ancient rome the whitehall palace was one of several projects where jones worked with his personal assistant and nephew by marriage john webb these buildings show the realisation of a mature architect with a confident grasp of classical principles and an intellectual understanding of how to implement them the other project in which jones was involved is the design of covent garden square he was commissioned by the earl of bedford to build a residential square , which he did along the lines of the italian piazza of livorno in the design of st paul 's , jones faithfully adhered to vitruvius 's design for a tuscan temple and it was the first wholly and authentically classical church built in england jones also designed the square of lincoln 's inn fields , and a house in the square , the lindsey house built in 1640 , is often attributed to jones between the years of 1634 and 1642 , jones wrestled with the dilapidated gothicism of old st paul 's , casing it in classical masonry and totally redesigning the west front jones incorporated the giant scrolls from vignola and della porta 's church of the gesù with a giant corinthian portico , the largest of its type north of the alps , but was destroyed in the great fire of london in 1666 also around this time , circa 1638 , jones devised drawings completely redesigning the palace of whitehall , but the execution of these designs was frustrated by charles i 's financial and political difficulties stoke bruerne park in northamptonshire was built by sir francis crane , '' receiving the assistance of inigo jones '' , between 1629 and 1635 one of jones 's design work was '' double cube '' room , and it was also the foundation stone of his status as the father of british architecture a monument dedicated to him in the church , ironically portraying st paul 's cathedral and other buildings , was destroyed in the great fire in 1666 , inigo jones : the theatre of the stuart court , 1973 giles worsley , inigo jones and the european classicist tradition , new haven and london , yale university press , 2007 843 , june 1973 inigo jones at the national portrait gallery , london h

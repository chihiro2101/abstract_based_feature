at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act in the early 1980s , in certain police constabularies , notably greater manchester police which was at that time run by devout christian chief constable james anderton , police raids on video hire shops increased the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification such permission was not always granted , and in the case of the release of the exorcist in 1973 , a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen abel ferrara : the king of new york whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term '' video nasty '' amid the growing concern , the sunday times brought the issue to a wider audience in may 1982 with an article entitled '' how high street horror is invading the home '' the exposure of '' nasties '' to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 this was passed as the video recordings act 1984 which came into effect on 1 september 1985 effects of the video recordings act 1984 under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases all video releases after 1 september 1985 had to comply with the act and be submitted for classification by the bbfc films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified however , the board did loosen its standards , especially at the 18 level , in response to public consultation in 2000 the departure of james ferman from the bbfc may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time stop this debasing film -times online this coincided with an attempt by mps julian brazier and keith vaz to pass a law allowing mps greater powers to tighten bbfc guidelines or force an appeal of a release however , the uk government passed a law criminalising possession of '' extreme pornography '' whilst bbfc-rated films are exempt from the legislation , screenshots from these same bbfc-rated movies are not , and would also apply to unrated films hostel : part ii was cited in the house of commons as an example of a film where screenshots could become illegal to possess 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing in the majority of cases below where cuts were made , they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women , both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the bbfc a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s 39 of the section 2 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material antropophagus (

at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings the bbfc had been established in 1912 , essentially as an unintended consequence of the cinematograph act 1909 , and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the united kingdom ( though local councils were the final arbiters ) as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification such permission was not always granted , and in the case of the release of the exorcist in 1973 , a number of enterprising managers of cinemas where permission had been granted set about providing buses to transport cinema-goers from other localities where the film could not be seen whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term '' video nasty '' amid the growing concern , the sunday times brought the issue to a wider audience in may 1982 with an article entitled '' how high street horror is invading the home '' soon the daily mail began their own campaign against the distribution of these films the exposure of '' nasties '' to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths the growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 this was passed as the video recordings act 1984 which came into effect on 1 september 1985 effects of the video recordings act 1984 all video releases after 1 september 1985 had to comply with the act and be submitted for classification by the bbfc films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' as well as not passing any film liable to be found obscene , the bbfc imposed additional bans and cuts on films such as the texas chain saw massacre the departure of james ferman from the bbfc may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time the exorcist was granted an uncut 18 video certificate on 25 february 1999 , followed by the texas chain saw massacre in august , and several official '' nasties '' were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed in 2008 , there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the bbfc , in particular ss experiment camp stop this debasing film -times online this coincided with an attempt by mps julian brazier and keith vaz to pass a law allowing mps greater powers to tighten bbfc guidelines or force an appeal of a release however , the uk government passed a law criminalising possession of '' extreme pornography '' whilst bbfc-rated films are exempt from the legislation , screenshots from these same bbfc-rated movies are not , and would also apply to unrated films hostel : part ii was cited in the house of commons as an example of a film where screenshots could become illegal to possess the dpp list of '' video nasties '' was first made public in june 1983 in total , 72 separate films appeared on the list at one time or another 10 films remain banned in the uk because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing ultimately , the list became obsolete when the video recordings act came into force , and since 2001 , several of the films have been released uncut in the majority of cases below where cuts were made , they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women , both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the bbfc a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s unless noted otherwise , all films that have been released have been rated 18 any title seized under section 2 would make the dealer or distributor liable to prosecution for disseminating obscene materials dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed 39 of the section 2 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned 33 of the section 2 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto section 3 section 3 titles were liable to be confiscated under a '' less obscene '' charge , which allowed the police to seize a film they considered obscene and as long as the dealer cooperated , they legally admit that the articles are obscene and therefore escape any personal prosecution the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material section 1 : prosecuted films

at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act in the early 1980s , in certain police constabularies , notably greater manchester police which was at that time run by devout christian chief constable james anderton , police raids on video hire shops increased the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated the dpp recognised that the current system , where the interpretation of obscenity was down to individual chief constables , was inconsistent and decided to publish a list that contained names of films that had already resulted in a successful prosecution or where the dpp had already filed charges against the video 's distributors this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings the bbfc had been established in 1912 , essentially as an unintended consequence of the cinematograph act 1909 , and it was their responsibility to pass films intended for the cinema for certification within the united kingdom ( though local councils were the final arbiters ) as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification amid the growing concern , the sunday times brought the issue to a wider audience in may 1982 with an article entitled '' how high street horror is invading the home '' the exposure of '' nasties '' to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths the growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act similarly straw dogs was denied video certification and removed from video stores popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex neil innes ' song '' my new school '' ( 1984 ) contains a video nasty reference '' it 's got all the charm of a video nasty/i 've never been anywhere so ghastly , my new school '' with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified the departure of james ferman from the bbfc may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time the exorcist was granted an uncut 18 video certificate on 25 february 1999 , followed by the texas chain saw massacre in august , and several official '' nasties '' were passed in the early 2000s either uncut or with cuts restricted to sexual violence or actual animals being harmed in 2008 , there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the bbfc , in particular ss experiment camp whilst bbfc-rated films are exempt from the legislation , screenshots from these same bbfc-rated movies are not , and would also apply to unrated films the dpp list of '' video nasties '' was first made public in june 1983 10 films remain banned in the uk because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed 33 of the section 2 films had unsuccessful prosecutions and were subsequently dropped from the list and placed onto section 3 the 33 films that could n't be prosecuted under section 2 automatically became section 3 titles and were still seized by the police the beast in heat ( original title : la bestia in calore , also known as ss hell camp ) – no uk re-release blood rites ( also known as the ghastly ones ) – no uk

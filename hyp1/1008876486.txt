at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act in the early 1980s , in certain police constabularies , notably greater manchester police which was at that time run by devout christian chief constable james anderton , police raids on video hire shops increased the video retailers association were alarmed by the apparently random seizures and asked the dpp to provide a guideline for the industry so that stockists could be made aware of the titles which were liable to be confiscated this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 this was passed as the video recordings act 1984 which came into effect on 1 september 1985 under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video the supply of unclassified videos became a criminal offence , as did supplying 15 and 18 certificate videos to under-aged people in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 similarly straw dogs was denied video certification and removed from video stores popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified among modern films , many , such as the hostel and saw series , contain brutal , graphic violence but have passed through uncut hostel : part ii was cited in the house of commons as an example of a film where screenshots could become illegal to possess 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing in the majority of cases below where cuts were made , they were scenes of real-life animal cruelty and/or excessive violence to women , both of which are still regarded with some degree of severity by the bbfc unless noted otherwise , all films that have been released have been rated 18 dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed the 33 films that could n't be prosecuted under section 2 automatically became section 3 titles and were still seized by the police the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material absurd ( original title : rosso sangue , also known as monster hunter , anthropophagus 2 , and horrible ) -

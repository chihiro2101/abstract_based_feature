at the time of the introduction of domestic video recorders in the united kingdom during the 1970s , there was no legislation specifically designed to regulate video content , apart from the obscene publications act 1959 which had been amended in 1977 to cover erotic films major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' the lack of regulation of the domestic video market was in sharp contrast to the regulation of material intended for public screenings whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term '' video nasty '' soon the daily mail began their own campaign against the distribution of these films the exposure of '' nasties '' to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths the growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 this was passed as the video recordings act 1984 which came into effect on 1 september 1985 under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases the increased possibility of videos falling into the hands of children required that film classification for video be a separate process from cinema classification films that had passed uncut for cinema release were often cut for video as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 similarly straw dogs was denied video certification and removed from video stores in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex the television programme spitting image parodied the video nasties with their sketch of a sickeningly nice , low-budget film entitled a video '' nicie '' however , the board did loosen its standards , especially at the 18 level , in response to public consultation in 2000 the departure of james ferman from the bbfc may also have allowed some long-proscribed films to be re-appraised around this time in 2008 , there was another brief media frenzy over such films that had years earlier been approved for release by the bbfc , in particular ss experiment camp mps press for ban on ss camp ‘ video nasty ’ the bill failed to pass 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc 10 films remain banned in the uk because they have not yet been resubmitted for classification by any distributors or have been rejected for classification a number of films spent a short time on this list because their prosecutions failed shortly after publication or because it was decided that prosecution was not worth pursuing ultimately , the list became obsolete when the video recordings act came into force , and since 2001 , several of the films have been released uncut a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s the dpp list is divided into two sections : section 2 and section 3 any title seized under section 2 would make the dealer or distributor liable to prosecution for disseminating obscene materials the 33 films that could n't be prosecuted under section 2 automatically became section 3 titles and were still seized by the police the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material complete version passed uncut in june 2015 released with 19 seconds cut in

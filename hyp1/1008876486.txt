major film distributors were initially reluctant to embrace the new medium of video for fear of piracy and the video market became flooded with low-budget horror films whilst some of these films had been passed by the british board of film censors ( bbfc ) for cinema release , others had been refused certification which effectively banned them the obscene publications act defined obscenity as that which may '' tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely , having regard to all relevant circumstances , to read , see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it '' if the director of public prosecutions ( dpp ) felt that a certain video might be in breach of the act , then a prosecution could be brought against the film 's producers , distributors and retailers however , under the terms of the act the police were empowered to seize videos from retailers if they were of the opinion that the material was in breach of the act this list became known as the dpp list of '' video nasties '' as part of this process the board could recommend , or demand in the more extreme cases , that certain cuts be made to the film in order for it to gain a particular certification whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term '' video nasty '' soon the daily mail began their own campaign against the distribution of these films the growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents at the suggestion of the national viewers ' and listeners ' association , the conservative mp graham bright introduced a private member 's bill to the house of commons in 1983 this was passed as the video recordings act 1984 which came into effect on 1 september 1985 effects of the video recordings act 1984 under the 1984 act , the british board of film censors was renamed the british board of film classification and became responsible for the certification of both cinema and video releases all video releases after 1 september 1985 had to comply with the act and be submitted for classification by the bbfc films released on video before that date had to be re-submitted for classification within the following three years the supply of unclassified videos became a criminal offence , as did supplying 15 and 18 certificate videos to under-aged people as well as the low-budget horror films the act was originally intended to curb , a number of high-profile films which had passed cinema certification fell foul of the act in particular , the exorcist , which was made available by warner home video in december 1981 , was not submitted for video certification by the bbfc and was withdrawn from shelves in 1986 popular culture backlash against the video recordings act included the may 1984 release of '' nasty '' by the punk-goth outfit the damned , who celebrated the condemned genre with the lyrics '' i fell in love with a video nasty '' in another episode , '' bambi '' , the eponymous character had apparently done a '' disney nasty '' entitled bambi goes crazy-ape bonkers with his drill and sex with the passing of the video recordings act , the films on the list could be prosecuted for both obscenity and not being classified among modern films , many , such as the hostel and saw series , contain brutal , graphic violence but have passed through uncut mps press for ban on ss camp ‘ video nasty ’ the bill failed to pass hostel : part ii was cited in the house of commons as an example of a film where screenshots could become illegal to possess 39 films were successfully prosecuted under the obscene publications act but some of these films have been subsequently cut and then approved for release by the bbfc ultimately , the list became obsolete when the video recordings act came into force , and since 2001 , several of the films have been released uncut a large number of these movies caused additional controversy with the cover art of the original big box releases seen in the video shops of the early 1980s unless noted otherwise , all films that have been released have been rated 18 the dpp list is divided into two sections : section 2 and section 3 dealers could be fined or jailed and the film itself would be declared obscene if the prosecution was successful , meaning it could not be distributed or sold in the uk until the obscenity was quashed 39 of the section 2 films were successfully prosecuted and remained banned the 33 films that could n't be prosecuted under section 2 automatically became section 3 titles and were still seized by the police the main difference between section 2 and 3 is that video dealers or distributors could be personally prosecuted in court for holding the film under section 2 but not under section 3 , where the obscenity is admitted through forfeiting the material section 1 : prosecuted films released with 19 seconds cut in 1999 released with 43 seconds cut in 1994 blood feast – released with 23 seconds cut in 2001 released with

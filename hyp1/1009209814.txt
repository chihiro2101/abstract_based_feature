the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover it was considered formal wear and was generally reserved for citizens the romans considered it unique to themselves , thus their poetic description by virgil and martial as the gens togata ( 'toga-wearing race ' ) there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium toga praetexta : a white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border , worn over a tunic with two broad , vertical purple stripes livy , xxvii.8,8 and xxxiii.42 ( as cited by the dictionary of greek and roman antiquities ) toga candida : '' bright toga '' ; a toga rubbed with chalk to a dazzling white , worn by candidates ( from latin candida , '' pure white '' ) for public office toga pulla : a '' dark toga '' was supposed to be worn by mourning at elite funerals . wearing a toga pulla at the feast that ended mourning was irreligious , ignorant , or plain bad manners cicero makes a distinction between the toga pulla and an ordinary toga deliberately '' dirtied '' by its wearer as a legitimate mark of protest or supplication . toga picta ( '' painted toga '' ) : dyed solid purple , decorated with imagery in gold thread , and worn over a similarly-decorated tunica palmata ; used by generals in their triumphs it may have been a shorter form of toga , or a cloak , wrap or sash worn over a toga more certainly , equites wore an angusticlavia , a tunic with narrow , vertical purple stripes , at least one of which would have been visible when worn with a toga or trabea , whatever its form . as '' national dress '' roman historians believed that rome 's legendary founder and first king , the erstwhile shepherd romulus , had worn a toga as his clothing of choice ; the purple-bordered toga praetexta was supposedly used by etruscan magistrates , and introduced to rome by her third king , tullus hostilius roman society was strongly hierarchical , stratified and competitive magistrates were elected by their peers and '' the people '' ; in roman constitutional theory , they ruled by consent the plebeian who made up the vast majority of the roman electorate had limited influence on politics , unless barracking or voting en masse , or through representation by their tribunes togas were relatively uniform in pattern and style but varied significantly in the quality and quantity of their fabric , and the marks of higher rank or office the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage , and adopted the stola senatorial versions were expensively laundered to an exceptional , snowy white ; those of lower ranking citizens were a duller shade , more cheaply laundered citizenship carried specific privileges , rights and responsibilities respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office citizenship could be inherited , granted , up or down-graded , and removed for specific offences the formula togatorum ( '' list of toga-wearers '' ) listed the various military obligations that rome 's socii were required to supply to rome in times of war . in roman territories , the toga was explicitly forbidden to non-citizens ; to foreigners , freedmen , and slaves ; to roman exiles ; exiles were deprived of citizenship and the protection of roman law . a freedman or foreigner might pose as a togate citizen , or a common citizen as an equestrian ; such pretenders were sometimes ferreted out in the census formal seating arrangements in public theatres and circuses reflected the dominance of rome 's togate elect senators sat at the very front , equites behind them , common citizens behind equites ; and so on , through the non-togate mass of freedmen , foreigners , and slaves he promptly heads for rome every male roman citizen was entitled to wear some kind of toga â€“ martial refers to a lesser citizen 's '' small toga '' and a poor man 's '' little toga '' ( both togula ) , conversely , the costly , full-length toga seems to have been a rather awkward mark of distinction when worn by '' the wrong sort '' most citizens who owned a toga would have cherished it as a costly material object , and worn it when they must for special occasions only a higher-class roman , a magistrate , would have had lictors to clear his way , and even then , wearing a toga was a challenge the toga 's apparent natural simplicity and '' elegant , flowing lines '' were the result of diligent practice and cultivation ; to avoid an embarrassing disarrangement of its folds , its wearer had to walk with measured , stately gait , if he moved too slowly , he might seem aimless , '' sluggish of mind '' - or , worst of all , '' womanly '' like the empire itself , the peace that the toga came to represent had been earned through the extraordinary and unremitting collective efforts of its citizens , who could therefore claim '' the time and dignity to dress in such a way '' cash-strapped or debtor citizens with a respectable lineage might have to seek patronage from rich freedmen , who ranked as inferiors and non-citizens . citizen-clients were expected to wear the toga appropriate to their status , and to wear it correctly and smartly or risk affront to their host by the time he had presented his case , the orator was likely to be hot and sweaty ; but even this could be employed to good effect meretrices might have been expected or perhaps compelled , at least in public , to wear the '' female toga '' ( toga muliebris ) an adulterous matron betrayed her family and reputation ; and if found guilty , and divorced , the law forbade her remarriage to a roman citizen when worn by a woman in this later era , the toga would have been a '' blatant display '' of her '' exclusion from the respectable roman hierarchy '' citizens attending rome 's frequent roman festivals and associated ludi were expected to wear the toga such inconvenient features of the later toga are confirmed by tertullian , who preferred the pallium

the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium it represented adult male citizenship and its attendant rights , freedoms and responsibilities toga praetexta : a white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border , worn over a tunic with two broad , vertical purple stripes a praetexta was thought effective against malignant magic , as were a boy 's bulla , and a girl 's lunula . not all modern scholarship agrees that girls wore the toga praetexta ; see toga candida : '' bright toga '' ; a toga rubbed with chalk to a dazzling white , worn by candidates ( from latin candida , '' pure white '' ) for public office toga pulla : a '' dark toga '' was supposed to be worn by mourning at elite funerals cicero makes a distinction between the toga pulla and an ordinary toga deliberately '' dirtied '' by its wearer as a legitimate mark of protest or supplication . toga picta ( '' painted toga '' ) : dyed solid purple , decorated with imagery in gold thread , and worn over a similarly-decorated tunica palmata ; used by generals in their triumphs trabea , associated with citizens of equites ; thus their description as trabeati in some contemporary roman literature in the later imperial era , trabea refers to elaborate forms of consular dress some later roman and post-roman sources describe it as solid purple or red , either identifying or confusing it with the dress worn by the ancient roman kings ( also used to clothe images of the gods ) or reflecting changes in the trabea itself more certainly , equites wore an angusticlavia , a tunic with narrow , vertical purple stripes , at least one of which would have been visible when worn with a toga or trabea , whatever its form a lost work by suetonius describes it as a toga made '' duplex '' ( doubled by folding over upon itself ) . as '' national dress '' the toga 's most distinguishing feature was its semi-circular shape , which sets it apart from other cloaks of antiquity like the greek himation or pallium the plebeian who made up the vast majority of the roman electorate had limited influence on politics , unless barracking or voting en masse , or through representation by their tribunes togas were relatively uniform in pattern and style but varied significantly in the quality and quantity of their fabric , and the marks of higher rank or office the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates it was colour-fast , extremely expensive and the '' most talked-about colour in greco-roman antiquity '' the purple-bordered praetexta worn by freeborn youths acknowledged their vulnerability and sanctity in law young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage , and adopted the stola : a minority of young girls seem to have used the praetexta , perhaps because their parents embraced the self-conscious revivalism typified in augustan legislation and mores senatorial versions were expensively laundered to an exceptional , snowy white ; those of lower ranking citizens were a duller shade , more cheaply laundered respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office togati , '' those who wear the toga , '' is not precisely equivalent to '' roman citizens , '' and may mean more broadly '' romanized '' . in roman territories , the toga was explicitly forbidden to non-citizens ; to foreigners , freedmen , and slaves ; to roman exiles ; exiles were deprived of citizenship and the protection of roman law . a freedman or foreigner might pose as a togate citizen , or a common citizen as an equestrian ; such pretenders were sometimes ferreted out in the census formal seating arrangements in public theatres and circuses reflected the dominance of rome 's togate elect senators sat at the very front , equites behind them , common citizens behind equites ; and so on , through the non-togate mass of freedmen , foreigners , and slaves women probably sat or stood at the very back – apart from the sacred vestals , who had their own box at the front the cost of a new , simple hooded cloak , using far less material than a toga , might represent three fifths of an individual 's annual minimum subsistence cost : see : contra goldman 's description of roman clothing , including the toga , as '' simple and elegant , practical and comfortable '' in only a higher-class roman , a magistrate , would have had lictors to clear his way , and even then , wearing a toga was a challenge . vout ( 1996 ) suggests that the toga 's most challenging qualities as garment fitted the romans ' view of themselves and their civilization a good patron offered advancement , security , honour , wealth , government contracts and other business opportunities to his client , who might be further down in the social or economic scale , or more rarely , his equal or superior cash-strapped or debtor citizens with a respectable lineage might have to seek patronage from rich freedmen , who ranked as inferiors and non-citizens clients seeking patronage had to attend the patron 's early-morning formal salutatio ( '' greeting session '' ) , held in the semi-public , grand reception room ( atrium ) of his family house ( domus ) . citizen-clients were expected to wear the toga appropriate to their status , and to wear it correctly and smartly or risk affront to their host . martial and his friend juvenal suffered the system as clients for years , and found the whole business demeaning even as a satirical analogy , the equation of togate client and slave would have shocked those who cherished the toga as a symbol of personal dignity and auctoritas – a meaning underlined during the saturnalia festival , when the toga was '' very consciously put aside '' , in a ritualised , strictly limited inversion of the master-slave relationship '' if , on the other hand , the '' toga falls down at the beginning of our speech , or when we have only proceeded but a little way , the failure to replace it is a sign of indifference , or sloth , or sheer ignorance of the way in which clothes should be worn '' until the marian reforms of 107 bc , the lower ranks of rome 's military forces were '' farmer-soldiers '' , a militia of citizen smallholders conscripted for the duration of hostilities , a traditional , high-status mater familias demonstrated her industry and frugality by placing wool-baskets , spindles and looms in the household 's semi-public reception area , the atrium . the umbo ( literally '' knob '' ) was a pouch of the toga 's fabric pulled out over the balteus ( the diagonal section of the toga across the chest ) in imperial-era forms of the toga

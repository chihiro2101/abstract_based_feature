the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover it was considered formal wear and was generally reserved for citizens there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium toga praetexta : a white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border , worn over a tunic with two broad , vertical purple stripes it was formal costume for : imperium in their official functions , and traditionally , the kings of rome livy , xxvii.8,8 and xxxiii.42 ( as cited by the dictionary of greek and roman antiquities ) toga candida : '' bright toga '' ; a toga rubbed with chalk to a dazzling white , worn by candidates ( from latin candida , '' pure white '' ) for public office toga pulla : a '' dark toga '' was supposed to be worn by mourning at elite funerals a toga praetexta was also acceptable as mourning wear , if turned inside out to conceal its stripe ; so was a plain toga pura cicero makes a distinction between the toga pulla and an ordinary toga deliberately '' dirtied '' by its wearer as a legitimate mark of protest or supplication trabea , associated with citizens of equites ; thus their description as trabeati in some contemporary roman literature it may have been a shorter form of toga , or a cloak , wrap or sash worn over a toga more certainly , equites wore an angusticlavia , a tunic with narrow , vertical purple stripes , at least one of which would have been visible when worn with a toga or trabea , whatever its form a lost work by suetonius describes it as a toga made '' duplex '' ( doubled by folding over upon itself ) the toga 's most distinguishing feature was its semi-circular shape , which sets it apart from other cloaks of antiquity like the greek himation or pallium the rounded form suggests it evolved out of the semi-circular etruscan tebenna roman society was strongly hierarchical , stratified and competitive in practice , they were a mutually competitive oligarchy , reserving the greatest power , wealth and prestige for their class despite often extreme disparities of wealth and rank between the citizen classes , the toga identified them as a singular and exclusive civic body the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates the purple-bordered praetexta worn by freeborn youths acknowledged their vulnerability and sanctity in law once a boy came of age ( usually at puberty ) he adopted the plain white toga virilis ; this meant that he was free to set up his own household , marry , and vote young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage , and adopted the stola even the whiteness of the toga virilis was subject to class distinction togati , '' those who wear the toga , '' is not precisely equivalent to '' roman citizens , '' and may mean more broadly '' romanized '' . a freedman or foreigner might pose as a togate citizen , or a common citizen as an equestrian ; such pretenders were sometimes ferreted out in the census women probably sat or stood at the very back â€“ apart from the sacred vestals , who had their own box at the front . various anecdotes reflect the toga 's symbolic value . rome 's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all rome 's great men wore togas , and must always have done so traditionalists idealised rome 's urban and rustic citizenry as descendants of a hardy , virtuous , toga-clad peasantry , but the toga 's bulk and complex drapery made it entirely impractical for manual work or physically active leisure the toga was heavy , '' unwieldy , excessively hot , easily stained , and hard to launder '' . it was best suited to stately processions , public debate and oratory , sitting in the theatre or circus , and displaying oneself before one 's peers and inferiors while '' ostentatiously doing nothing '' ; throughout the empire , there is evidence that old clothing was recycled , repaired and handed down the social scale , from one owner to the next , until it fell to rags the cost of a new , simple hooded cloak , using far less material than a toga , might represent three fifths of an individual 's annual minimum subsistence cost : see conversely , the costly , full-length toga seems to have been a rather awkward mark of distinction when worn by '' the wrong sort '' the poet horace writes '' of a rich ex-slave 'parading from end to end of the via sacra in a toga three yards long ' to show off his new status and wealth most citizens who owned a toga would have cherished it as a costly material object , and worn it when they must for special occasions family , friendships and alliances , and the gainful pursuit of wealth through business and trade would have been their major preoccupations , not the otium ( cultured leisure ) claimed as a right by the elite : contra goldman 's description of roman clothing , including the toga , as '' simple and elegant , practical and comfortable '' in . rank , reputation and romanitas were paramount , even in death , so almost invariably , a male citizen 's memorial image showed him clad in his toga clients were many , and those of least interest to the patron had to scrabble for notice among the '' togate horde '' ( turbae togatae ) along with their toga , striped tunic and formal shoes ( or calcei ) , this signified their status when worn by a woman in this later era , the toga would have been a '' blatant display '' of her '' exclusion from the respectable roman hierarchy '' the toga praetexta was the normal garb for most roman priesthoods , which tended to be the preserve of high status citizens . the umbo ( literally '' knob '' ) was a pouch of the toga 's fabric pulled out over the balteus ( the diagonal section of the toga across the chest ) in imperial-era forms of the toga . hadrian issued an edict compelling equites and senators to wear the toga in public ; the edict did not mention commoners

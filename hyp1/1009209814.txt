the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover it was considered formal wear and was generally reserved for citizens the romans considered it unique to themselves , thus their poetic description by virgil and martial as the gens togata ( 'toga-wearing race ' ) there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium toga praetexta : a white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border , worn over a tunic with two broad , vertical purple stripes it was formal costume for : imperium in their official functions , and traditionally , the kings of rome a praetexta was thought effective against malignant magic , as were a boy 's bulla , and a girl 's lunula toga pulla : a '' dark toga '' was supposed to be worn by mourning at elite funerals a toga praetexta was also acceptable as mourning wear , if turned inside out to conceal its stripe ; so was a plain toga pura . wearing a toga pulla at the feast that ended mourning was irreligious , ignorant , or plain bad manners . toga picta ( '' painted toga '' ) : dyed solid purple , decorated with imagery in gold thread , and worn over a similarly-decorated tunica palmata ; used by generals in their triumphs trabea , associated with citizens of equites ; thus their description as trabeati in some contemporary roman literature it may have been a shorter form of toga , or a cloak , wrap or sash worn over a toga in the later imperial era , trabea refers to elaborate forms of consular dress some later roman and post-roman sources describe it as solid purple or red , either identifying or confusing it with the dress worn by the ancient roman kings ( also used to clothe images of the gods ) or reflecting changes in the trabea itself laena , a long , heavy cloak worn by flamen priesthoods , fastened at the shoulder with a brooch in practice , they were a mutually competitive oligarchy , reserving the greatest power , wealth and prestige for their class despite often extreme disparities of wealth and rank between the citizen classes , the toga identified them as a singular and exclusive civic body togas were relatively uniform in pattern and style but varied significantly in the quality and quantity of their fabric , and the marks of higher rank or office the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates tyrian purple was supposedly reserved for the toga picta , the border of the toga praetexta , and elements of the priestly dress worn by the inviolate vestal virgins once a boy came of age ( usually at puberty ) he adopted the plain white toga virilis ; this meant that he was free to set up his own household , marry , and vote young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage , and adopted the stola even the whiteness of the toga virilis was subject to class distinction senatorial versions were expensively laundered to an exceptional , snowy white ; those of lower ranking citizens were a duller shade , more cheaply laundered respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office the formula togatorum ( '' list of toga-wearers '' ) listed the various military obligations that rome 's socii were required to supply to rome in times of war togati , '' those who wear the toga , '' is not precisely equivalent to '' roman citizens , '' and may mean more broadly '' romanized '' . in roman territories , the toga was explicitly forbidden to non-citizens ; to foreigners , freedmen , and slaves ; to roman exiles ; exiles were deprived of citizenship and the protection of roman law and to men of infamia or shameful reputation ; an individual 's status should be discernable at a glance formal seating arrangements in public theatres and circuses reflected the dominance of rome 's togate elect senators sat at the very front , equites behind them , common citizens behind equites ; and so on , through the non-togate mass of freedmen , foreigners , and slaves then he is told that he has been appointed dictator . donning the toga transforms cincinnatus from rustic , sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless , of impeccable stock and reputation – into rome 's leading politician , eager to serve his country ; a top-quality roman . rome 's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all rome 's great men wore togas , and must always have done so . it was best suited to stately processions , public debate and oratory , sitting in the theatre or circus , and displaying oneself before one 's peers and inferiors while '' ostentatiously doing nothing '' every male roman citizen was entitled to wear some kind of toga – martial refers to a lesser citizen 's '' small toga '' and a poor man 's '' little toga '' ( both togula ) , ; throughout the empire , there is evidence that old clothing was recycled , repaired and handed down the social scale , from one owner to the next , until it fell to rags the poet horace writes '' of a rich ex-slave 'parading from end to end of the via sacra in a toga three yards long ' to show off his new status and wealth most citizens who owned a toga would have cherished it as a costly material object , and worn it when they must for special occasions . citizen-clients were expected to wear the toga appropriate to their status , and to wear it correctly and smartly or risk affront to their host '' if , on the other hand , the '' toga falls down at the beginning of our speech , or when we have only proceeded but a little way , the failure to replace it is a sign of indifference , or sloth , or sheer ignorance of the way in which clothes should be worn '' when worn by a woman in this later era , the toga would have been a '' blatant display '' of her '' exclusion from the respectable roman hierarchy '' augustus was particularly proud that his wife and daughter had set the best possible example to other roman women by , allegedly , spinning and weaving his clothing . the umbo ( literally '' knob '' ) was a pouch of the toga 's fabric pulled out over the balteus ( the diagonal section of the toga across the chest ) in imperial-era forms of the toga the toga nevertheless remained the formal costume of the roman senatorial elite

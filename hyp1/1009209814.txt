the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover it was considered formal wear and was generally reserved for citizens there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium toga praetexta : a white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border , worn over a tunic with two broad , vertical purple stripes it marked their protection by law from sexual predation and immoral or immodest influence . some priesthoods , including the pontifices , epulones , the augurs , and the arval brethren toga candida : '' bright toga '' ; a toga rubbed with chalk to a dazzling white , worn by candidates ( from latin candida , '' pure white '' ) for public office toga pulla : a '' dark toga '' was supposed to be worn by mourning at elite funerals a toga praetexta was also acceptable as mourning wear , if turned inside out to conceal its stripe ; so was a plain toga pura . wearing a toga pulla at the feast that ended mourning was irreligious , ignorant , or plain bad manners . toga picta ( '' painted toga '' ) : dyed solid purple , decorated with imagery in gold thread , and worn over a similarly-decorated tunica palmata ; used by generals in their triumphs over time , it became increasingly elaborate , and was combined with elements of the consular trabea trabea , associated with citizens of equites ; thus their description as trabeati in some contemporary roman literature it may have been a shorter form of toga , or a cloak , wrap or sash worn over a toga in the later imperial era , trabea refers to elaborate forms of consular dress some later roman and post-roman sources describe it as solid purple or red , either identifying or confusing it with the dress worn by the ancient roman kings ( also used to clothe images of the gods ) or reflecting changes in the trabea itself more certainly , equites wore an angusticlavia , a tunic with narrow , vertical purple stripes , at least one of which would have been visible when worn with a toga or trabea , whatever its form laena , a long , heavy cloak worn by flamen priesthoods , fastened at the shoulder with a brooch the toga 's most distinguishing feature was its semi-circular shape , which sets it apart from other cloaks of antiquity like the greek himation or pallium despite often extreme disparities of wealth and rank between the citizen classes , the toga identified them as a singular and exclusive civic body the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates tyrian purple was supposedly reserved for the toga picta , the border of the toga praetexta , and elements of the priestly dress worn by the inviolate vestal virgins the purple-bordered praetexta worn by freeborn youths acknowledged their vulnerability and sanctity in law on coming of age , he also gave his protective bulla into the care of the family lares senatorial versions were expensively laundered to an exceptional , snowy white ; those of lower ranking citizens were a duller shade , more cheaply laundered respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office the formula togatorum ( '' list of toga-wearers '' ) listed the various military obligations that rome 's socii were required to supply to rome in times of war togati , '' those who wear the toga , '' is not precisely equivalent to '' roman citizens , '' and may mean more broadly '' romanized '' . in roman territories , the toga was explicitly forbidden to non-citizens ; to foreigners , freedmen , and slaves ; to roman exiles ; exiles were deprived of citizenship and the protection of roman law formal seating arrangements in public theatres and circuses reflected the dominance of rome 's togate elect women probably sat or stood at the very back – apart from the sacred vestals , who had their own box at the front . donning the toga transforms cincinnatus from rustic , sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless , of impeccable stock and reputation – into rome 's leading politician , eager to serve his country ; a top-quality roman . rome 's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all rome 's great men wore togas , and must always have done so the toga was heavy , '' unwieldy , excessively hot , easily stained , and hard to launder '' . it was best suited to stately processions , public debate and oratory , sitting in the theatre or circus , and displaying oneself before one 's peers and inferiors while '' ostentatiously doing nothing '' every male roman citizen was entitled to wear some kind of toga – martial refers to a lesser citizen 's '' small toga '' and a poor man 's '' little toga '' ( both togula ) , ; throughout the empire , there is evidence that old clothing was recycled , repaired and handed down the social scale , from one owner to the next , until it fell to rags centonarii ( '' patch workers '' ) made a living by sewing clothing and other items from recycled fabric patches conversely , the costly , full-length toga seems to have been a rather awkward mark of distinction when worn by '' the wrong sort '' most citizens who owned a toga would have cherished it as a costly material object , and worn it when they must for special occasions the toga 's apparent natural simplicity and '' elegant , flowing lines '' were the result of diligent practice and cultivation ; to avoid an embarrassing disarrangement of its folds , its wearer had to walk with measured , stately gait , he should be well groomed – but not too well ; no primping of the hair , jewellery or any other '' feminine '' perversions of a roman man 's proper appearance its fabric could be old-style rough wool , or new and smoother if preferred – but definitely not silk meretrices might have been expected or perhaps compelled , at least in public , to wear the '' female toga '' ( toga muliebris ) late republican practice and legal reform allowed the creation of standing armies , and opened a military career to any roman citizen or freedman of good reputation . the umbo ( literally '' knob '' ) was a pouch of the toga 's fabric pulled out over the balteus ( the diagonal section of the toga across the chest ) in imperial-era forms of the toga

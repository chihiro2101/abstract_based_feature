the toga was an approximately semi-circular woolen cloth , usually white , worn draped over the left shoulder and around the body : the word '' toga '' probably derives from tegere , to cover it was considered formal wear and was generally reserved for citizens the romans considered it unique to themselves , thus their poetic description by virgil and martial as the gens togata ( 'toga-wearing race ' ) there were many kinds of toga , each reserved by custom to a particular usage or social class ( '' toga of manhood '' ) also known as toga alba or toga pura : a plain white toga , worn on formal occasions by adult male commoners , and by senators not having a imperium toga praetexta : a white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border , worn over a tunic with two broad , vertical purple stripes it was formal costume for : imperium in their official functions , and traditionally , the kings of rome a praetexta was thought effective against malignant magic , as were a boy 's bulla , and a girl 's lunula livy , xxvii.8,8 and xxxiii.42 ( as cited by the dictionary of greek and roman antiquities ) toga candida : '' bright toga '' ; a toga rubbed with chalk to a dazzling white , worn by candidates ( from latin candida , '' pure white '' ) for public office toga candida is the etymological source of the word candidate toga pulla : a '' dark toga '' was supposed to be worn by mourning at elite funerals a toga praetexta was also acceptable as mourning wear , if turned inside out to conceal its stripe ; so was a plain toga pura . wearing a toga pulla at the feast that ended mourning was irreligious , ignorant , or plain bad manners cicero makes a distinction between the toga pulla and an ordinary toga deliberately '' dirtied '' by its wearer as a legitimate mark of protest or supplication . toga picta ( '' painted toga '' ) : dyed solid purple , decorated with imagery in gold thread , and worn over a similarly-decorated tunica palmata ; used by generals in their triumphs trabea , associated with citizens of equites ; thus their description as trabeati in some contemporary roman literature some later roman and post-roman sources describe it as solid purple or red , either identifying or confusing it with the dress worn by the ancient roman kings ( also used to clothe images of the gods ) or reflecting changes in the trabea itself more certainly , equites wore an angusticlavia , a tunic with narrow , vertical purple stripes , at least one of which would have been visible when worn with a toga or trabea , whatever its form the toga 's most distinguishing feature was its semi-circular shape , which sets it apart from other cloaks of antiquity like the greek himation or pallium the plebeian who made up the vast majority of the roman electorate had limited influence on politics , unless barracking or voting en masse , or through representation by their tribunes the equites ( sometimes loosely translated as '' knights '' ) occupied a broadly mobile , mid-position between the lower senatorial and upper commoner class the highest-status toga , the solidly purple , gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest-ranking magistrates tyrian purple was supposedly reserved for the toga picta , the border of the toga praetexta , and elements of the priestly dress worn by the inviolate vestal virgins once a boy came of age ( usually at puberty ) he adopted the plain white toga virilis ; this meant that he was free to set up his own household , marry , and vote young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage , and adopted the stola senatorial versions were expensively laundered to an exceptional , snowy white ; those of lower ranking citizens were a duller shade , more cheaply laundered respectable women , the sons of freeborn men , and provincials during the early empire could hold lesser forms of citizenship ; they were protected by law but could not vote , or stand for public office . in roman territories , the toga was explicitly forbidden to non-citizens ; to foreigners , freedmen , and slaves ; to roman exiles ; exiles were deprived of citizenship and the protection of roman law formal seating arrangements in public theatres and circuses reflected the dominance of rome 's togate elect in livy 's history of rome , the patrician hero lucius quinctius cincinnatus , retired from public life and clad ( presumably ) in tunic or loincloth , is ploughing his field when emissaries of the senate arrive , and ask him to put on his toga . rome 's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all rome 's great men wore togas , and must always have done so but the poorest probably had to make do with a shabby , patched-up toga , if he bothered at all ; throughout the empire , there is evidence that old clothing was recycled , repaired and handed down the social scale , from one owner to the next , until it fell to rags centonarii ( '' patch workers '' ) made a living by sewing clothing and other items from recycled fabric patches the cost of a new , simple hooded cloak , using far less material than a toga , might represent three fifths of an individual 's annual minimum subsistence cost : see the poet horace writes '' of a rich ex-slave 'parading from end to end of the via sacra in a toga three yards long ' to show off his new status and wealth . rank , reputation and romanitas were paramount , even in death , so almost invariably , a male citizen 's memorial image showed him clad in his toga . despite the overwhelming quantity of roman togate portraits at every social level , and in every imaginable circumstance , at most times rome 's thoroughfares would have been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens in a variety of colourful garments , with few togas in evidence only a higher-class roman , a magistrate , would have had lictors to clear his way , and even then , wearing a toga was a challenge . martial and his friend juvenal suffered the system as clients for years , and found the whole business demeaning along with their toga , striped tunic and formal shoes ( or calcei ) , this signified their status the unmarried daughters of respectable , reasonably well-off citizens sometimes wore the toga praetexta until puberty or marriage , when they adopted the stola , which they wore over a full-length , usually long-sleeved tunic the romans believed that in rome 's earliest days , its military had gone to war in togas , hitching them up and back for action by using what became known as the '' gabine cinch '' citizens attending rome 's frequent roman festivals and associated ludi were expected to wear the toga . the umbo ( literally '' knob '' ) was a pouch of the toga 's fabric pulled out over the balteus ( the diagonal section of the toga across the chest ) in imperial-era forms of the toga the toga nevertheless remained the formal costume of the roman senatorial elite

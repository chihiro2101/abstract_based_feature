left catholic priest nicholas steno established the theoretical basis for stratigraphy when he introduced the law of superposition , the principle of original horizontality and the principle of lateral continuity in a 1669 work on the fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , who studied the geology of the region around paris image : geology of cyprus-chalk.jpg thumb chalk layers in cyprus , showing sedimentary layering variation in rock units , most obviously displayed as visible layering , is due to physical contrasts in rock type ( lithology ) these variations provide a lithostratigraphy or lithologic stratigraphy of the rock unit key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rocks , seals , and traps of petroleum geology chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age , rather than a relative age on rock strata if the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today 's field ( north magnetic pole near the north pole ) , the strata would retain a normal polarity ics subcommission for stratigraphic information university of south carolina sequence stratigraphy web front range stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy university of georgia ( usa ) stratigraphy lab stratigraphy.net a stratigraphic data provider

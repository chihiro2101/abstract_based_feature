left catholic priest nicholas steno established the theoretical basis for stratigraphy when he introduced the law of superposition , the principle of original horizontality and the principle of lateral continuity in a 1669 work on the fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment the first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by william smith in the 1790s and early 19th century known as the '' father of english geology '' , smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata ; he created the first geologic map of england image : geology of cyprus-chalk.jpg thumb chalk layers in cyprus , showing sedimentary layering variation in rock units , most obviously displayed as visible layering , is due to physical contrasts in rock type ( lithology ) key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment the basic concept in stratigraphy , called the law of superposition , states : in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence , the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence cyclostratigraphy documents the often cyclic changes in the relative proportions of minerals ( particularly carbonates ) , grain size , thickness of sediment layers ( varves ) and fossil diversity with time , related to seasonal or longer term changes in palaeoclimates biostratigraphy or paleontology stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers for sedimentary rocks this is possible because , as they fall through the water column , very fine-grained magnetic minerals ( < & nbsp ; 17 & nbsp ; Î¼m ) behave like tiny compasses , orienting themselves with earth 's magnetic field if the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today 's field ( north magnetic pole near the north pole ) , the strata would retain a normal polarity assise bed ( geology ) conodont biostratigraphy erygmascope ( old instrument for studying strata ) harris matrix important publications in stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy key bed sedimentary basin analysis sequence stratigraphy sadler effect tectonostratigraphy ics subcommission for stratigraphic information university of south carolina sequence stratigraphy web front range stratigraphy international commission on stratigraphy university of georgia ( usa ) stratigraphy lab stratigraphy.net a stratigraphic data provider

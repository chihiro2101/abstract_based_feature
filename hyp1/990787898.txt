in the late 1960s , hewlett-packard this part of hp was later ( c they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments ) the bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time , using a simple parallel bus and several individual control lines it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions , as well as device-independent commands , data structures , error protocols , and the like ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 built on ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without superseding it ; equipment can conform to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without following ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands in 1989 , hp developed their tml language which was the forerunner to standard commands for programmable instrumentation ( scpi ) , introduced as an industry standard in 1990 scpi mandated the ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 syntax , but allowed other ( non-ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ) physical transports the iec developed their own standards in parallel with the ieee , with iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 and iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 ( iec & nbsp ; 625 ) , later replaced by iec & nbsp ; 60488 the standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to total cable length hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation commodore 's following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on ieee & nbsp ; 488 very few mass-market personal computers or peripherals ( such as printers or scanners ) implemented ieee & nbsp ; 488

in the late 1960s , hewlett-packard this part of hp was later ( c they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments ) the bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time , using a simple parallel bus and several individual control lines hp licensed the hp-ib patents for a nominal fee to other manufacturers it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) these standards formalized the mechanical , electrical , and basic protocol parameters of gpib , but said nothing about the format of commands or data in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 built on ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without superseding it ; equipment can conform to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without following ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands the iec developed their own standards in parallel with the ieee , with iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 and iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 ( iec & nbsp ; 625 ) , later replaced by iec & nbsp ; 60488 national instruments introduced a backward-compatible extension to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 , originally known as hs-488 this was incorporated into the standard in 2003 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-2003 ) , over hp 's objections one unusual feature of ieee & nbsp ; 488 connectors is they commonly use a '' double-headed '' design , with male on one side , and female on the other commodore 's following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on ieee & nbsp ; 488 electrically , ieee & nbsp ; 488 used a hardware interface that could be implemented with some discrete logic or with a microcontroller

in the late 1960s , hewlett-packard this part of hp was later ( c they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments ) it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions , as well as device-independent commands , data structures , error protocols , and the like ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 built on ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without superseding it ; equipment can conform to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without following ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands scpi added standard generic commands , and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands the iec developed their own standards in parallel with the ieee , with iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 and iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 ( iec & nbsp ; 625 ) , later replaced by iec & nbsp ; 60488 it increased the maximum data rate to 8 mbyte/s , although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus the standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to total cable length hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation the commodore pet ( introduced 1977 ) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the ieee & nbsp ; 488 bus , but with a non-standard card edge connector commodore 's following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on ieee & nbsp ; 488 eventually , faster , more complete standards such as scsi superseded ieee & nbsp ; 488 for peripheral access

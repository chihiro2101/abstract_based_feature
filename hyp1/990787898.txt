in the late 1960s , hewlett-packard this part of hp was later ( c manufactured various automated test and measurement instruments , such as digital multimeters and logic analyzers they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments ) the bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time , using a simple parallel bus and several individual control lines it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control as gpib became popular , it was formalized by various standards organizations in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) these standards formalized the mechanical , electrical , and basic protocol parameters of gpib , but said nothing about the format of commands or data in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 built on ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without superseding it ; equipment can conform to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without following ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands the iec developed their own standards in parallel with the ieee , with iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 and iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 ( iec & nbsp ; 625 ) , later replaced by iec & nbsp ; 60488 it increased the maximum data rate to 8 mbyte/s , although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus the bus supports 31 five-bit primary device addresses numbered from 0 to 30 , allocating a unique address to each device on the bus . use as a computer interface hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation

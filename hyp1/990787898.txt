in the late 1960s , hewlett-packard this part of hp was later ( c they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments ) the bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time , using a simple parallel bus and several individual control lines it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 built on ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without superseding it ; equipment can conform to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without following ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands scpi mandated the ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 syntax , but allowed other ( non-ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ) physical transports it increased the maximum data rate to 8 mbyte/s , although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus this was incorporated into the standard in 2003 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-2003 ) , over hp 's objections control and data transfer functions are logically separated ; a controller can address one device as a '' talker '' and one or more devices as '' listeners '' without having to participate in the data transfer one unusual feature of ieee & nbsp ; 488 connectors is they commonly use a '' double-headed '' design , with male on one side , and female on the other hp 's designers did not specifically plan for ieee & nbsp ; 488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers ; the focus was on instrumentation some of hp 's advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s , such as the hp-41 and hp-71b series , also had ieee & nbsp ; 488 capabilities , via an optional hp-il/hp-ib interface module electrically , ieee & nbsp ; 488 used a hardware interface that could be implemented with some discrete logic or with a microcontroller

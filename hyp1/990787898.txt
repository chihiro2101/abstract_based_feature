they developed the hp interface bus ( hp-ib ) to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers ( computers and other instruments ) it became known as the general purpose interface bus ( gpib ) , and became a de facto standard for automated and industrial instrument control in 1975 , the ieee standardized the bus as standard digital interface for programmable instrumentation , ieee & nbsp ; 488 ; it was revised in 1978 ( producing ieee & nbsp ; 488-1978 ) & nbsp ; iii the standard was revised in 1987 , and redesignated as ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-1987 ) these standards formalized the mechanical , electrical , and basic protocol parameters of gpib , but said nothing about the format of commands or data in 1987 , ieee introduced standard codes , formats , protocols , and common commands , ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 built on ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without superseding it ; equipment can conform to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 without following ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 while ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 defined the hardware and ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 defined the protocol , there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands scpi added standard generic commands , and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands scpi mandated the ieee & nbsp ; 488.2 syntax , but allowed other ( non-ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 ) physical transports the iec developed their own standards in parallel with the ieee , with iec & nbsp ; 60625-1 and iec & nbsp ; 60625-2 ( iec & nbsp ; 625 ) , later replaced by iec & nbsp ; 60488 national instruments introduced a backward-compatible extension to ieee & nbsp ; 488.1 , originally known as hs-488 this was incorporated into the standard in 2003 ( ieee & nbsp ; 488.1-2003 ) , over hp 's objections some of hp 's advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s , such as the hp-41 and hp-71b series , also had ieee & nbsp ; 488 capabilities , via an optional hp-il/hp-ib interface module the commodore pet ( introduced 1977 ) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the ieee & nbsp ; 488 bus , but with a non-standard card edge connector physically , the ieee & nbsp ; 488 connectors and cabling were rugged and held in place by screws very few mass-market personal computers or peripherals ( such as printers or scanners ) implemented ieee & nbsp ; 488

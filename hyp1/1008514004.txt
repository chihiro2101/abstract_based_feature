macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose in some cases , pathogens are very resistant to adhesion by the macrophages the processed antigen is then presented in mhcii on the surface of the b-cell m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m2 is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages , and can be further elevated by il-4 unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 they also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound this dysregulation results in insufficient m2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair both m1 and m2 macrophages play a role in promotion of atherosclerosis the first subpopulation has no direct benefit to repairing muscle , while the second non-phagocytic group does it is known that macrophages ' involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific ; they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury macrophages are essential for wound healing they replace polymorphonuclear neutrophils as the predominant cells in the wound by day two after injury numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs once they are in the wound site , monocytes mature into macrophages the macrophage 's main role is to phagocytize bacteria and damaged tissue , and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases by secreting these factors , macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase once engulfed by a macrophage , the causative agent of tuberculosis , mycobacterium tuberculosis , avoids cellular defenses and uses the cell to replicate like t cells , macrophages can be infected with hiv , and even become a reservoir of ongoing virus replication throughout the body macrophages can contribute to tumor growth and progression by promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion , fostering tumor angiogenesis and suppressing antitumor immune cells macrophages and intestinal macrophages have high plasticity causing their phenotype to be altered by their environments there is no drop off in phagocytosis efficiency as intestinal macrophages are able to effectively phagocytize the bacteria , s there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages the j774 cells were treated with 5 & nbsp ; ng/ml interferon-Î³ one night before filming with conidia file : s3-alveolar macrophages with conidia in liquid medium.ogv two highly active alveolar macrophages can be seen ingesting conidia

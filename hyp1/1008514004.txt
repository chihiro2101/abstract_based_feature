macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils when a macrophage ingests a pathogen , the pathogen becomes trapped in a phagosome , which then fuses with a lysosome typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response after digesting a pathogen , a macrophage will present the antigen ( a molecule , most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification ) of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m1 macrophages have pro-inflammatory , bactericidal , and phagocytic functions tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the m2 phenotype , and seem to actively promote tumor growth unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound m2 macrophages are needed for vascular stability they produce vascular epithelial growth factor-a and tgf-Î²1 there is a phenotype shift from m1 to m2 macrophages in acute wounds , however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner however , dysregulation occurs as the m1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation both m1 and m2 macrophages play a role in promotion of atherosclerosis m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading the second group is the non-phagocytic types that are distributed near regenerative fibers these peak between two and four days and remain elevated for several days during the hopeful muscle rebuilding it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs these factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area legionella pneumophila , the causative agent of legionnaires ' disease , also establishes residence within macrophages research in various study models suggests that macrophages can sometimes acquire anti-tumor functions like macrophages , intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes , though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiota in the intestines this change is directly caused by the intestinal macrophages environment the presence of inflammation or pathogen alters this homeostasis , and concurrently alters the intestinal macrophages file : s3-alveolar macrophages with conidia in liquid medium.ogv two highly active alveolar macrophages can be seen ingesting conidia

macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a waste material is expelled or assimilated ( the latter not pictured ) parts : 1 macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule ( mhcii ) , indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen , despite having antigens on its surface eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites in spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages , there are two main groups designated m1 and m2 m1 macrophages have pro-inflammatory , bactericidal , and phagocytic functions m2 is the phenotype of resident tissue macrophages , and can be further elevated by il-4 m2 macrophages produce high levels of il-10 , tgf-beta and low levels of il-12 macrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation m1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators : interferon-γ ( ifn-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , and damage associated molecular patterns ( damps ) unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 they also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization m2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles : m2a , m2b , m2c , and m2d how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis the initial wave is a phagocytic population that comes along during periods of increased muscle use that are sufficient to cause muscle membrane lysis and membrane inflammation , which can enter and degrade the contents of injured muscle fibers attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells , monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls the spleen contains half the body 's monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines , especially during the third and fourth post-wound days macrophages may also restrain the contraction phase they found that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of limb regeneration and a scarring response tumor-associated macrophages ( tams ) are thought to acquire an m2 phenotype , contributing to tumor growth and progression however , macrophages are also involved in antibody mediated cytotoxicity ( adcc ) and this mechanism has been proposed to be important for certain cancer immunotherapy antibodies there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages file : s3-alveolar macrophages with conidia in liquid medium.ogv two highly active alveolar macrophages can be seen ingesting conidia

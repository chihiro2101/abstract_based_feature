macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles as scavengers , they rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 the presentation is done by integrating it into the cell membrane and displaying it attached to an mhc class ii molecule ( mhcii ) , indicating to other white blood cells that the macrophage is not a pathogen , despite having antigens on its surface eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) when a b-cell in the lymph node recognizes the same unprocessed surface antigen on the bacterium with its surface bound antibody , the antigen is endocytosed and processed macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites there are several activated forms of macrophages in spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages , there are two main groups designated m1 and m2 m1 macrophages have pro-inflammatory , bactericidal , and phagocytic functions tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the m2 phenotype , and seem to actively promote tumor growth macrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation these mediator molecules create a pro-inflammatory response that in return produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 and tnf unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound there is a phenotype shift from m1 to m2 macrophages in acute wounds , however this shift is impaired for chronic wounds this dysregulation results in insufficient m2 macrophages and its corresponding growth factors that aid in wound repair at this point , inflammation is not needed and m1 undergoes a switch to m2 ( anti-inflammatory ) however , dysregulation occurs as the m1 macrophages are unable/do not phagocytose neutrophils that have undergone apoptosis leading to increased macrophage migration and inflammation m1 & nbsp ; macrophages promote atherosclerosis by inflammation m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair , growth , and regeneration is that there are two '' waves '' of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use & nbsp ; – subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle the first subpopulation has no direct benefit to repairing muscle , while the second non-phagocytic group does it is known that macrophages ' involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific ; they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury this occurs repeatedly as the pigment from dead dermal macrophages is phagocytosed by their successors , preserving the tattoo in the same place due to their role in phagocytosis , macrophages are involved in many diseases of the immune system legionella pneumophila , the causative agent of legionnaires ' disease , also establishes residence within macrophages like macrophages , intestinal macrophages are differentiated monocytes , though intestinal macrophages have to coexist with the microbiota in the intestines whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 and tnf-α , intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages

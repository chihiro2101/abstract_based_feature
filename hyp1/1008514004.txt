macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site unlike short-lived neutrophils , macrophages survive longer in the body , up to several months file : phagocytosis zp.svg thumb right 400px steps of a macrophage ingesting a pathogen : a macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils however , some bacteria , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis , have become resistant to these methods of digestion typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) t cells that express the t cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-mhcii complex ( with co-stimulatory factors- cd40 and cd40l ) cause the b-cell to produce antibodies that help opsonisation of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by phagocytes macrophages provide yet another line of defense against tumor cells and somatic cells infected with fungus or parasites there are several activated forms of macrophages in spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages , there are two main groups designated m1 and m2 m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m2 macrophages produce high levels of il-10 , tgf-beta and low levels of il-12 tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the m2 phenotype , and seem to actively promote tumor growth macrophages exist in a variety of phenotypes which are determined by the role they play in wound maturation m1 macrophages are the dominating phenotype observed in the early stages of inflammation and are activated by four key mediators : interferon-γ ( ifn-γ ) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) , and damage associated molecular patterns ( damps ) unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 they also play a role in wound healing and are needed for revascularization and reepithelialization m2 macrophages are divided into four major types based on their roles : m2a , m2b , m2c , and m2d how m2 phenotypes are determined is still up for discussion but studies have shown that their environment allows them to adjust to whichever phenotype is most appropriate to efficiently heal the wound with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading the second group is the non-phagocytic types that are distributed near regenerative fibers it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown it is known that macrophages ' involvement in promoting tissue repair is not muscle specific ; they accumulate in numerous tissues during the healing process phase following injury the spleen contains half the body 's monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue these resident macrophages are sessile ( non-migratory ) , provide essential growth factors to support the physiological function of the tissue ( e.g it has been observed that increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages within obese adipose tissue contributes to obesity complications including insulin resistance and diabetes type 2 whereas tissue macrophages release various inflammatory cytokines , such as il-1 , il-6 and tnf-α , intestinal macrophages do not produce or secrete inflammatory cytokines in a healthy gut , intestinal macrophages limit the inflammatory response in the gut , but in a disease-state , intestinal macrophage numbers and diversity are altered there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages

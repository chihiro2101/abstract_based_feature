macrophages that reside in adult healthy tissues either derive from circulating monocytes or are established before birth and then maintained during adult life independently of monocytes by contrast , most of the macrophages that accumulate at diseased sites typically derive from circulating monocytes when a monocyte enters damaged tissue through the endothelium of a blood vessel , a process known as leukocyte extravasation , it undergoes a series of changes to become a macrophage monocytes are attracted to a damaged site by chemical substances through chemotaxis , triggered by a range of stimuli including damaged cells , pathogens and cytokines released by macrophages already at the site at some sites such as the testis , macrophages have been shown to populate the organ through proliferation macrophages are professional phagocytes and are highly specialized in removal of dying or dead cells and cellular debris this role is important in chronic inflammation , as the early stages of inflammation are dominated by neutrophils , which are ingested by macrophages if they come of age ( see cd31 for a description of this process ) the neutrophils are at first attracted to a site , where they perform their function and die , before they are phagocytized by the macrophages when at the site , the first wave of neutrophils , after the process of aging and after the first 48 hours , stimulate the appearance of the macrophages whereby these macrophages will then ingest the aged neutrophils typhoidal salmonellae induce their own phagocytosis by host macrophages in vivo , and inhibit digestion by lysosomal action , thereby using macrophages for their own replication and causing macrophage apoptosis macrophages can digest more than 100 bacteria before they finally die due to their own digestive compounds macrophages are versatile cells that play many roles along with dendritic cells , they are foremost among the cells that present antigens , a crucial role in initiating an immune response as secretory cells , monocytes and macrophages are vital to the regulation of immune responses and the development of inflammation ; they produce a wide array of powerful chemical substances ( monokines ) including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin-1 at the same time , they carry receptors for lymphokines that allow them to be '' activated '' into single-minded pursuit of microbes and tumour cells after digesting a pathogen , a macrophage will present the antigen ( a molecule , most often a protein found on the surface of the pathogen and used by the immune system for identification ) of the pathogen to the corresponding helper t cell eventually , the antigen presentation results in the production of antibody that attach to the antigens of pathogens , making them easier for macrophages to adhere to with their cell membrane and phagocytose the antigen presentation on the surface of infected macrophages ( in the context of mhc class ii ) in a lymph node stimulates th1 ( type 1 helper t cells ) to proliferate ( mainly due to il-12 secretion from the macrophage ) t cells that express the t cell receptor which recognizes the antigen-mhcii complex ( with co-stimulatory factors- cd40 and cd40l ) cause the b-cell to produce antibodies that help opsonisation of the antigen so that the bacteria can be better cleared by phagocytes once a t cell has recognized its particular antigen on the surface of an aberrant cell , the t cell becomes an activated effector cell , producing chemical mediators known as lymphokines that stimulate macrophages into a more aggressive form in spite of a spectrum of ways to activate macrophages , there are two main groups designated m1 and m2 m1 macrophages : as mentioned earlier ( previously referred to as classically activated macrophages ) , m1 '' killer '' macrophages are activated by lps and ifn-gamma , and secrete high levels of il-12 and low levels of il-10 m2 macrophages produce high levels of il-10 , tgf-beta and low levels of il-12 tumor-associated macrophages are mainly of the m2 phenotype , and seem to actively promote tumor growth unlike m1 macrophages , m2 macrophages secrete an anti-inflammatory response via the addition of interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 with a lack of these growth factors/anti-inflammatory cytokines and an overabundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines from m1 macrophages chronic wounds are unable to heal in a timely manner m2 & nbsp ; macrophages can remove cholesterol from blood vessels , but when the cholesterol is oxidized , the m2 & nbsp ; macrophages become apoptosis foam cells contributing to the atheroma of atherosclerosis the first step to understanding the importance of macrophages in muscle repair , growth , and regeneration is that there are two '' waves '' of macrophages with the onset of damageable muscle use & nbsp ; â€“ subpopulations that do and do not directly have an influence on repairing muscle these early-invading , phagocytic macrophages reach their highest concentration about 24 hours following the onset of some form of muscle cell injury or reloading it is thought that macrophages release soluble substances that influence the proliferation , differentiation , growth , repair , and regeneration of muscle , but at this time the factor that is produced to mediate these effects is unknown they replace polymorphonuclear neutrophils as the predominant cells in the wound by day two after injury macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines , especially during the third and fourth post-wound days macrophages are the predominant cells involved in creating the progressive plaque lesions of atherosclerosis like t cells , macrophages can be infected with hiv , and even become a reservoir of ongoing virus replication throughout the body for example , macrophages may have cytotoxic activity to kill tumor cells directly ; also the co-operation of t-cells and macrophages is important to suppress tumors it has been observed that increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages within obese adipose tissue contributes to obesity complications including insulin resistance and diabetes type 2 within the fat ( adipose ) tissue of ccr2 deficient mice , there is an increased number of eosinophils , greater alternative macrophage activation , and a propensity towards type 2 cytokine expression there has yet to be a determined mechanism for the alteration of the intestinal macrophages by recruitment of new monocytes or changes in the already present intestinal macrophages file : s3-alveolar macrophages with conidia in liquid medium.ogv two highly active alveolar macrophages can be seen ingesting conidia

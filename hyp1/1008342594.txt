a higher temperature of recorded at signy research station on 30 january 1982 was the record for the antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60° s along the antarctic peninsula , temperatures as high as have been recorded , though the summer temperature is below most of the time east antarctica is colder than west antarctica because of its higher elevation the antarctic peninsula has the most moderate climate the total precipitation on antarctica , averaged over the entire continent , is about per year ( vaughan et al antarctica contains 90 % of the world 's ice and more than 70 % of its fresh water the antarctic is so cold that even with increases of a few degrees , temperatures would generally remain below the melting point of ice this would increase the amount of ice in antarctica , offsetting approximately one third of the expected sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans because ice flows , albeit slowly , the ice within the ice sheet is younger than the age of the sheet itself the majority of ice shelf consists of floating ice , and a lesser amount consists of glaciers that move slowly from the land mass into the sea if ice shelves break up , the ice flow behind them may accelerate , resulting in increasing melt of the antarctic ice sheet and an increasing contribution to sea level known changes in coastline ice around the antarctic peninsula : 1936–1989 : wordie ice shelf significantly reduced in size 1995 : the larsen a ice shelf disintegrated in january 1995 the spot , which is located in the heart of the west antarctic ice sheet , is one of the fastest-warming places on earth temperature data from the reader project a pamphlet about the weather and climate of antarctica antarctica 's central ice cap grows while glaciers melt antarctica climate and weather

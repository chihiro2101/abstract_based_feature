the highest temperature ever recorded on antarctica was at comandante ferraz antarctic station on 9 february 2020 , beating the previous record of at esperanza base , on the northern tip of the antarctic peninsula , on 6 february 2020 a higher temperature of recorded at signy research station on 30 january 1982 was the record for the antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60° s it was discovered during a national snow and ice data center review of stored data in december 2013 but revised by researchers on 25 june 2018 the coast is warmer ; on the coast antarctic average temperatures are around ( in the warmest parts of antarctica ) and in the elevated inland they average about in vostok the total precipitation on antarctica , averaged over the entire continent , is about per year ( vaughan et al almost all antarctic precipitation falls as snow the weather in antarctica can be highly variable , and the weather conditions can often change dramatically in short periods of time antarctica contains 90 % of the world 's ice and more than 70 % of its fresh water the antarctic is so cold that even with increases of a few degrees , temperatures would generally remain below the melting point of ice this would increase the amount of ice in antarctica , offsetting approximately one third of the expected sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans during a recent decade , east antarctica thickened at an average rate of about per year while west antarctica showed an overall thinning of per year melting or breakup of floating shelf ice does not directly affect global sea levels ; however , ice shelves have a buttressing effect on the ice flow behind them known changes in coastline ice around the antarctic peninsula : 1936–1989 : wordie ice shelf significantly reduced in size ipcc 2007 , intergovernmental panel on climate change , climate change 2007 : the physical science basis temperature data from the reader project a pamphlet about the weather and climate of antarctica antarctica 's central ice cap grows while glaciers melt antarctica climate and weather

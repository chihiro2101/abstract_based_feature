the highest temperature ever recorded on antarctica was at comandante ferraz antarctic station on 9 february 2020 , beating the previous record of at esperanza base , on the northern tip of the antarctic peninsula , on 6 february 2020 a higher temperature of recorded at signy research station on 30 january 1982 was the record for the antarctic region encompassing all land and ice south of 60Â° s satellite measurements have identified even lower ground temperatures , with having been observed at the cloud-free antarctic plateau on 10 august 2010 it was discovered during a national snow and ice data center review of stored data in december 2013 but revised by researchers on 25 june 2018 the coast is warmer ; on the coast antarctic average temperatures are around ( in the warmest parts of antarctica ) and in the elevated inland they average about in vostok the antarctic peninsula has the most moderate climate nearly all of antarctica is covered by a sheet of ice that is , on average , a mile thick or more ( 1.6 & nbsp ; km ) this would increase the amount of ice in antarctica , offsetting approximately one third of the expected sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans during a recent decade , east antarctica thickened at an average rate of about per year while west antarctica showed an overall thinning of per year ice shelves lose mass through breakup of glacial ice ( calving ) , or basal melting due to warm ocean water under the ice melting or breakup of floating shelf ice does not directly affect global sea levels ; however , ice shelves have a buttressing effect on the ice flow behind them if ice shelves break up , the ice flow behind them may accelerate , resulting in increasing melt of the antarctic ice sheet and an increasing contribution to sea level in their latest study ( 20 september 2007 ) nasa researchers have confirmed that antarctic snow is melting farther inland from the coast over time , melting at higher altitudes than ever and increasingly melting on antarctica 's largest ice shelf temperature data from the reader project a pamphlet about the weather and climate of antarctica antarctica 's central ice cap grows while glaciers melt antarctica climate and weather western antarctica warming confirmed 23 december 2012 usa today nasa experts explain ice melt in antarctica ( 2014 )

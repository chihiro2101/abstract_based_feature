the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy andromeda is known as '' the chained lady '' or '' the chained woman '' in english three of the neighboring constellations ( perseus , cassiopeia and cepheus ) represent characters in the perseus myth , while cetus retreats to beyond pisces andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars she is typically depicted with α andromedae as her head , ο and λ andromedae as her chains , and δ , π , μ , β , and γ her body and legs however , there is no universal depiction of andromeda and the stars used to represent her body , head , and chains arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet several stars from andromeda and most of the stars in lacerta were combined in 1787 by german astronomer johann bode to form frederici honores ( also called friedrichs ehre ) gamma andromedae and its neighbors were called '' teen ta tseang keun '' ( 天大将军 , heaven 's great general ) , representing honor in astrology and a great general in mythology an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation devyani is the daughter of guru shukracharya while shar sharmishtha andromeda galaxy hindi wikipedia hindu legends surrounding andromeda are similar to the greek myths ancient sanskrit texts depict antarmada chained to a rock , as in the greek myth scholars believe that the hindu and greek astrological myths were closely linked ; one piece of evidence cited is the similarity between the names '' antarmada '' and '' andromeda '' andromeda is also associated with the mesopotamian creation story of tiamat , the goddess of chaos he used her body to create the constellations as markers of time for humans in the marshall islands , andromeda , cassiopeia , triangulum , and aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a porpoise α and ( alpheratz , sirrah ) is the brightest star in this constellation almach is a multiple star with a yellow primary of magnitude 2.3 and a blue-green secondary of magnitude 5.0 , separated by 9.7 arcseconds δ and is an orange-hued giant star of type k3 orange giant of magnitude 3.3 υ and ( titawin ) is a magnitude 4.1 binary system that consists of one f-type dwarf and an m-type dwarf ξ and ( adhil ) is a binary star 217 light-years away π and is a blue-white hued binary star of magnitude 4.3 that is 598 light-years away it is 177 light-years from earth and is an orange-hued giant star of type k3 it is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0 the other open cluster in andromeda is ngc 7686 , which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the milky way there is one prominent planetary nebula in andromeda : ngc 7662 ( caldwell 22 ) andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself is considered to be diffuse , as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from andromeda itself

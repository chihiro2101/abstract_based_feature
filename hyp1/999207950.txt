the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens andromeda 's panicked father , cepheus , was told by the oracle of ammon that the only way to save his kingdom was to sacrifice his daughter to cetus andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars however , there is no universal depiction of andromeda and the stars used to represent her body , head , and chains arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet like all those that date back to a pattern known to ptolemy , it is attributed to a wider zone and thus many surrounding stars an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces ν and , μ and , β and , η and , ζ and , ε and , δ and , π and , and 32 and were all included from andromeda ; ν psc , φ psc , χ psc , and ψ psc were included from pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation devyani and sharmishta are wives of king yayati ( perseus constellation ) who is the earliest patriarch of the kuru and yadu clans that are mentioned frequently in epic mahabharat in the marshall islands , andromeda , cassiopeia , triangulum , and aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a porpoise andromeda 's bright stars are mostly in the body of the porpoise ; cassiopeia represents its tail and aries its head in the tuamotu islands , alpha andromedae was called takurua-e-te-tuki-hanga-ruki , meaning '' star of the wearisome toil '' , and beta andromedae was called piringa-o-tautu α and ( alpheratz , sirrah ) is the brightest star in this constellation it is an a0p class binary star with an overall apparent visual magnitude of 2.1 and a luminosity of the arabic names are a reference to the fact that α and forms an asterism known as the '' great square of pegasus '' with three stars in pegasus : α , β , and γ peg however , β and was mostly considered by the arabs to be a part of al-hut , a constellation representing a larger fish than pisces at andromeda 's feet γ and ( almach ) is an orange-hued bright giant star of type k3 found at the southern tip of the constellation with an overall magnitude of 2.14 π and is a blue-white hued binary star of magnitude 4.3 that is 598 light-years away it is 177 light-years from earth and is an orange-hued giant star of type k3 the primary is a yellow-hued giant star of type k0 with an apparent magnitude of 5.7 that is 316 light-years away the secondary is an orange-hued giant star of type k0 and magnitude 5.9 that is 990 light-years from earth its maximum magnitude is 5.8 and its minimum magnitude is 14.8 , and it is at a distance of 1,250 light-years hubble originally estimated that the andromeda galaxy was 900,000 light-years away , but ernst öpik 's estimate in 1925 put the distance closer to 1.5 million light-years m32 was discovered in 1749 by french astronomer guillaume le gentil and has since been found to lie closer to earth than the andromeda galaxy itself these satellite galaxies , like the satellites of the milky way , tend to be older , gas-poor dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxy this galaxy is at an approximate distance of 30 million light-years from earth , calculated from its redshift of 0.002

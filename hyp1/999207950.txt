the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens it has also been called persea ( '' perseus 's wife '' ) or cepheis ( '' cepheus 's daughter '' ) , all names that refer to andromeda 's role in the greco-roman myth of perseus , in which cassiopeia , the queen of ethiopia , bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the nereids , sea nymphs blessed with incredible beauty andromeda 's panicked father , cepheus , was told by the oracle of ammon that the only way to save his kingdom was to sacrifice his daughter to cetus perseus and andromeda then married ; the myth recounts that the couple had nine children together & nbsp ; – seven sons and two daughters & nbsp ; – and founded mycenae and its persideae dynasty after andromeda 's death athena placed her in the sky as a constellation , to honor her three of the neighboring constellations ( perseus , cassiopeia and cepheus ) represent characters in the perseus myth , while cetus retreats to beyond pisces andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars she is typically depicted with α andromedae as her head , ο and λ andromedae as her chains , and δ , π , μ , β , and γ her body and legs arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet several stars from andromeda and most of the stars in lacerta were combined in 1787 by german astronomer johann bode to form frederici honores ( also called friedrichs ehre ) since the time of ptolemy , andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the international astronomical union in traditional chinese astronomy , nine stars from andromeda ( including beta andromedae , mu andromedae , and nu andromedae ) , along with seven stars from pisces , formed an elliptical constellation called '' legs '' ( 奎宿 ) for the chinese , the northern swath of andromeda formed a stable for changing horses , 天厩 , stable on sky ) and the far western part , along with most of lacerta , became tengshe , a flying snake an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation devyani is the daughter of guru shukracharya while shar sharmishtha andromeda galaxy hindi wikipedia hindu legends surrounding andromeda are similar to the greek myths ancient sanskrit texts depict antarmada chained to a rock , as in the greek myth in the marshall islands , andromeda , cassiopeia , triangulum , and aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a porpoise in the tuamotu islands , alpha andromedae was called takurua-e-te-tuki-hanga-ruki , meaning '' star of the wearisome toil '' , and beta andromedae was called piringa-o-tautu as such , the star was formerly considered to belong to both andromeda and pegasus , and was co-designated as '' delta pegasi ( δ peg ) '' , although this name is no longer formally used however , β and was mostly considered by the arabs to be a part of al-hut , a constellation representing a larger fish than pisces at andromeda 's feet γ and ( almach ) is an orange-hued bright giant star of type k3 found at the southern tip of the constellation with an overall magnitude of 2.14 the most famous deep-sky object in andromeda is the spiral galaxy cataloged as messier 31 ( m31 ) or ngc 224 but known colloquially as the andromeda galaxy for the constellation m31 is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye , 2.2 & nbsp ; million light-years from earth ( estimates range up to 2.5 million light-years ) the andromeda galaxy 's two main companions , m32 and m110 ( also known as ngc 221 and ngc 205 , respectively ) are faint elliptical galaxies that lie near it along with the andromeda galaxy and its companions , the constellation also features ngc 891 ( caldwell 23 ) , a smaller galaxy just east of almach there is one prominent planetary nebula in andromeda : ngc 7662 ( caldwell 22 )

the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens it has also been called persea ( '' perseus 's wife '' ) or cepheis ( '' cepheus 's daughter '' ) , all names that refer to andromeda 's role in the greco-roman myth of perseus , in which cassiopeia , the queen of ethiopia , bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the nereids , sea nymphs blessed with incredible beauty after andromeda 's death athena placed her in the sky as a constellation , to honor her three of the neighboring constellations ( perseus , cassiopeia and cepheus ) represent characters in the perseus myth , while cetus retreats to beyond pisces andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet several stars from andromeda and most of the stars in lacerta were combined in 1787 by german astronomer johann bode to form frederici honores ( also called friedrichs ehre ) since the time of ptolemy , andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the international astronomical union in traditional chinese astronomy , nine stars from andromeda ( including beta andromedae , mu andromedae , and nu andromedae ) , along with seven stars from pisces , formed an elliptical constellation called '' legs '' ( 奎宿 ) gamma andromedae and its neighbors were called '' teen ta tseang keun '' ( 天大将军 , heaven 's great general ) , representing honor in astrology and a great general in mythology for the chinese , the northern swath of andromeda formed a stable for changing horses , 天厩 , stable on sky ) and the far western part , along with most of lacerta , became tengshe , a flying snake an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation devyani is the daughter of guru shukracharya while shar sharmishtha andromeda galaxy hindi wikipedia hindu legends surrounding andromeda are similar to the greek myths scholars believe that the hindu and greek astrological myths were closely linked ; one piece of evidence cited is the similarity between the names '' antarmada '' and '' andromeda '' andromeda 's bright stars are mostly in the body of the porpoise ; cassiopeia represents its tail and aries its head in the tuamotu islands , alpha andromedae was called takurua-e-te-tuki-hanga-ruki , meaning '' star of the wearisome toil '' , and beta andromedae was called piringa-o-tautu the arabic names are a reference to the fact that α and forms an asterism known as the '' great square of pegasus '' with three stars in pegasus : α , β , and γ peg it is 198 light-years away , has a magnitude of 2.06 , and a luminosity of γ and ( almach ) is an orange-hued bright giant star of type k3 found at the southern tip of the constellation with an overall magnitude of 2.14 π and is a blue-white hued binary star of magnitude 4.3 that is 598 light-years away the primary is a yellow-hued giant star of type k0 with an apparent magnitude of 5.7 that is 316 light-years away 14 and ( veritate ) is a yellow-hued giant star of type g8 that is 251 light-years away the most famous deep-sky object in andromeda is the spiral galaxy cataloged as messier 31 ( m31 ) or ngc 224 but known colloquially as the andromeda galaxy for the constellation it is an enormous & nbsp ; – 192.4 by 62.2 arcminutes in apparent size & nbsp ; – barred spiral galaxy similar in form to the milky way and at an approximate magnitude of 3.5 , is one of the brightest deep-sky objects in the northern sky the other open cluster in andromeda is ngc 7686 , which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the milky way andromedid meteors are known for being very slow and the shower itself is considered to be diffuse , as meteors can be seen coming from nearby constellations as well as from andromeda itself

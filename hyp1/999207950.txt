the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens perseus and andromeda then married ; the myth recounts that the couple had nine children together & nbsp ; – seven sons and two daughters & nbsp ; – and founded mycenae and its persideae dynasty after andromeda 's death athena placed her in the sky as a constellation , to honor her three of the neighboring constellations ( perseus , cassiopeia and cepheus ) represent characters in the perseus myth , while cetus retreats to beyond pisces andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars however , there is no universal depiction of andromeda and the stars used to represent her body , head , and chains arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet several stars from andromeda and most of the stars in lacerta were combined in 1787 by german astronomer johann bode to form frederici honores ( also called friedrichs ehre ) since the time of ptolemy , andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the international astronomical union gamma andromedae and its neighbors were called '' teen ta tseang keun '' ( 天大将军 , heaven 's great general ) , representing honor in astrology and a great general in mythology an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation devyani is the daughter of guru shukracharya while shar sharmishtha andromeda galaxy hindi wikipedia hindu legends surrounding andromeda are similar to the greek myths scholars believe that the hindu and greek astrological myths were closely linked ; one piece of evidence cited is the similarity between the names '' antarmada '' and '' andromeda '' in the marshall islands , andromeda , cassiopeia , triangulum , and aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a porpoise in the tuamotu islands , alpha andromedae was called takurua-e-te-tuki-hanga-ruki , meaning '' star of the wearisome toil '' , and beta andromedae was called piringa-o-tautu α and ( alpheratz , sirrah ) is the brightest star in this constellation it is an a0p class binary star with an overall apparent visual magnitude of 2.1 and a luminosity of however , β and was mostly considered by the arabs to be a part of al-hut , a constellation representing a larger fish than pisces at andromeda 's feet almach is a multiple star with a yellow primary of magnitude 2.3 and a blue-green secondary of magnitude 5.0 , separated by 9.7 arcseconds british astronomer william herschel said of the star : '' the striking difference in the colour of the two stars , suggests the idea of a sun and its planet , to which the contrast of their unequal size contributes not a little δ and is an orange-hued giant star of type k3 orange giant of magnitude 3.3 the secondary is an orange-hued giant star of type k0 and magnitude 5.9 that is 990 light-years from earth it is seen under a dark , transparent sky as a hazy patch in the north of the constellation hubble originally estimated that the andromeda galaxy was 900,000 light-years away , but ernst öpik 's estimate in 1925 put the distance closer to 1.5 million light-years andromeda 's most celebrated open cluster is ngc 752 ( caldwell 28 ) at an overall magnitude of 5.7 the other open cluster in andromeda is ngc 7686 , which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the milky way

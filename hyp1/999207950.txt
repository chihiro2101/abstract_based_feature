the uranography of andromeda has its roots most firmly in the greek tradition , though a female figure in andromeda 's location had appeared earlier in babylonian astronomy the stars that make up pisces and the middle portion of modern andromeda formed a constellation representing a fertility goddess , sometimes named as anunitum or the lady of the heavens andromeda is known as '' the chained lady '' or '' the chained woman '' in english it was known as mulier catenata ( '' chained woman '' ) in latin and al-mar'at al musalsalah in arabic andromeda 's panicked father , cepheus , was told by the oracle of ammon that the only way to save his kingdom was to sacrifice his daughter to cetus perseus and andromeda then married ; the myth recounts that the couple had nine children together & nbsp ; – seven sons and two daughters & nbsp ; – and founded mycenae and its persideae dynasty after andromeda 's death athena placed her in the sky as a constellation , to honor her andromeda was one of the original 48 constellations formulated by ptolemy in his 2nd-century almagest , in which it was defined as a specific pattern of stars however , there is no universal depiction of andromeda and the stars used to represent her body , head , and chains arab astronomers were aware of ptolemy 's constellations , but they included a second constellation representing a fish at andromeda 's feet several stars from andromeda and most of the stars in lacerta were combined in 1787 by german astronomer johann bode to form frederici honores ( also called friedrichs ehre ) since the time of ptolemy , andromeda has remained a constellation and is officially recognized by the international astronomical union in traditional chinese astronomy , nine stars from andromeda ( including beta andromedae , mu andromedae , and nu andromedae ) , along with seven stars from pisces , formed an elliptical constellation called '' legs '' ( 奎宿 ) an arab constellation called '' al-hut '' ( the fish ) was composed of several stars in andromeda , m31 , and several stars in pisces as per hindu astronomy , andromeda is known as devyani constellation while cassiopeia is sharmishta constellation devyani is the daughter of guru shukracharya while shar sharmishtha andromeda galaxy hindi wikipedia hindu legends surrounding andromeda are similar to the greek myths in the marshall islands , andromeda , cassiopeia , triangulum , and aries are incorporated into a constellation representing a porpoise andromeda 's bright stars are mostly in the body of the porpoise ; cassiopeia represents its tail and aries its head in the tuamotu islands , alpha andromedae was called takurua-e-te-tuki-hanga-ruki , meaning '' star of the wearisome toil '' , and beta andromedae was called piringa-o-tautu it is an a0p class binary star with an overall apparent visual magnitude of 2.1 and a luminosity of as such , the star was formerly considered to belong to both andromeda and pegasus , and was co-designated as '' delta pegasi ( δ peg ) '' , although this name is no longer formally used β and ( mirach ) is a red-hued giant star of type m0 located in an asterism known as the '' girdle '' μ and is a white-hued main-sequence star of type a5 and magnitude 3.9 the primary is a yellow-hued giant star of type k0 with an apparent magnitude of 5.7 that is 316 light-years away the most famous deep-sky object in andromeda is the spiral galaxy cataloged as messier 31 ( m31 ) or ngc 224 but known colloquially as the andromeda galaxy for the constellation m31 is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye , 2.2 & nbsp ; million light-years from earth ( estimates range up to 2.5 million light-years ) andromeda 's most celebrated open cluster is ngc 752 ( caldwell 28 ) at an overall magnitude of 5.7 the other open cluster in andromeda is ngc 7686 , which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the milky way

from then on , even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing , the woman is a wife , and no longer a bride , and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple in some societies , especially historically , a concubine was a woman who was in an ongoing , usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her , often because of a difference in social status the term wife is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law ( including religious law ) , not to a woman in an informal cohabitation relationship , which may be known as a girlfriend , partner , cohabitant , significant other , concubine , mistress etc however , a woman in a so-called common law marriage may describe herself as a common law wife , de facto wife , or simply a wife those seeking to advance gender neutrality may refer to both marriage partners as '' spouses '' , and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing '' wife '' and '' husband '' with '' spouse '' with regard to annulment , such terms are not , strictly speaking , correct , because annulment , unlike divorce , is usually retroactive , meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place in the case of the death of the other spouse , the term used is widow the social status of such women varies by culture , but in some places , they may be subject to potentially harmful practices , such as widow inheritance or levirate marriage ; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized in some cultures , the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless , as in the case of those cultures that practiced sati , a funeral ritual within some asian communities , in which a recently widowed woman self-immolation , typically on the husband 's funeral pyre the legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century , and still are , in many jurisdictions subject to debate this subject was in particular addressed by john stuart mill , in the subjection of women ( 1869 ) historically , many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives in particular , the control of marital property , inheritance rights , and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage , have typically been given to male marital partners however , this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century , and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender in various marriage laws around the world , however , the husband continues to have authority ; for instance the civil code of iran states at article 1105 : '' in relations between husband and wife ; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband '' traditionally , and still in some parts of the world , the bride or her family bring her husband a dowry , or the husband or his family pay a bride price to the bride 's family , or both are exchanged between the families ; or the husband pays the wife a dower in some cultures , it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family , but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife , the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family ; but during the marriage , the dowry was often made inalienable by the husband in some cultures , particularly in the anglophone west , wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women 's rights , and have restricted or banned it ; for example , since 1983 , when greece adopted a new marriage law which guaranteed gender equality between the spouses , women in greece are required to keep their birth names for their whole life in northern ghana , for example , the payment of bride price signifies a woman 's requirement to bear children , and women using birth control are at risk of threats and coercion many traditions like a dower , dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity therefore , marriage and childbearing was made law between the ages of twenty-five and sixty for men , and twenty and fifty for women noble women were known to marry as young as 12 years of age , beryl rawson , '' the roman family in italy '' ( oxford university press , 1999 ) , p arjava , women and law in late antiquity oxford , 1996 , 133-154 the new testament condemns divorce for both men and women ( 1 cor 7:10–11 ) , and assumes monogamy on the part of the husband : the wife is to have her '' own '' husband , and the husband is to have his '' own '' wife ( 1 cor 7:2 ) as a result , divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern west , particularly in the medieval and early modern period , and husbands in the roman , later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife because wives ' property rights and daughters ' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems , the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly fishman , 2000 if they divorce , she also might receive—or pay—alimony ( see law and divorce around the world ) in hinduism , a woman or man can get married , but only have one husband or wife respectively the holy new testament states that an unmarried christian woman is to celibate or is to become the christian wife of one husband to avoid sexual immorality and for sexual passion ( 1 cor 7:1-2 & 8-9 ) a christian wife can divorce a non-christian husband if he wants a divorce ( 1 cor 7:12-16 ) bride kidnapping fiancée husband marriage personal property or movable property wife acceptance factor wife selling

thumb the original pic was intended to be used with general instrument 's new cp1600 16-bit central processing unit ( cpu ) the cp1600 was a powerful processor for its era , implementing most of the pdp-11 minicomputer 's instruction set architecture in a microcomputer package for cpus that had separate i/o channels , like the intel 8008 , this would not have been a problem , but the 1600 also used the pdp-11 's memory-mapped i/o concept this meant that communicating with a device required the device to watch for key memory locations being accessed on one machine cycle , and then read the data on the next this made i/o on the machine slower as the bus alternated between address and data modes , and more expensive to implement as the devices had to latch inputs over multiple cycles to address this shortcoming of the 1600 , the 8-bit pic was developed in 1975 the idea was that a system would have one or more of the low-cost pics performing the actual i/o with the devices , and then sending that data to the cpu the pic used simple microcode stored in rom to perform its tasks , and although the term risc was not used at the time , it shares some common features with risc designs in 1985 , general instrument sold their microelectronics division and the new owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date the pic , however , was upgraded with an internal eprom to produce a programmable channel i/o ) and program memory from 256 words to 64k words and more ( a '' word '' is one assembly language instruction , varying in length from 8 to 16 bits , depending on the specific pic micro family ) pic and picmicro are now registered trademarks of microchip technology it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' the acronym was quickly replaced with '' programmable intelligent computer '' the microchip 16c84 ( pic16x84 ) , introduced in 1993 , was the first microchip cpu with on-chip eeprom memory by 2013 , microchip was shipping over one billion pic microcontrollers every year pic micro chips are designed with a harvard architecture , and are offered in various device families the baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory , and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory instruction words are in sizes of 12-bit ( pic10 and pic12 ) , 14-bit ( pic16 ) and 24-bit ( pic24 and dspic ) within these families , devices may be designated picnncxxx ( cmos ) or picnnfxxx ( flash ) '' c '' devices are generally classified as '' not suitable for new development '' ( not actively promoted by microchip ) the program memory of '' c '' devices is variously described as otp , rom , or eeprom as of october 2016 , the only otp product classified as '' in production '' is the pic16hv540 '' c '' devices with quartz windows ( for erasure ) , are in general no longer available they are represented by the pic10 series , as well as by some pic12 and pic16 devices note that a call instruction only includes 8 bits of address , and may only specify addresses in the first half of each 512-word page lookup tables are implemented using a computed goto ( assignment to pcl register ) into a table of retlw instructions pic10f32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words , a 64-byte sram register file , and an 8-level deep hardware stack these devices are available in 6-pin smd and 8-pin dip packages ( with two pins unused ) the mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled pic12 and pic16 improvements over earlier cores are 16-bit wide opcodes ( allowing many new instructions ) , and a 16-level deep call stack pic17 devices were produced in packages from 40 to 68 pins a 1-level stack is also available for the status , wreg and bsr registers they are microchip 's first inherently 16-bit microcontrollers software can access rom in 16-bit words , where even words hold the least significant 16 bits of each instruction , and odd words hold the most significant 8 bits the first 8k of ram ) and a single accumulator w0 , with a destination select bit selecting which is updated with the result in november 2007 , microchip introduced the pic32mx family of 32-bit microcontrollers , based on the mips32 m4k core microchip introduced the pic32mk family in 2017 , specialized for motor control , industrial control , industrial internet of things ( iiot ) and multi-channel can applications special-purpose control registers for on-chip hardware resources are also mapped into the data space later series of devices feature move instructions , which can cover the whole addressable space , independent of the selected bank later devices extended this concept with post- and pre- increment/decrement for greater efficiency in accessing sequentially stored data external data memory is not directly addressable except in some pic18 devices with high pin count in general , there is no provision for storing code in external memory due to the lack of an external memory interface the exceptions are pic17 and select high pin count pic18 devices all pics handle ( and address ) data in 8-bit chunks however , the unit of addressability of the code space is not generally the same as the data space in order to be clear , the program memory capacity is usually stated in number of ( single-word ) instructions , rather than in bytes the hardware stack is not software-accessible on earlier devices , but this changed with the 18 series devices pic 's instructions vary from about 35 instructions for the low-end pics to over 80 instructions for the high-end pics pic cores have skip instructions , which are used for conditional execution and branching external interrupts have to be synchronized with the four-clock instruction cycle , otherwise there can be a one instruction cycle jitter while several commercial compilers are available , in 2008 , microchip released their own c compilers , c18 and c30 , for the line of 18f 24f and 30/33f processors they include up to 4096 12-bit words of flash memory and up to 262 bytes of random access memory , an eight bit counter and other support logic in taiwan make a line of microcontrollers based on the pic16 architecture , with 13-bit instructions and a smaller ( 6-bit ) ram address space

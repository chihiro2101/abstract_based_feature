thumb the original pic was intended to be used with general instrument 's new cp1600 16-bit central processing unit ( cpu ) this meant that communicating with a device required the device to watch for key memory locations being accessed on one machine cycle , and then read the data on the next this made i/o on the machine slower as the bus alternated between address and data modes , and more expensive to implement as the devices had to latch inputs over multiple cycles to address this shortcoming of the 1600 , the 8-bit pic was developed in 1975 the pic used simple microcode stored in rom to perform its tasks , and although the term risc was not used at the time , it shares some common features with risc designs in 1985 , general instrument sold their microelectronics division and the new owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date the pic , however , was upgraded with an internal eprom to produce a programmable channel i/o plessey satellite cable tv integrated circuit handbook may 1986 in 1998 microchip introduced the pic 16f84 , a flash programmable and erasable version of its successful serial programmable pic16c84 ) and program memory from 256 words to 64k words and more ( a '' word '' is one assembly language instruction , varying in length from 8 to 16 bits , depending on the specific pic micro family ) pic and picmicro are now registered trademarks of microchip technology it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' by 2013 , microchip was shipping over one billion pic microcontrollers every year pic micro chips are designed with a harvard architecture , and are offered in various device families the baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory , and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory the latest series , pic32mz is a 32-bit mips-based microcontroller instruction words are in sizes of 12-bit ( pic10 and pic12 ) , 14-bit ( pic16 ) and 24-bit ( pic24 and dspic ) the binary representations of the machine instructions vary by family and are shown in pic instruction listings within these families , devices may be designated picnncxxx ( cmos ) or picnnfxxx ( flash ) these devices feature a 12-bit wide code memory , a 32-byte register file , and a tiny two level deep call stack they are represented by the pic10 series , as well as by some pic12 and pic16 devices baseline devices are available in 6-pin to 40-pin packages if banked ram is implemented , the bank number is selected by the high 3 bits of the fsr call and goto instructions specify the low 9 bits of the new code location ; additional high-order bits are taken from the status register pic10f32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words , a 64-byte sram register file , and an 8-level deep hardware stack these devices feature a 14-bit wide code memory , and an improved 8-level deep call stack the instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices , but the two additional opcode bits allow 128 registers and 2048 words of code to be directly addressed the mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled pic12 and pic16 the first 32 bytes of the register space are allocated to special-purpose registers ; the remaining 96 bytes are used for general-purpose ram if banked ram is used , the high 16 registers ( 0x70â€“0x7f ) are global , as are a few of the most important special-purpose registers , including the status register which holds the ram bank select bits improvements over earlier cores are 16-bit wide opcodes ( allowing many new instructions ) , and a 16-level deep call stack they are saved on every interrupt , and may be restored on return the auto increment/decrement feature was improved by removing the control bits and adding four new indirect registers per fsr depending on which indirect file register is being accessed it is possible to postdecrement , postincrement , or preincrement fsr ; or form the effective address by adding w to fsr pic24 devices are designed as general purpose microcontrollers dspic devices include digital signal processing capabilities in addition the program counter is 23 bits wide , but the least significant bit is always 0 , so there are 22 modifiable bits the first 8k of ram ) and a single accumulator w0 , with a destination select bit selecting which is updated with the result the destination and one of the sources also support addressing modes , allowing the operand to be in memory pointed to by a w register the device can be programmed using the microchip mplab c compiler for pic32 mcus , a variant of the gcc compiler in june 2016 , microchip introduced the pic32mm family , specialized for low-power and low-cost applications the pic architecture is characterized by its multiple attributes : separate code and data spaces ( harvard architecture ) there is no distinction between memory space and register space because the ram serves the job of both memory and registers , and the ram is usually just referred to as the register file or simply as the registers later series of devices feature move instructions , which can cover the whole addressable space , independent of the selected bank to implement indirect addressing , a '' file select register '' ( fsr ) and '' indirect register '' ( indf ) are used in general , there is no provision for storing code in external memory due to the lack of an external memory interface for example , pics in the baseline ( pic12 ) and mid-range ( pic16 ) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width , i.e in contrast , in the pic18 series , the program memory is addressed in 8-bit increments ( bytes ) , which differs from the instruction width of 16 bits in order to be clear , the program memory capacity is usually stated in number of ( single-word ) instructions , rather than in bytes the hardware stack is not software-accessible on earlier devices , but this changed with the 18 series devices the instruction set includes instructions to perform a variety of operations on registers directly , the accumulator and a literal constant or the accumulator and a register , as well as for conditional execution , and program branching the risc instruction set of the pic assembly language code can make the overall flow difficult to comprehend devices called '' programmers '' are traditionally used to get program code into the target pic in taiwan make a line of microcontrollers based on the pic16 architecture , with 13-bit instructions and a smaller ( 6-bit ) ram address space ( 1st ed ) microcontroller programming : microchip pic ;

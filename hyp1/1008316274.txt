thumb the original pic was intended to be used with general instrument 's new cp1600 16-bit central processing unit ( cpu ) this made i/o on the machine slower as the bus alternated between address and data modes , and more expensive to implement as the devices had to latch inputs over multiple cycles to address this shortcoming of the 1600 , the 8-bit pic was developed in 1975 the idea was that a system would have one or more of the low-cost pics performing the actual i/o with the devices , and then sending that data to the cpu the pic , however , was upgraded with an internal eprom to produce a programmable channel i/o at the same time plessey in the uk released nmos processors numbered pic1650 and pic1655 based on the gi design , using the same instruction sets , either user mask programmable or versions pre-programed for auto-diallers and keyboard interfaces plessey satellite cable tv integrated circuit handbook may 1986 in 1998 microchip introduced the pic 16f84 , a flash programmable and erasable version of its successful serial programmable pic16c84 today , a huge variety of pics are available with various on-board peripherals ( serial communication modules , uarts , motor control kernels , etc ) and program memory from 256 words to 64k words and more ( a '' word '' is one assembly language instruction , varying in length from 8 to 16 bits , depending on the specific pic micro family ) it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' the microchip 16c84 ( pic16x84 ) , introduced in 1993 , was the first microchip cpu with on-chip eeprom memory the baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory , and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory the latest series , pic32mz is a 32-bit mips-based microcontroller instruction words are in sizes of 12-bit ( pic10 and pic12 ) , 14-bit ( pic16 ) and 24-bit ( pic24 and dspic ) the binary representations of the machine instructions vary by family and are shown in pic instruction listings these devices feature a 12-bit wide code memory , a 32-byte register file , and a tiny two level deep call stack they are represented by the pic10 series , as well as by some pic12 and pic16 devices generally the first 7 to 9 bytes of the register file are special-purpose registers , and the remaining bytes are general purpose ram pointers are implemented using a register pair : after writing an address to the fsr ( file select register ) , the indf ( indirect f ) register becomes an alias for the addressed register this affects register numbers 16–31 ; registers 0–15 are global and not affected by the bank select bits because of the very limited register space ( 5 bits ) , 4 rarely read registers were not assigned addresses , but written by special instructions ( option and tris ) call and goto instructions specify the low 9 bits of the new code location ; additional high-order bits are taken from the status register lookup tables are implemented using a computed goto ( assignment to pcl register ) into a table of retlw instructions pic10f32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words , a 64-byte sram register file , and an 8-level deep hardware stack there are a few additional miscellaneous instructions , and two additional 8-bit literal instructions , add and subtract the first 32 bytes of the register space are allocated to special-purpose registers ; the remaining 96 bytes are used for general-purpose ram ( the other global registers are fsr and indf , the low 8 bits of the program counter pcl , the pc high preload register pclath , and the master interrupt control register intcon ) the pclath register supplies high-order instruction address bits when the 8 bits supplied by a write to the pcl register , or the 11 bits supplied by a goto or call instruction , is not sufficient to address the available rom space improvements over earlier cores are 16-bit wide opcodes ( allowing many new instructions ) , and a 16-level deep call stack pic17 devices were produced in packages from 40 to 68 pins a 1-level stack is also available for the status , wreg and bsr registers pic18 devices are still developed ( 2017 ) and fitted with cip ( core independent peripherals ) in 2001 , microchip introduced the dspic series of chips , which entered mass production in late 2004 the first is like the classic pic instructions , with an operation between a specified f register ( i.e the destination and one of the sources also support addressing modes , allowing the operand to be in memory pointed to by a w register in november 2007 , microchip introduced the pic32mx family of 32-bit microcontrollers , based on the mips32 m4k core the device can be programmed using the microchip mplab c compiler for pic32 mcus , a variant of the gcc compiler today , starting at 28 pin in small qfn packages up to high performance devices with ethernet , can and usb otg , full family range of mid-range 32-bit microcontrollers are available in 2017 , microchip introduced the pic32mz da family , featuring an integrated graphics controller , graphics processor and 32mb of ddr2 dram except pic32 : the mips m4k architecture 's separate data and instruction paths are effectively merged into a single common address space by the system bus matrix module there is no distinction between memory space and register space because the ram serves the job of both memory and registers , and the ram is usually just referred to as the register file or simply as the registers special-purpose control registers for on-chip hardware resources are also mapped into the data space the addressability of memory varies depending on device series , and all pic devices have some bank switching to extend addressing to additional memory to implement indirect addressing , a '' file select register '' ( fsr ) and '' indirect register '' ( indf ) are used later devices extended this concept with post- and pre- increment/decrement for greater efficiency in accessing sequentially stored data however , the unit of addressability of the code space is not generally the same as the data space in order to be clear , the program memory capacity is usually stated in number of ( single-word ) instructions , rather than in bytes pic 's instructions vary from about 35 instructions for the low-end pics to over 80 instructions for the high-end pics the instruction set includes instructions to perform a variety of operations on registers directly , the accumulator and a literal constant or the accumulator and a register , as well as for conditional execution , and program branching they also sell c compilers for the pic10 , pic12 , pic16 , pic18 , pic24 , pic32 and dspic , which integrate cleanly with mplab x devices called '' programmers '' are traditionally used to get program code into the target pic there are many programmers for pic microcontrollers , ranging from the extremely simple designs which rely on icsp to allow direct download of code from a host computer , to intelligent programmers that can verify the device at several supply voltages the intelligent type of programmer is needed to program earlier pic models ( mostly eprom type ) which do not support in-circuit programming holtek make a large number of very cheap microcontrollers ( as low as 8.5 cents in quantity ) with a 14-bit instruction set strikingly similar to the pic16

thumb the original pic was intended to be used with general instrument 's new cp1600 16-bit central processing unit ( cpu ) whilst most people considered the cp1600 a good cpu , it had one significant problem ; to reduce pin count of its physical dip packaging , the address bus and data bus shared pins for cpus that had separate i/o channels , like the intel 8008 , this would not have been a problem , but the 1600 also used the pdp-11 's memory-mapped i/o concept this meant that communicating with a device required the device to watch for key memory locations being accessed on one machine cycle , and then read the data on the next this made i/o on the machine slower as the bus alternated between address and data modes , and more expensive to implement as the devices had to latch inputs over multiple cycles to address this shortcoming of the 1600 , the 8-bit pic was developed in 1975 the pic used simple microcode stored in rom to perform its tasks , and although the term risc was not used at the time , it shares some common features with risc designs in 1985 , general instrument sold their microelectronics division and the new owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date at the same time plessey in the uk released nmos processors numbered pic1650 and pic1655 based on the gi design , using the same instruction sets , either user mask programmable or versions pre-programed for auto-diallers and keyboard interfaces in 2001 , microchip introduced more flash programmable devices , with full production commencing in 2002 today , a huge variety of pics are available with various on-board peripherals ( serial communication modules , uarts , motor control kernels , etc ) and program memory from 256 words to 64k words and more ( a '' word '' is one assembly language instruction , varying in length from 8 to 16 bits , depending on the specific pic micro family ) it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' the microchip 16c84 ( pic16x84 ) , introduced in 1993 , was the first microchip cpu with on-chip eeprom memory pic micro chips are designed with a harvard architecture , and are offered in various device families the baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory , and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory instruction words are in sizes of 12-bit ( pic10 and pic12 ) , 14-bit ( pic16 ) and 24-bit ( pic24 and dspic ) the program memory of '' c '' devices is variously described as otp , rom , or eeprom these devices feature a 12-bit wide code memory , a 32-byte register file , and a tiny two level deep call stack they are represented by the pic10 series , as well as by some pic12 and pic16 devices pointers are implemented using a register pair : after writing an address to the fsr ( file select register ) , the indf ( indirect f ) register becomes an alias for the addressed register if banked ram is implemented , the bank number is selected by the high 3 bits of the fsr because of the very limited register space ( 5 bits ) , 4 rarely read registers were not assigned addresses , but written by special instructions ( option and tris ) call and goto instructions specify the low 9 bits of the new code location ; additional high-order bits are taken from the status register lookup tables are implemented using a computed goto ( assignment to pcl register ) into a table of retlw instructions pic10f32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words , a 64-byte sram register file , and an 8-level deep hardware stack there are a few additional miscellaneous instructions , and two additional 8-bit literal instructions , add and subtract the mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled pic12 and pic16 if banked ram is used , the high 16 registers ( 0x70â€“0x7f ) are global , as are a few of the most important special-purpose registers , including the status register which holds the ram bank select bits ( the other global registers are fsr and indf , the low 8 bits of the program counter pcl , the pc high preload register pclath , and the master interrupt control register intcon ) the pclath register supplies high-order instruction address bits when the 8 bits supplied by a write to the pcl register , or the 11 bits supplied by a goto or call instruction , is not sufficient to address the available rom space improvements over earlier cores are 16-bit wide opcodes ( allowing many new instructions ) , and a 16-level deep call stack unlike the 17 series , it has proven to be very popular , with a large number of device variants presently in manufacture the auto increment/decrement feature was improved by removing the control bits and adding four new indirect registers per fsr depending on which indirect file register is being accessed it is possible to postdecrement , postincrement , or preincrement fsr ; or form the effective address by adding w to fsr pic18 devices are still developed ( 2017 ) and fitted with cip ( core independent peripherals ) the first 8k of ram ) and a single accumulator w0 , with a destination select bit selecting which is updated with the result the first 18 models currently in production ( pic32mx3xx and pic32mx4xx ) are pin to pin compatible and share the same peripherals set with the pic24fxxga0xx family of ( 16-bit ) devices allowing the use of common libraries , software and hardware tools in november 2013 , microchip introduced the pic32mz series of microcontrollers , based on the mips m14k core in june 2016 , microchip introduced the pic32mm family , specialized for low-power and low-cost applications their key advantage is to support the 16bits instructions of mips making program size much more compact ( about 40 % ) microchip introduced the pic32mk family in 2017 , specialized for motor control , industrial control , industrial internet of things ( iiot ) and multi-channel can applications in earlier devices , any register move had to be achieved through the accumulator to implement indirect addressing , a '' file select register '' ( fsr ) and '' indirect register '' ( indf ) are used a register number is written to the fsr , after which reads from or writes to indf will actually be from or to the register pointed to by fsr external data memory is not directly addressable except in some pic18 devices with high pin count the code space is generally implemented as on-chip rom , eprom or flash rom for example , pics in the baseline ( pic12 ) and mid-range ( pic16 ) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width , i.e the 18 series implemented shadow registers , registers which save several important registers during an interrupt , providing hardware support for automatically saving processor state when servicing interrupts these take a register number and a bit number , and perform one of 4 actions : set or clear a bit , and test and skip on set/clear likewise , the original 12-bit instruction set of the pic1650 and its direct descendants has been superseded by 14-bit and 16-bit instruction sets they also sell c compilers for the pic10 , pic12 , pic16 , pic18 , pic24 , pic32 and dspic , which integrate cleanly with mplab x russian pkk milandr produces microcontrollers using the pic17 architecture as the 1886 series in taiwan make a line of microcontrollers based on the pic16 architecture , with 13-bit instructions and a smaller ( 6-bit ) ram address space

thumb the original pic was intended to be used with general instrument 's new cp1600 16-bit central processing unit ( cpu ) to address this shortcoming of the 1600 , the 8-bit pic was developed in 1975 the idea was that a system would have one or more of the low-cost pics performing the actual i/o with the devices , and then sending that data to the cpu the pic used simple microcode stored in rom to perform its tasks , and although the term risc was not used at the time , it shares some common features with risc designs in 1985 , general instrument sold their microelectronics division and the new owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date the pic , however , was upgraded with an internal eprom to produce a programmable channel i/o plessey satellite cable tv integrated circuit handbook may 1986 in 1998 microchip introduced the pic 16f84 , a flash programmable and erasable version of its successful serial programmable pic16c84 in 2001 , microchip introduced more flash programmable devices , with full production commencing in 2002 ) and program memory from 256 words to 64k words and more ( a '' word '' is one assembly language instruction , varying in length from 8 to 16 bits , depending on the specific pic micro family ) it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' the microchip 16c84 ( pic16x84 ) , introduced in 1993 , was the first microchip cpu with on-chip eeprom memory pic micro chips are designed with a harvard architecture , and are offered in various device families the baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory , and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory instruction words are in sizes of 12-bit ( pic10 and pic12 ) , 14-bit ( pic16 ) and 24-bit ( pic24 and dspic ) the binary representations of the machine instructions vary by family and are shown in pic instruction listings the program memory of '' c '' devices is variously described as otp , rom , or eeprom '' c '' devices with quartz windows ( for erasure ) , are in general no longer available they are represented by the pic10 series , as well as by some pic12 and pic16 devices generally the first 7 to 9 bytes of the register file are special-purpose registers , and the remaining bytes are general purpose ram this affects register numbers 16–31 ; registers 0–15 are global and not affected by the bank select bits because of the very limited register space ( 5 bits ) , 4 rarely read registers were not assigned addresses , but written by special instructions ( option and tris ) call and goto instructions specify the low 9 bits of the new code location ; additional high-order bits are taken from the status register pic10f32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words , a 64-byte sram register file , and an 8-level deep hardware stack one input only and three i/o pins are available these devices feature a 14-bit wide code memory , and an improved 8-level deep call stack the instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices , but the two additional opcode bits allow 128 registers and 2048 words of code to be directly addressed the mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled pic12 and pic16 if banked ram is used , the high 16 registers ( 0x70–0x7f ) are global , as are a few of the most important special-purpose registers , including the status register which holds the ram bank select bits ( the other global registers are fsr and indf , the low 8 bits of the program counter pcl , the pc high preload register pclath , and the master interrupt control register intcon the 17 series is not recommended for new designs , and availability may be limited to users improvements over earlier cores are 16-bit wide opcodes ( allowing many new instructions ) , and a 16-level deep call stack in 2000 , microchip introduced the pic18 architecture depending on which indirect file register is being accessed it is possible to postdecrement , postincrement , or preincrement fsr ; or form the effective address by adding w to fsr pic18 devices are still developed ( 2017 ) and fitted with cip ( core independent peripherals ) they are microchip 's first inherently 16-bit microcontrollers pic24 devices are designed as general purpose microcontrollers software can access rom in 16-bit words , where even words hold the least significant 16 bits of each instruction , and odd words hold the most significant 8 bits the program counter is 23 bits wide , but the least significant bit is always 0 , so there are 22 modifiable bits the first is like the classic pic instructions , with an operation between a specified f register ( i.e the device can be programmed using the microchip mplab c compiler for pic32 mcus , a variant of the gcc compiler in 2017 , microchip introduced the pic32mz da family , featuring an integrated graphics controller , graphics processor and 32mb of ddr2 dram the pic32mm microcontrollers use the mips technologies m4k , a 32-bit mips32 processor special-purpose control registers for on-chip hardware resources are also mapped into the data space the addressability of memory varies depending on device series , and all pic devices have some bank switching to extend addressing to additional memory a register number is written to the fsr , after which reads from or writes to indf will actually be from or to the register pointed to by fsr this also allows fsr to be treated almost like a stack pointer ( sp ) in general , there is no provision for storing code in external memory due to the lack of an external memory interface the exceptions are pic17 and select high pin count pic18 devices for example , pics in the baseline ( pic12 ) and mid-range ( pic16 ) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width , i.e the instruction set includes instructions to perform a variety of operations on registers directly , the accumulator and a literal constant or the accumulator and a register , as well as for conditional execution , and program branching they also sell c compilers for the pic10 , pic12 , pic16 , pic18 , pic24 , pic32 and dspic , which integrate cleanly with mplab x after programming the bootloader onto the pic , the user can then reprogram the device using rs232 or usb , in conjunction with specialized computer software they include up to 4096 12-bit words of flash memory and up to 262 bytes of random access memory , an eight bit counter and other support logic russian pkk milandr produces microcontrollers using the pic17 architecture as the 1886 series

thumb the original pic was intended to be used with general instrument 's new cp1600 16-bit central processing unit ( cpu ) the cp1600 was a powerful processor for its era , implementing most of the pdp-11 minicomputer 's instruction set architecture in a microcomputer package for cpus that had separate i/o channels , like the intel 8008 , this would not have been a problem , but the 1600 also used the pdp-11 's memory-mapped i/o concept this meant that communicating with a device required the device to watch for key memory locations being accessed on one machine cycle , and then read the data on the next this made i/o on the machine slower as the bus alternated between address and data modes , and more expensive to implement as the devices had to latch inputs over multiple cycles the pic used simple microcode stored in rom to perform its tasks , and although the term risc was not used at the time , it shares some common features with risc designs in 1985 , general instrument sold their microelectronics division and the new owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date the pic , however , was upgraded with an internal eprom to produce a programmable channel i/o ) and program memory from 256 words to 64k words and more ( a '' word '' is one assembly language instruction , varying in length from 8 to 16 bits , depending on the specific pic micro family ) it is generally thought that pic stands for peripheral interface controller , although general instruments ' original acronym for the initial pic1640 and pic1650 devices was '' programmable interface controller '' the microchip 16c84 ( pic16x84 ) , introduced in 1993 , was the first microchip cpu with on-chip eeprom memory the baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory , and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory instruction words are in sizes of 12-bit ( pic10 and pic12 ) , 14-bit ( pic16 ) and 24-bit ( pic24 and dspic ) the binary representations of the machine instructions vary by family and are shown in pic instruction listings the program memory of '' c '' devices is variously described as otp , rom , or eeprom '' c '' devices with quartz windows ( for erasure ) , are in general no longer available these devices feature a 12-bit wide code memory , a 32-byte register file , and a tiny two level deep call stack they are represented by the pic10 series , as well as by some pic12 and pic16 devices pointers are implemented using a register pair : after writing an address to the fsr ( file select register ) , the indf ( indirect f ) register becomes an alias for the addressed register the rom address space is 512 words ( 12 bits each ) , which may be extended to 2048 words by banking call and goto instructions specify the low 9 bits of the new code location ; additional high-order bits are taken from the status register lookup tables are implemented using a computed goto ( assignment to pcl register ) into a table of retlw instructions pic10f32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words , a 64-byte sram register file , and an 8-level deep hardware stack these devices are available in 6-pin smd and 8-pin dip packages ( with two pins unused ) the instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices , but the two additional opcode bits allow 128 registers and 2048 words of code to be directly addressed the 17 series never became popular and has been superseded by the pic18 architecture ( however , see clones below ) in 2000 , microchip introduced the pic18 architecture in contrast to earlier devices , which were more often than not programmed in assembly , c has become the predominant development language if interrupts are disabled , they may also be used on subroutine call/return by setting the s bit ( appending '' , fast '' to the instruction ) they are microchip 's first inherently 16-bit microcontrollers pic24 devices are designed as general purpose microcontrollers the program counter is 23 bits wide , but the least significant bit is always 0 , so there are 22 modifiable bits ) the second form is more conventional , allowing three operands , which may be any of 16 w registers the destination and one of the sources also support addressing modes , allowing the operand to be in memory pointed to by a w register today , starting at 28 pin in small qfn packages up to high performance devices with ethernet , can and usb otg , full family range of mid-range 32-bit microcontrollers are available in june 2016 , microchip introduced the pic32mm family , specialized for low-power and low-cost applications they are meant for very low power consumption and limited to 25 & nbsp ; mhz the pic architecture is characterized by its multiple attributes : separate code and data spaces ( harvard architecture ) there is no distinction between memory space and register space because the ram serves the job of both memory and registers , and the ram is usually just referred to as the register file or simply as the registers later series of devices feature move instructions , which can cover the whole addressable space , independent of the selected bank a register number is written to the fsr , after which reads from or writes to indf will actually be from or to the register pointed to by fsr the exceptions are pic17 and select high pin count pic18 devices all pics handle ( and address ) data in 8-bit chunks for example , pics in the baseline ( pic12 ) and mid-range ( pic16 ) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width , i.e in contrast , in the pic18 series , the program memory is addressed in 8-bit increments ( bytes ) , which differs from the instruction width of 16 bits in order to be clear , the program memory capacity is usually stated in number of ( single-word ) instructions , rather than in bytes pics have a hardware call stack , which is used to save return addresses hardware support for a general-purpose parameter stack was lacking in early series , but this greatly improved in the 18 series , making the 18 series architecture more friendly to high-level language compilers the instruction set includes instructions to perform a variety of operations on registers directly , the accumulator and a literal constant or the accumulator and a register , as well as for conditional execution , and program branching optimization is facilitated by the relatively large program space of the pic ( e.g a graphical programming language , flowcode , exists capable of programming 8- and 16-bit pic devices and generating pic-compatible c code they include up to 4096 12-bit words of flash memory and up to 262 bytes of random access memory , an eight bit counter and other support logic in taiwan make a line of microcontrollers based on the pic16 architecture , with 13-bit instructions and a smaller ( 6-bit ) ram address space ( 1st ed ) microcontroller programming : microchip pic ;

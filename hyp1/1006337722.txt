it also functions as a signal transducer/integrator to regulate the mapk pathway , reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , as well as intracellular calcium in fact , all cells expend a large fraction of the atp they produce ( typically 30 % and up to 70 % in nerve cells ) to maintain their required cytosolic na and k concentrations for neurons , the na⁺/k⁺-atpase can be responsible for up to 3/4 of the cell 's energy expenditure this was first discovered in red blood cells ( schrier , 1966 ) , but has later been evidenced in renal cells , smooth muscles surrounding the blood vessels , and cardiac purkinje cells recently , glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for na⁺/k⁺-atpases in skeletal muscles , where inhibition of glycogen breakdown ( a substrate for glycolysis ) leads to reduced na⁺/k⁺-atpase activity and lower force production in order to maintain the cell membrane potential , cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell ( intracellular ) the sodium–potassium pump mechanism moves 3 sodium ions out and moves 2 potassium ions in , thus , in total , removing one positive charge carrier from the intracellular space ( please see mechanism for details ) a highly k-permeable ion channel ) for potassium in the membrane , thus the voltage across the plasma membrane is close to the nernst potential of potassium even if both k⁺ and na⁺ ions have the same charge , they can still have very different equilibrium potentials for both outside and/or inside concentrations the sodium-potassium pump moves toward an equilibrium state with the relative concentrations of na⁺ and k⁺ for both inside and outside of cell another important task of the na⁺-k⁺ pump is to provide a na⁺ gradient that is used by certain carrier processes furthermore , when the cell begins to swell , this automatically activates the na⁺-k⁺ pump because it changes the internal concentrations of na⁺-k⁺ to which the pump is sensitive based on this scenario , naktide , a peptide src inhibitor derived from na⁺-k⁺ pump , was developed as a functional ouabain–na⁺-k⁺ pump-mediated signal transduction the pump has a higher affinity for na⁺ ions than k⁺ ions , thus after binding atp , binds 3 intracellular na⁺ ions the phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for na⁺ ions , so they are released ; by contrast it has high affinity for the k⁺ ions na⁺/k⁺-atpase was discovered by jens christian skou in 1957 while working as assistant professor at the department of physiology , university of aarhus , denmark file : scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg mechanism of the sodium–potassium exchange pump .

the na⁺/k⁺-atpase helps maintain resting potential , affects transport , and regulates cellular volume in fact , all cells expend a large fraction of the atp they produce ( typically 30 % and up to 70 % in nerve cells ) to maintain their required cytosolic na and k concentrations for neurons , the na⁺/k⁺-atpase can be responsible for up to 3/4 of the cell 's energy expenditure recently , glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for na⁺/k⁺-atpases in skeletal muscles , where inhibition of glycogen breakdown ( a substrate for glycolysis ) leads to reduced na⁺/k⁺-atpase activity and lower force production in order to maintain the cell membrane potential , cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell ( intracellular ) the sodium–potassium pump mechanism moves 3 sodium ions out and moves 2 potassium ions in , thus , in total , removing one positive charge carrier from the intracellular space ( please see mechanism for details ) a highly k-permeable ion channel ) for potassium in the membrane , thus the voltage across the plasma membrane is close to the nernst potential of potassium the sodium-potassium pump moves toward an equilibrium state with the relative concentrations of na⁺ and k⁺ for both inside and outside of cell for instance , the concentration of k⁺ in cytosol is 100mm , whereas the concentration of na⁺ is 10mm another important task of the na⁺-k⁺ pump is to provide a na⁺ gradient that is used by certain carrier processes the na⁺-k⁺ pump helps to maintain the right concentrations of ions furthermore , when the cell begins to swell , this automatically activates the na⁺-k⁺ pump because it changes the internal concentrations of na⁺-k⁺ to which the pump is sensitive based on this scenario , naktide , a peptide src inhibitor derived from na⁺-k⁺ pump , was developed as a functional ouabain–na⁺-k⁺ pump-mediated signal transduction the na⁺-k⁺ pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar purkinje neurons , olfactory bulb mitral cells and probably other neuron types alcohol inhibits sodium–potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body coordination the pump has a higher affinity for na⁺ ions than k⁺ ions , thus after binding atp , binds 3 intracellular na⁺ ions the unphosphorylated form of the pump has a higher affinity for na⁺ ions

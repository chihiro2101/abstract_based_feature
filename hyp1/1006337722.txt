in fact , all cells expend a large fraction of the atp they produce ( typically 30 % and up to 70 % in nerve cells ) to maintain their required cytosolic na and k concentrations recently , glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for na⁺/k⁺-atpases in skeletal muscles , where inhibition of glycogen breakdown ( a substrate for glycolysis ) leads to reduced na⁺/k⁺-atpase activity and lower force production in order to maintain the cell membrane potential , cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell ( intracellular ) the sodium–potassium pump mechanism moves 3 sodium ions out and moves 2 potassium ions in , thus , in total , removing one positive charge carrier from the intracellular space ( please see mechanism for details ) a highly k-permeable ion channel ) for potassium in the membrane , thus the voltage across the plasma membrane is close to the nernst potential of potassium even if both k⁺ and na⁺ ions have the same charge , they can still have very different equilibrium potentials for both outside and/or inside concentrations the sodium-potassium pump moves toward an equilibrium state with the relative concentrations of na⁺ and k⁺ for both inside and outside of cell another important task of the na⁺-k⁺ pump is to provide a na⁺ gradient that is used by certain carrier processes the na⁺-k⁺ pump helps to maintain the right concentrations of ions furthermore , when the cell begins to swell , this automatically activates the na⁺-k⁺ pump because it changes the internal concentrations of na⁺-k⁺ to which the pump is sensitive based on this scenario , naktide , a peptide src inhibitor derived from na⁺-k⁺ pump , was developed as a functional ouabain–na⁺-k⁺ pump-mediated signal transduction na⁺-k⁺ pump also interacts with ankyrin , ip3r , pi3k , plc-gamma and cofilin the pump has a higher affinity for na⁺ ions than k⁺ ions , thus after binding atp , binds 3 intracellular na⁺ ions the pump binds 2 extracellular k⁺ ions in certain conditions such as in the case of cardiac disease , the na⁺/k⁺-atpase may need to be inhibited via pharmacological means in 1997 , he received one-half of the nobel prize in chemistry '' for the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme , na⁺ , k⁺-atpase file : scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg mechanism of the sodium–potassium exchange pump .

'happiness ' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy states that '' an important project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what various writers are talking about ) international differences in well-being , 2010 , oxford university press , new york , the word is mostly used in relation to two factors : the current experience of the feeling of an emotion ( affect ) such as pleasure or joy , or of a more general sense of 'emotional condition as a whole' dan haybron ( , ; '' i would suggest that when we talk about happiness , we are actually referring , much of the time , to a complex emotional phenomenon call it emotional well-being happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods , more broadly your emotional condition as a whole on this view , we can think of happiness , loosely , as the opposite of anxiety and depression being in good spirits , quick to laugh and slow to anger , at peace and untroubled , confident and comfortable in your own skin , engaged , energetic and full of life '' haybron has also used the term thymic , by which he means 'overall mood state ' in this context ; xavier landes has described a similar concept of mood '' people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives for instance ruut veenhoven has defined happiness as '' overall appreciation of one 's life as-a-whole '' , 1.1 2011 , '' ‘ happiness ’ is often used , in ordinary life , to refer to a short-lived state of a person , frequently a feeling of contentment : ‘ you look happy today ’ ; ‘ i ’ m very happy for you ’ and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable “ people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives 'can happiness be measured ' , action for happiness , includes measures of current experience ( emotions , moods , and feelings ) and of life satisfaction see subjective well-being components of swb for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as “ the experience of joy , contentment , or positive well-being , combined with a sense that one 's life is good , meaningful , and worthwhile ” the how of happiness , lyubomirsky , 2007 eudaimonia , is a greek term variously translated as happiness , welfare , flourishing , and blessedness xavier landes has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective wellbeing , mood and eudaimonia '' mark baum character , the big short ( film ) , for instance the correlation of income levels has been shown to be substantial with life satisfaction measures , but to be far weaker , at least above a certain threshold , with current experience measures if the results hold up , the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction , but weakly related to emotional well-being , at least above a certain threshold the good news is that the answers differ in ways that suggest that people understand what they are being asked , and answer appropriately a further issue is when measurement is made ; appraisal of a level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date some users accept these issues , but continue to use the word because of its convening power '' some have argued that it is misleading to use ‘ happiness ’ as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally while ‘ subjective well-being ’ is more precise , it simply does not have the convening power of ‘ happiness ’ the main linguistic argument for using happiness in a broader generic role is that happiness plays two important roles within the science of well-being , appearing once as a prototypical positive emotion and again as part of a cognitive life evaluation question evaluative answers , in response to questions about life as a whole , are supported by positive emotions , as noted above , but also driven much more , than are answers to questions about emotions , by a variety of life circumstances , including income , health and social trust happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life , but in terms of individual psychology eudaimonia ( greek : εὐδαιμονία ) is a classical greek word consists of the word '' eu '' ( '' good '' or '' well-being '' ) and '' daimōn '' ( '' spirit '' or '' minor deity '' , used by extension to mean one 's lot or fortune ) thus understood , the happy life is the good life , that is , a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way specifically , aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity friedrich nietzsche critiqued the english utilitarians ' focus on attaining the greatest happiness , stating that '' man does not strive for happiness , only the englishman does '' nietzsche meant that making happiness one 's ultimate goal and the aim of one 's existence , in his words '' makes one contemptible not all cultures seek to maximise happiness , see the work of jeanne tsai see life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness meaning of '' happiness '' ref people in countries with high cultural religiosity tend to relate their life satisfaction less to their emotional experiences than people in more secular countries more mundane forms of happiness , such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships , are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people ( see sukha ) buddhism also encourages the generation of metta and karuṇā , the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings more specifically , he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues , especially through music augustine and thomas aquinas , man 's last end is happiness : '' all men agree in desiring the last end , which is happiness '' however , where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness , aquinas agreed with aristotle that happiness can not be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts , but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts , such as habits according to virtue '' so : '' therefore the last and perfect happiness , which we await in the life to come , consists entirely in contemplation but imperfect happiness , such as can be had here , consists first and principally in contemplation , but secondarily , in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions '' human complexities , like reason and cognition , can produce well-being or happiness , but such form is limited and transitory beatitudo , or perfect happiness , as complete well-being , is to be attained not in this life , but the next if you seek it , you wo n't find it , because seeking is the antithesis of happiness ” eckhart tolle , a new earth : awakening to your life 's purpose in subjective well-being measures , the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports although these factors play a role in happiness , they do not all need to act in simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness research on positive psychology , well-being , eudaimonia and happiness , and the theories of diener , ryff , keyes , and seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics , including '' the biological , personal , relational , institutional , cultural , and global dimensions of life

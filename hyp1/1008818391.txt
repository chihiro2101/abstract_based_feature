'happiness ' is the subject of debate on usage and meaning , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy states that '' an important project in the philosophy of happiness is simply getting clear on what various writers are talking about '' how universal is happiness ? '' ruut veenhoven , chapter 11 in ed diener , john f dan haybron ( , ; '' i would suggest that when we talk about happiness , we are actually referring , much of the time , to a complex emotional phenomenon happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods , more broadly your emotional condition as a whole on this view , we can think of happiness , loosely , as the opposite of anxiety and depression being in good spirits , quick to laugh and slow to anger , at peace and untroubled , confident and comfortable in your own skin , engaged , energetic and full of life '' haybron has also used the term thymic , by which he means 'overall mood state ' in this context ; xavier landes has described a similar concept of mood for instance daniel kahneman has defined happiness as '' what i experience here and now '' '' people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable the point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one , even though they lacked contentment “ people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives 'can happiness be measured ' , action for happiness , includes measures of current experience ( emotions , moods , and feelings ) and of life satisfaction 17 for positive affect , –.09 for negative affect ; and in the united states , essentially zero above 75,000 ( though quite strong at low income levels ) if the results hold up , the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction , but weakly related to emotional well-being , at least above a certain threshold the implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context , '' how does happiness come into this classification ? for better or worse , it enters in three ways the good news is that the answers differ in ways that suggest that people understand what they are being asked , and answer appropriately '' some have argued that it is misleading to use ‘ happiness ’ as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally while ‘ subjective well-being ’ is more precise , it simply does not have the convening power of ‘ happiness ’ this double use has sometimes been used to argue that there is no coherent structure to happiness responses the converse argument made in the world happiness reports is that this double usage helps to justify using happiness in a generic role , as long as the alternative meanings are clearly understood and credibly related answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment traditional european societies , inherited from the greeks and from christianity , often linked happiness with morality , which was concerned with the performance in a certain kind of role in a certain kind of social life however , with the rise of individualism , begotten partly by protestantism and capitalism , the links between duty in a society and happiness were gradually broken happiness is no longer defined in relation to social life , but in terms of individual psychology for aristotle the term eudaimonia , which is translated as 'happiness ' or 'flourishing ' is an activity rather than an emotion or a state thus understood , the happy life is the good life , that is , a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way specifically , aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity according to aristotle , the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life aristotle argued a second best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue '' he introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the '' last man '' as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers these small , '' last men '' who seek after only their own pleasure and health , avoiding all danger , exertion , difficulty , challenge , struggle are meant to seem contemptible to nietzsche 's reader in 2004 darrin mcmahon claimed , that over time the emphasis shifted from the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness for instance western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century not all cultures seek to maximise happiness , see the work of jeanne tsai see life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness meaning of '' happiness '' ref for ultimate freedom from dukkha , the noble eightfold path leads its practitioner to nirvana , a state of everlasting peace ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming taṇhā in all forms buddhism also encourages the generation of metta and karuṇā , the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings in advaita vedanta , the ultimate goal of life is happiness , in the sense that duality between atman and brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the self in all a popular teaching by rabbi nachman of breslov , a 19th-century chassidic rabbi , is '' mitzvah gedolah le'hiyot besimcha tamid , '' it is a great mitzvah ( commandment ) to always be in a state of happiness when a person is happy they are much more capable of serving god and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset in turn , which habits and acts that normally lead to happiness is according to aquinas caused by laws : natural law and divine law '' so : '' therefore the last and perfect happiness , which we await in the life to come , consists entirely in contemplation experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory , but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being happiness is evaluated , as in “ how happy are you with your life as a whole ? ” , and in emotional reports , as in “ how happy are you now ? , ” and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts libertarian think tank cato institute claims that economic freedom correlates strongly with happiness in pursuit of happiness research mental health and relationships 'key to happiness ' bbc in the uk richard layard and others have led the development of happiness economics

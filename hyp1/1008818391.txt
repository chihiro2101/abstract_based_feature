'' ruut veenhoven , chapter 11 in ed diener , john f dan haybron ( , ; '' i would suggest that when we talk about happiness , we are actually referring , much of the time , to a complex emotional phenomenon happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods , more broadly your emotional condition as a whole to be happy is to inhabit a favorable emotional state being in good spirits , quick to laugh and slow to anger , at peace and untroubled , confident and comfortable in your own skin , engaged , energetic and full of life '' haybron has also used the term thymic , by which he means 'overall mood state ' in this context ; xavier landes has described a similar concept of mood '' people don ’ t want to be happy the way i ’ ve defined the term – what i experience here and now in my view , it ’ s much more important for them to be satisfied , to experience life satisfaction , from the perspective of ‘ what i remember , ’ of the story they tell about their lives for instance ruut veenhoven has defined happiness as '' overall appreciation of one 's life as-a-whole '' , 1.1 2011 , '' ‘ happiness ’ is often used , in ordinary life , to refer to a short-lived state of a person , frequently a feeling of contentment : ‘ you look happy today ’ ; ‘ i ’ m very happy for you ’ and in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person ’ s life , or of their happy life , even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable subjective well-being ( swb ) see e.g 'can happiness be measured ' , action for happiness , includes measures of current experience ( emotions , moods , and feelings ) and of life satisfaction see subjective well-being components of swb for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as “ the experience of joy , contentment , or positive well-being , combined with a sense that one 's life is good , meaningful , and worthwhile 44 in the global sample ) , at all levels , with life satisfaction—strictly speaking , a “ life evaluation ” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied 17 for positive affect , –.09 for negative affect ; and in the united states , essentially zero above 75,000 ( though quite strong at low income levels ) '' john helliwell and shun yang , p11 , world happiness report 2012 qualifying happiness as a polysemy and a fuzzy concept a further issue is when measurement is made ; appraisal of a level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date '' some have argued that it is misleading to use ‘ happiness ’ as a generic term to cover subjective well-being more generally while ‘ subjective well-being ’ is more precise , it simply does not have the convening power of ‘ happiness ’ answers to questions about the emotion of happiness relate well to what is happening at the moment evaluative answers , in response to questions about life as a whole , are supported by positive emotions , as noted above , but also driven much more , than are answers to questions about emotions , by a variety of life circumstances , including income , health and social trust helliwell and others , world happiness report , 2015 , quoted in what 's special about happiness as a social indicator ?

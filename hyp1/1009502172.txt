the burning of books has a long history as a tool that has been wielded by authorities both secular and religion , in their efforts to suppress dissenting or heresy views that are believed to pose a threat to the prevailing order according to the tanakh ( hebrew bible ) , in the 7th century bce king jehoiakim of judah burned part of a scroll that baruch ben neriah had written at prophet jeremiah 's dictation ( jeremiah 36 ) burning of books and burying of scholars in china ( 210–213 bce ) in 213 bce qin shi huang , the first emperor of the qin dynasty , ordered the burning of books and burying of scholars and in 210 bce he supposedly ordered the live burial of 460 confucian scholars in order to stay on his throne though the burning of books is well established , the live burial of scholars has been disputed by modern historians who doubt the details of the story , which first appeared more than a century later in the han dynasty official sima qian 's records of the grand historian some of these books were written in shang xiang , a superior school founded in 2208 bce many of them also which used curious arts , brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver issued an easter letter in which he demanded that egyptian monks destroy all such unacceptable writings , except for those he specifically listed as 'acceptable ' even 'canonical'—a list that constitutes the present 'new testament ' '' according to author rebecca knuth , multitudes of early christian texts have been as thoroughly '' destroyed '' as if they had been publicly burnt burning books and leveling libraries , p . burning of nestorian books which facts demonstrate that constantine 's edict on arian works was not rigorously observed , as arian writings or the theology based on them survived to be burned much later in spain in 1244 , as an outcome of the disputation of paris , twenty-four carriage loads of talmuds and other jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire by french law officers in the streets of paris . burning of aztec and mayan manuscripts in the 1560s during the conquest of the americas and in the aftermath of the encounter between european and indigenous american civilizations , many books written by indigenous peoples were destroyed however , most were destroyed by the conquistadors and the catholic priests , with the exception of the work of the priest bartolome de la casas in particular , many books in yucatán were ordered destroyed by diego de landa in july 1562 '' ironically , most of the books that were destroyed by the europeans were biased and based upon the aztec people 's version of the history of the region the aztecs had previously conquered the area and destroyed many of the mayan books and documents '' over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries book burning developed from a rare to an occasional occurrence , relocated from an outdoor to an indoor procedure , and changed from a bureaucratic to a quasi-theatrical performance '' burning of the us library of congress although there were dissenting voices to this wanton destruction , the conflagration was motivated by a strong desire on the part of the british to humiliate the americans main : nazi book burnings the nazi government decreed broad grounds for burning material : in 1588 , the exiled english catholic william cardinal allen wrote '' an admonition to the nobility and people of england '' , a work sharply attacking queen elizabeth i upon the defeat of the armada , allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire , and it is only known of through one of elizabeth 's spies , who had stolen a copy the hassidic rabbi nachman of breslov is reported to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808 nikolai gogol burned the second half of his magnum opus dead souls , having come under the influence of a priest who persuaded him that his work was sinful ; gogol later described this as a mistake to judge from surviving dickens letters , the destroyed material – even if not intended for publication – might have had considerable literary merit joe shuster , who together with jerry siegel created the fictional superhero superman , in 1938 burned the first superman story when under the impression that it would not find a publisher lewis resigned from magdalene college , cambridge and his rooms there were being cleaned out , lewis gave instructions to douglas gresham to destroy all his unfinished or incomplete fragments of manuscript - which scholars researching lewis ' work regard as a grievous loss however , no such symphony was ever performed , and the only concrete evidence of the symphony 's existence on paper is a 1933 bill for a fair copy of the first movement and short draft fragments first published and played in 2011 '' since no manuscript survives , sources consider it likely that sibelius destroyed most traces of the score , probably in 1945 , during which year he certainly consigned a great many papers to the flames my husband collected a number of the manuscripts in a laundry basket and burned them on the open fire in the dining room parts of the karelia suite were destroyed – i later saw remains of the pages which had been torn out – and many other things axel jensen made his debut as a novelist in oslo in 1955 with the novel dyretemmerens kors , but he later burned the remaining unsold copies of the book books saved from burning in art , she is commonly represented holding a book to signify the library she saved , and is considered a patron saint of library and librarians aziza jafarzade , '' memoirs of 1937 : burning our books , the arabic script goes up in flames , '' in azerbaijan international , vol book burnings were regularly organised in nazi germany in the 1930s by stormtroopers so that '' degenerate '' works could be destroyed , especially works written by jewish authors such as thomas mann , marcel proust , and karl marx hesitant to make the accusation against kvavik public because it would greatly harm his career , even if it was proven to be false , the media did not divulge his name until his house was searched by police staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books , documents about the boer wars , and contemporary materials which were both for and against apartheid reported as '' just like the ritual burning of books in nazi germany '' , a book-burning ceremony was held by students of the '' socially harmful cult '' universal medicine , an esoteric healing business which was owned by serge benhayon in the she-ra : princess of power episode '' book burning , '' the horde burned all the village of ruxtown ’ s books lost memory – libraries and archives destroyed in the twentieth century books on fire : the destruction of libraries throughout history bosmajian '' bannings and burnings in history '' – book and periodical council ( canada ) '' the books have been burning : timeline '' by daniel schwartz , cbc news

before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable while the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs , because setup costs are much greater for offset printing pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock , reducing storage , handling costs , and inventory accounting costs many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters ( often as a single copy ) when they are needed the introduction of pod technologies and business models has created a range of new book creation and publishing opportunities pod creates a new category of publishing ( or printing ) company that offers services , usually for a fee , directly to authors who wish to self-publish pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers among traditional publishers , pod services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out , but another has not yet become available pod allows a publisher to use cheaper conventional printing to produce enough copies to satisfy a pessimistic forecast of the publication sales , and then rely on pod to make up the difference an academic publisher may be expected to keep these specialist works in print even though the target market is almost saturated , making further conventional print jobs uneconomic lesser royalties come from traditional bookshops and online retailers , both of which buy at high discount , although some pod companies allow the publisher or author to set their own discount level because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs

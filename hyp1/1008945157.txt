before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order while the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs , because setup costs are much greater for offset printing pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing large inventories of a book or print material do not need to be kept in stock , reducing storage , handling costs , and inventory accounting costs many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies other services may also be available , including formatting , proofreading , and editing , but such companies typically do not spend money for marketing , unlike conventional publishers pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers among traditional publishers , pod services can be used to make sure that books remain available when one print job has sold out , but another has not yet become available an academic publisher may be expected to keep these specialist works in print even though the target market is almost saturated , making further conventional print jobs uneconomic print on demand also allows books to be printed in a variety of formats because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs stocked books are usually also available through '' sale or return '' , meaning that the book store can return unsold stock for full credit as much as one year after the initial sale when a customer wants to purchase one of these books , they are less likely to follow through with the sale because they do not get the book that day

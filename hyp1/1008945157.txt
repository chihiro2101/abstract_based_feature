before the introduction of digital printing technology , production of small numbers of publications had many limitations large print jobs were not a problem , but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine and to print on a teletypewriter , line printer or other computer printer , but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable print on demand with digital technology is a way to print items for a fixed cost per copy , regardless of the size of the order while the unit price of each physical copy is greater than with offset printing , the average cost is lower for very small print jobs , because setup costs are much greater for offset printing pod has other business benefits besides lesser costs ( for small jobs ) : technical set-up is usually quicker than for offset printing many publishers use pod for other printing needs other than books such as galley proof , catalogs and review copies digital technology is ideally suited to publish small print jobs of posters ( often as a single copy ) when they are needed the introduction of ultraviolet-curable inks and media for large-format inkjet printers has allowed artists , photographers and owners of image collections to take advantage of print on demand pod creates a new category of publishing ( or printing ) company that offers services , usually for a fee , directly to authors who wish to self-publish the initial investment required for pod services is less than for offset printing pod publishing gives authors editorial independence , speed to market , ability to revise content , and greater financial return per copy than royalties paid by conventional publishers many major publishers print on demand as a way to save money pod allows a publisher to use cheaper conventional printing to produce enough copies to satisfy a pessimistic forecast of the publication sales , and then rely on pod to make up the difference many of the smallest small presses , often known as micro-presses because they have inconsequential profits , have become reliant on pod technology and ebooks because the per-unit cost is typically greater with pod than with a print job of thousands of copies , it is common for pod books to be more expensive than similar books made by conventional print jobs , especially if a book is produced exclusively with pod instead of using pod as a supplemental technology between print jobs

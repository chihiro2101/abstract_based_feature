acer platanoides is a deciduous tree , growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter , and a broad , rounded crown the leaf are opposite , palmately lobed with five lobes , long and ( rarely across ; the lobes each bear one to three side teeth , and an otherwise smooth margin under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years especially when used on streets , it can have insufficient space for its root network and is prone to the roots wrapping around themselves , girdling and killing the tree the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes it is also frequently confused with the more distantly related acer saccharum ( sugar maple ) the tips of the points on norway maple leaves reduce to a fine '' hair '' , while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are , on close inspection , rounded on mature trees , sugar maple bark is more shaggy , while norway maple bark has small , often criss-crossing grooves while the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species , the leaf lobes of norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape , in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples the fruits of norway maple are paired samaras with widely diverging wings , distinguishing them from those of sycamore , acer pseudoplatanus which are at 90 degrees to each other norway maple does not require freezing temperatures for proper growth , however it is adapted to higher latitudes with long summer days and does not perform well when planted south of the 37th parallel , the approximate southern limit of its range in europe by comparison , in its native range , norway maple is rarely a dominant species and instead occurs mostly as a scattered understory tree the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the larvae of a number of species of lepidoptera feed on norway maple foliage

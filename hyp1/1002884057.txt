acer platanoides is a deciduous tree , growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter , and a broad , rounded crown under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes the sugar maple is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole ( leaf stem ) ; norway maple petioles have white sap the tips of the points on norway maple leaves reduce to a fine '' hair '' , while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are , on close inspection , rounded on mature trees , sugar maple bark is more shaggy , while norway maple bark has small , often criss-crossing grooves while the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species , the leaf lobes of norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape , in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples as with most maples , norway maple is normally dioecious ( separate male and female trees ) , occasionally monoecious , and trees may change gender from year to year norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose the sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color , where the norway maple is usually yellow , although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange this species as grown in the former yugoslavia is also called bosnian maple , and is probably the maple used by the famous italian violin makers , stradivari and guarneri norway maples are not typically cultivated for maple syrup production due to the lower sugar content of the sap compared to sugar maple the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple , allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species ectoedemia sericopeza , the norway maple seedminer , is a moth of the family nepticulidae

acer platanoides is a deciduous tree , growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter , and a broad , rounded crown under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes the tips of the points on norway maple leaves reduce to a fine '' hair '' , while the tips of the points on sugar maple leaves are , on close inspection , rounded while the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species , the leaf lobes of norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape , in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on sugar maples flowering and seed production begins at ten years of age , however large quantities of seeds are not produced until the tree is 20 as with most maples , norway maple is normally dioecious ( separate male and female trees ) , occasionally monoecious , and trees may change gender from year to year the fruits of norway maple are paired samaras with widely diverging wings , distinguishing them from those of sycamore , acer pseudoplatanus which are at 90 degrees to each other norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose the sugar maple usually has a brighter orange autumn color , where the norway maple is usually yellow , although some of the red-leaved cultivars appear more orange the heavy seed crop and high germination rate contributes to its invasiveness in north america , where it forms dense monotypic stands that choke out native vegetation by comparison , in its native range , norway maple is rarely a dominant species and instead occurs mostly as a scattered understory tree as an invasive species in north america platanoides has been shown to inhibit the growth of native saplings as a canopy tree or as a sapling

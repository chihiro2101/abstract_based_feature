acer platanoides is a deciduous tree , growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter , and a broad , rounded crown under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years in addition , their roots tend to be quite shallow and thereby they easily out-compete nearby plants for nutrient uptake other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes the sugar maple is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole ( leaf stem ) ; norway maple petioles have white sap on mature trees , sugar maple bark is more shaggy , while norway maple bark has small , often criss-crossing grooves the fruits of norway maple are paired samaras with widely diverging wings , distinguishing them from those of sycamore , acer pseudoplatanus which are at 90 degrees to each other norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose platanoides seeds require only three months of exposure to temperatures lower than and will sprout in early spring , around the same time that leafout begins by comparison , in its native range , norway maple is rarely a dominant species and instead occurs mostly as a scattered understory tree this species as grown in the former yugoslavia is also called bosnian maple , and is probably the maple used by the famous italian violin makers , stradivari and guarneri norway maple has been widely taken into cultivation in other areas , including western europe northwest of its native range history and range of norway maple during the 1950sâ€“60s it became popular as a street tree due to the large-scale loss of american elms from dutch elm disease the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the norway maple also suffers less herbivory than the sugar maple , allowing it to gain a competitive advantage against the latter species

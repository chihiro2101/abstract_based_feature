acer platanoides is a deciduous tree , growing to tall with a trunk up to in diameter , and a broad , rounded crown the flowers are in corymbs of 15â€“30 together , yellow to yellow-green with five sepals and five petals long ; flowering occurs in early spring before the new leaves emerge under ideal conditions in its native range , norway maple may live up to 250 years , but often has a much shorter life expectancy ; in north america , for example , sometimes only 60 years in addition , their roots tend to be quite shallow and thereby they easily out-compete nearby plants for nutrient uptake the norway maple is a member ( and is the type species ) of the section platanoidea pax , characterised by flattened , disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap other related species in this section include acer campestre ( field maple ) , acer cappadocicum ( cappadocian maple ) , acer lobelii ( lobel 's maple ) , and acer truncatum ( shandong maple ) from the field maple , the norway maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed , not blunt , lobes , and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes the sugar maple is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole ( leaf stem ) ; norway maple petioles have white sap on mature trees , sugar maple bark is more shaggy , while norway maple bark has small , often criss-crossing grooves as with most maples , norway maple is normally dioecious ( separate male and female trees ) , occasionally monoecious , and trees may change gender from year to year norway maple seeds are flattened , while those of sugar maple are globose depending on the latitude , leaf drop may vary by as much as three weeks , beginning in the second week of october in scandinavia and the first week of november in southern europe norway maples are not typically cultivated for maple syrup production due to the lower sugar content of the sap compared to sugar maple the norway maple was introduced to northeastern north america between 1750 and 1760 as an ornamental shade tree the larvae of a number of species of lepidoptera feed on norway maple foliage ectoedemia sericopeza , the norway maple seedminer , is a moth of the family nepticulidae

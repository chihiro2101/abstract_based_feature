the sponsors of both the banking act of 1933 and the glass–steagall act of 1932 were southern democrats : senator carter glass of virginia ( who by 1932 had served in the house or the senate , or as the secretary of the treasury for the preceding 30 years ) ; and representative henry b between 1930 and 1932 , senator carter glass ( d-va ) introduced several versions of a bill ( known in each version as the glass bill ) to regulate or prohibit the combination of commercial and investment banking and to establish other reforms ( except deposit insurance ) similar to the final provisions of the 1933 banking act the senate passed a version of the glass bill that would have required commercial banks to eliminate their securities affiliates the final glass–steagall provisions contained in the 1933 banking act reduced from five years to one year the period in which commercial banks were required to eliminate such affiliations although the deposit insurance provisions of the 1933 banking act were very controversial , and drew veto threats from president franklin delano roosevelt , president roosevelt supported the glass–steagall provisions separating commercial and investment banking , and representative steagall included those provisions in his house bill that differed from senator glass 's senate bill primarily in its deposit insurance provisions many accounts of the act identify the pecora commission as important in leading to the act , particularly its glass–steagall provisions , becoming law while supporters of the glass–steagall separation of commercial and investment banking cite the pecora investigation as supporting that separation , perino 2010 glass–steagall critics have argued that the evidence from the pecora investigation did not support the separation of commercial and investment banking this source states that senator glass proposed many versions of his bill to congress known as the glass bills in the two years prior to the glass–steagall act being passed in may 1933 , steagall 's addition of allowing state-chartered banks to receive federal deposit insurance and shortening the time in which banks needed to eliminate securities affiliates to one year was known as the driving force of what helped the glass–steagall act to be signed into law the law gave banks one year after the law was passed on june 16 , 1933 to decide whether they would be a commercial bank or an investment bank while permitting affiliations between securities firms and companies other than federal reserve member banks , glass–steagall distinguished between what a federal reserve member bank could do directly and what an affiliate could do with the exception of commercial banks being allowed to underwrite government-issued bonds , commercial banks could only have 10 percent of their income come from securities as time passed , however , the separation became so controversial that in 1935 , senator glass himself attempted to '' repeal '' the prohibition on direct bank underwriting by permitting a limited amount of bank underwriting of corporate debt financial sector firms established a favorable view of deregulation in american political circles , and in using its political influence in congress to overturn key provisions of glass-steagall and to dismantle other major provisions of statutes and regulations that govern financial firms and the risks they may take white , for instance , noted that '' it was not commercial banks ' investment banking activities , such as underwriting and dealing in securities , that did them in '' vandenberg commodity futures modernization act of 2000 corporate law decline of the glass–steagall act subprime mortgage crisis systemic risk

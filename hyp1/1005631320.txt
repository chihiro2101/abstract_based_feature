the sponsors of both the banking act of 1933 and the glass–steagall act of 1932 were southern democrats : senator carter glass of virginia ( who by 1932 had served in the house or the senate , or as the secretary of the treasury for the preceding 30 years ) ; and representative henry b between 1930 and 1932 , senator carter glass ( d-va ) introduced several versions of a bill ( known in each version as the glass bill ) to regulate or prohibit the combination of commercial and investment banking and to establish other reforms ( except deposit insurance ) similar to the final provisions of the 1933 banking act it received extensive critiques and comments from bankers , economists , and the federal reserve board the senate passed a version of the glass bill that would have required commercial banks to eliminate their securities affiliates the final glass–steagall provisions contained in the 1933 banking act reduced from five years to one year the period in which commercial banks were required to eliminate such affiliations while supporters of the glass–steagall separation of commercial and investment banking cite the pecora investigation as supporting that separation , perino 2010 glass–steagall critics have argued that the evidence from the pecora investigation did not support the separation of commercial and investment banking this source states that senator glass proposed many versions of his bill to congress known as the glass bills in the two years prior to the glass–steagall act being passed the glass–steagall separation of commercial and investment banking was in four sections of the 1933 banking act ( sections 16 , 20 , 21 , and 32 ) together , they prevented commercial federal reserve member banks from : dealing in non-governmental securities for customers investing in non-investment grade securities for themselves underwriting or distributing non-governmental securities affiliating ( or sharing employees ) with companies involved in such activities conversely , glass–steagall prevented securities firms and investment banks from taking deposits s & ls and securities firms took advantage of these loopholes starting in the 1960s to create products and affiliated companies that chipped away at commercial banks ' deposit and lending businesses whereas a federal reserve member bank could not buy , sell , underwrite , or deal in any security except as specifically permitted by section 16 , such a bank could affiliate with a company so long as that company was not '' engaged principally '' in such activities as time passed , however , the separation became so controversial that in 1935 , senator glass himself attempted to '' repeal '' the prohibition on direct bank underwriting by permitting a limited amount of bank underwriting of corporate debt white , for instance , noted that '' it was not commercial banks ' investment banking activities , such as underwriting and dealing in securities , that did them in '' because the federal reserve 's interpretations of the act had already weakened restrictions previously in place , commentators did not find much significance in the repeal , especially of sections 20 and 32 instead , the five year anniversary of its repeal was marked by numerous sources explaining that the glba had not significantly changed the market structure of the banking and securities industries following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 , legislators unsuccessfully tried to reinstate glass–steagall sections 20 and 32 as part of the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act

the sponsors of both the banking act of 1933 and the glass–steagall act of 1932 were southern democrats : senator carter glass of virginia ( who by 1932 had served in the house or the senate , or as the secretary of the treasury for the preceding 30 years ) ; and representative henry b between 1930 and 1932 , senator carter glass ( d-va ) introduced several versions of a bill ( known in each version as the glass bill ) to regulate or prohibit the combination of commercial and investment banking and to establish other reforms ( except deposit insurance ) similar to the final provisions of the 1933 banking act glass originally introduced his banking reform bill in january 1932 the senate passed a version of the glass bill that would have required commercial banks to eliminate their securities affiliates the final glass–steagall provisions contained in the 1933 banking act reduced from five years to one year the period in which commercial banks were required to eliminate such affiliations steagall insisted on protecting small banks while glass felt that small banks were the weakness to u.s many accounts of the act identify the pecora commission as important in leading to the act , particularly its glass–steagall provisions , becoming law while supporters of the glass–steagall separation of commercial and investment banking cite the pecora investigation as supporting that separation , perino 2010 glass–steagall critics have argued that the evidence from the pecora investigation did not support the separation of commercial and investment banking the previous glass bills before the final revision all had similar goals and brought up the same objectives , which were to separate commercial from investment banking , bring more banking activities under federal reserve supervision , and to allow branch banking in may 1933 , steagall 's addition of allowing state-chartered banks to receive federal deposit insurance and shortening the time in which banks needed to eliminate securities affiliates to one year was known as the driving force of what helped the glass–steagall act to be signed into law the glass–steagall separation of commercial and investment banking was in four sections of the 1933 banking act ( sections 16 , 20 , 21 , and 32 ) aside from the section 21 prohibition on securities firms taking deposits , neither savings and loans nor state-chartered banks that did not belong to the federal reserve system were restricted by glass–steagall s & ls and securities firms took advantage of these loopholes starting in the 1960s to create products and affiliated companies that chipped away at commercial banks ' deposit and lending businesses while permitting affiliations between securities firms and companies other than federal reserve member banks , glass–steagall distinguished between what a federal reserve member bank could do directly and what an affiliate could do although most of these interpretations were overturned by court decisions , by the late 1970s bank regulators began issuing glass–steagall interpretations that were upheld by courts and that permitted banks and their affiliates to engage in an increasing variety of securities activities vandenberg commodity futures modernization act of 2000 corporate law decline of the glass–steagall act subprime mortgage crisis systemic risk

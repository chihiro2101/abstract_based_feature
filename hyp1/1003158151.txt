toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch ed summers , a pittsburgh teammate of cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it , modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance created by the act of throwing a ball , the ball 's trajectory is significantly affected by variations in airflow caused by differences between the smooth surface of the ball and the stitching of its seams the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter ; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic according to physicist robert adair , due to the physiological limitation of human reaction time , a breaking knuckleball may be impossible to hit except by luck ( a common phrase for hitting a knuckleball is '' if it 's low , let it go ; if it 's high , let it fly '' ; meaning that a batter should attempt to hit a knuckleball only if it crosses the plate high in the strike zone due to lack of break to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight however , since a typical major league starting rotation exceeds the length of a series against any one opponent , one way a manager can mitigate this disadvantage is to adjust his team 's pitching rotation so as to eliminate ( or at least minimize ) games in which a knuckleballer would pitch against teams with a preponderance of fast baserunners image : wakefield throws a knuckleball.jpg thumb right 267px tim wakefield in his throwing motion , showing his grip of the knuckleball since it developed during a period when the spitball was legal and commonly used , and was similarly surprising in its motion , the knuckleball was sometimes called the '' dry spitter '' cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a '' shine ball '' ( because he would '' shine '' one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform ) however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball two later pitchers , jesse haines and freddie fitzsimmons , were sometimes characterized as knuckleball pitchers even by their contemporaries , but in their cases it again refers to a harder-thrown , curving pitch that would probably not be called a knuckleball today many current pitchers throw a curveball using a grip with the index finger touching the ball with the knuckle or fingertip ( also called a spike curve ) , only about 70 major league baseball pitchers have regularly used the knuckleball during their careers , and its use has become rarer over time '' former knuckleballer and pitching coach charlie hough says that the increased rarity of the knuckleball is due to scouts increasingly looking only for the best arm this effect is increasing over time as the modern game continues to emphasize power in pitching and average pitch speed increases additionally , ted lyons , another member of the hall of fame , relied heavily on the knuckleball after injuring his arm in 1931 the knuckleball is radically different from any other pitch in a pitcher 's arsenal , being less predictable and difficult to control unlike conventional pitches , which perform fast results without much exertion , a knuckleball pitcher must train his body and muscle memory to be able to execute a 65 & nbsp ; mph pitch with less than one rotation as with hitters , the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle , and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls however , the seam on a cricket ball is equatorial , and thus the extent of erratic movement is reduced due to the symmetry ( at least in the conventional release position where the planes of the ball 's trajectory and the seam are nearly co-planar ) in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch

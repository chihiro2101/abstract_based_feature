toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance created by the act of throwing a ball , the ball 's trajectory is significantly affected by variations in airflow caused by differences between the smooth surface of the ball and the stitching of its seams over the distance from the pitcher 's mound to home plate , the effect of these forces is that the knuckleball can flutter , dance , jiggle , or curve in two different directions during its flight the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter ; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic even a ball thrown without rotation will '' flutter '' , due to the '' apparent wind '' it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a '' shine ball '' ( because he would '' shine '' one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform ) however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball the knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it ( also with the knuckles or fingernails ) , but it is generally thrown harder and with spin toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve two later pitchers , jesse haines and freddie fitzsimmons , were sometimes characterized as knuckleball pitchers even by their contemporaries , but in their cases it again refers to a harder-thrown , curving pitch that would probably not be called a knuckleball today many current pitchers throw a curveball using a grip with the index finger touching the ball with the knuckle or fingertip ( also called a spike curve ) '' former knuckleballer and pitching coach charlie hough says that the increased rarity of the knuckleball is due to scouts increasingly looking only for the best arm hoyt wilhelm , phil niekro , and jesse haines , three pitchers who primarily relied on the knuckleball , have been inducted into the baseball hall of fame another factor contributing to the rarity of the knuckleball is the difficulty of throwing the pitch because there are so few knuckleball pitchers , the resources for learning and improving the knuckleball are few compared to more common pitches '' in 1991 , hall of fame catcher rick ferrell was quoted as saying , '' i think the knuckleball is fading out as with hitters , the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle , and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls in baseball terminology the pitcher and catcher together are known as a '' battery '' , and having a catcher experienced in catching a knuckleball pitcher is preferable , so the trade of pitcher and catcher together is sometimes referred to as a '' batteries included '' trade it was tied by geno petralli of the texas rangers in 1987 while trying to catch knuckleball pitcher charlie hough , and tied again in 2013 when ryan lavarnway of the boston red sox had four in the first inning , catching knuckleballer steven wright in wright 's first major league start in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch

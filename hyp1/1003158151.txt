toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch this grip can also include digging the fingernails into the surface of the ball the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a however , young pitchers with smaller hands tend to throw the knuckleball with their knuckles sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance regardless of how the ball is gripped , the purpose of the knuckleball is to have the least possible amount of rotational spin created by the act of throwing a ball , the ball 's trajectory is significantly affected by variations in airflow caused by differences between the smooth surface of the ball and the stitching of its seams a pitch thrown completely without spin is less desirable , however , than one with a very slight spin the ball completes between one-quarter and one-half a rotation on its way from the pitcher to the batter ; the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic even a ball thrown without rotation will '' flutter '' , due to the '' apparent wind '' it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path if a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight , however , then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed ( a common phrase for hitting a knuckleball is '' if it 's low , let it go ; if it 's high , let it fly '' ; meaning that a batter should attempt to hit a knuckleball only if it crosses the plate high in the strike zone due to lack of break to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a '' shine ball '' ( because he would '' shine '' one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform ) these include the flutterball , the floater , the dancer , the butterfly ball ( the name for the pitch used by french language game commentators employed by the montreal expos ) , the ghostball , and the bug the knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it ( also with the knuckles or fingernails ) , but it is generally thrown harder and with spin toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve because the speed of any prospect 's pitch is one of the quickest and easiest metrics in judging the skill of the prospect , the knuckleball , which is thrown slower than any other pitch , gets overlooked it is for this reason that the knuckleball is widely regarded as unreliable , and knuckleball pitchers are prone to extended slumps , such as when tim wakefield was released from the pirates in a mid-career slump during spring training in 1995 it is almost never used in a mixed repertoire today , however , and some believe that to throw the knuckleball effectively with some semblance of control over the pitch , one must throw it more or less exclusively knuckleball pitchers can throw more innings than other pitchers , and , requiring less time to recover after pitching , can pitch more frequently as with hitters , the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle , and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch

toad ramsey of the louisville colonels in the old american association—his pitch likely resembled the knuckle curve—and eddie cicotte of the chicago white sox , who in 1908 was nicknamed '' knuckles '' , are two possible creators of the pitch image : eddiecicotte55.jpg right thumb 167px eddie cicotte , who is sometimes credited with inventing the knuckleball as used by cicotte , the knuckleball was originally thrown by holding the ball with the knuckles , hence the name of the pitch ed summers , a pittsburgh teammate of cicotte who adopted the pitch and helped develop it , modified it by holding the ball with his fingertips and using the thumb for balance the fingertip grip is more commonly used today by knuckleball pitchers , like retired boston red sox pitcher tim wakefield , who had a knuckleball with a lot of movement there are other prominent knuckleball pitchers like hall of famer phil niekro , who had a very effective knuckler and knuckle curve , and cy young award winning pitcher r.a however , young pitchers with smaller hands tend to throw the knuckleball with their knuckles sometimes young players will throw the knuckleball with their knuckles flat against the ball , giving it less spin but also making it difficult to throw any significant distance even a ball thrown without rotation will '' flutter '' , due to the '' apparent wind '' it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path hitting a knuckleball is different enough from other aspects of baseball that players specifically prepare for the pitch during batting practice before games they expect it in if a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight , however , then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases however , since a typical major league starting rotation exceeds the length of a series against any one opponent , one way a manager can mitigate this disadvantage is to adjust his team 's pitching rotation so as to eliminate ( or at least minimize ) games in which a knuckleballer would pitch against teams with a preponderance of fast baserunners image : wakefield throws a knuckleball.jpg thumb right 267px tim wakefield in his throwing motion , showing his grip of the knuckleball since it developed during a period when the spitball was legal and commonly used , and was similarly surprising in its motion , the knuckleball was sometimes called the '' dry spitter '' cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a '' shine ball '' ( because he would '' shine '' one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform ) however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball the knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it ( also with the knuckles or fingernails ) , but it is generally thrown harder and with spin toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve two later pitchers , jesse haines and freddie fitzsimmons , were sometimes characterized as knuckleball pitchers even by their contemporaries , but in their cases it again refers to a harder-thrown , curving pitch that would probably not be called a knuckleball today many current pitchers throw a curveball using a grip with the index finger touching the ball with the knuckle or fingertip ( also called a spike curve ) , only about 70 major league baseball pitchers have regularly used the knuckleball during their careers , and its use has become rarer over time hoyt wilhelm , phil niekro , and jesse haines , three pitchers who primarily relied on the knuckleball , have been inducted into the baseball hall of fame dickey became the first cy young award-winning knuckleball pitcher , he called the award '' a victory for … the knuckleball fraternity '' , and of the dozens of phone calls he received after the announcement , niekro 's was the only one he answered former catcher bob uecker , who caught for phil niekro , said , '' the way to catch a knuckleball is to wait until it stops rolling and pick it up the '' knuckleball catcher '' is equipped with an oversized knuckleball catcher 's mitt , similar to a first baseman 's glove ;

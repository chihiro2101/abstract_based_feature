the position of the stitches changes as the ball travels , affecting the drag that gives the ball its motion , thus making its flight erratic even a ball thrown without rotation will '' flutter '' , due to the '' apparent wind '' it feels as its trajectory changes throughout its flight path according to physicist robert adair , due to the physiological limitation of human reaction time , a breaking knuckleball may be impossible to hit except by luck if a knuckleball does not change direction in mid-flight , however , then it is easy to hit due to its lack of speed to reduce the chances of having the knuckleball get hit for a home run , some pitchers will impart a slight topspin so that if no force causes the ball to dance , it will move downward in flight this is due to both the knuckleball 's low average speed and its erratic movement , which force the catcher to keep focusing on the ball even after the runners start stealing their next bases however , since a typical major league starting rotation exceeds the length of a series against any one opponent , one way a manager can mitigate this disadvantage is to adjust his team 's pitching rotation so as to eliminate ( or at least minimize ) games in which a knuckleballer would pitch against teams with a preponderance of fast baserunners cicotte was widely reported to throw both the knuckleball and a variant on the spitball known as a '' shine ball '' ( because he would '' shine '' one side of a dirty ball by rubbing it on his uniform ) however , cicotte called the shine ball '' a pure freak of the imagination '' , claiming that he did this to disconcert hitters and that the pitch was still a knuckleball these include the flutterball , the floater , the dancer , the butterfly ball ( the name for the pitch used by french language game commentators employed by the montreal expos ) , the ghostball , and the bug the knuckle curve has a somewhat similar name because of the grip used to throw it ( also with the knuckles or fingernails ) , but it is generally thrown harder and with spin toad ramsey , a pitcher from 1885 to 1890 , is credited in some later sources with being the first knuckleballer , apparently based primarily on accounts of how he gripped the ball ; however , based on more contemporary descriptions of his pitch as an '' immense drop ball '' , it may be that his pitch was a form of knuckle curve , only about 70 major league baseball pitchers have regularly used the knuckleball during their careers , and its use has become rarer over time hoyt wilhelm , phil niekro , and jesse haines , three pitchers who primarily relied on the knuckleball , have been inducted into the baseball hall of fame in november 2008 , it was announced that 16-year-old knuckleballer eri yoshida was drafted as the first woman ever to play in japanese professional baseball for the kobe 9 cruise of the kansai independent baseball league as with hitters , the unpredictable motion of the knuckleball makes it one of the most difficult pitches for catchers to handle , and they tend to be charged with a significantly higher number of passed balls on occasion , teams have traded knuckleball pitchers and their catchers in the same transaction in baseball terminology the pitcher and catcher together are known as a '' battery '' , and having a catcher experienced in catching a knuckleball pitcher is preferable , so the trade of pitcher and catcher together is sometimes referred to as a '' batteries included '' trade in association football or soccer , the method of striking the ball so that it produces almost no spinning motion during its flight has been colloquially described as '' knuckleballing '' by commentators , due to the ball 's motion that resembles a baseball thrown with a knuckleball pitch

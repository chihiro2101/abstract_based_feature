benoît said that it was wrong to assume tocqueville was a supporter of bugeaud despite his 1841 apologetic discourse it seems that tocqueville modified his views after his second visit to algeria in 1846 as he criticized bugeaud 's desire to invade kabylie in an 1847 speech to the assembly although tocqueville had favoured retention of distinct traditional law , administrators , schools and so on for arabs who had come under french control , he judged the berber tribes of kabylie ( in his second of two letters on algeria , 1837 ) as '' savages '' not suited for this arrangement because he argued they would best be managed not by force of arms , but by the pacifying influences of commerce and cultural interaction although in his 1841 report on algeria he applauded bugeaud for making war in a way that defeated abd-el-kader 's resistance , he had advocated in the two letters that the french military advance leave kabylie undisturbed and in subsequent speeches and writings he continued to oppose intrusion into kabylie in the debate about the 1846 extraordinary funds , tocqueville denounced bugeaud 's conduct of military operations and succeeded in convincing the assembly not to vote funds in support of bugeaud 's military columns tocqueville considered bugeaud 's plan to invade kabylie despite the opposition of the assembly as a seditious act in the face of which the government was opting for cowardice in his 1847 '' report on algeria '' , tocqueville declared that europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the european colonization of the americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences in the case of algeria , the port of algiers and the control over the strait of gibraltar were considered by tocqueville to be particularly valuable whereas direct control of the political operations of the entirety of algeria was not thus , the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas such laws are not discussed in detail , but given that the goal of the french mission in algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense , it can be deduced that tocqueville would not concur with just war theory 's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause v , 1 of the of tocqueville

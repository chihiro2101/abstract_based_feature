portuguese and dutch sailors called them the cape clouds , a name that was retained for several centuries between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds in 1908 , the results of her study were published , which showed that a type of variable star called a '' cluster variable '' , later called a cepheid variable after the prototype star delta cephei , showed a definite relationship between the variability period and the star 's apparent brightness leavitt reaized that since all the stars in the smc are roughly the same distance from earth , this result implied that there is similar relationship between period and absolute brightness this important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the smc using this period-luminosity relation , in 1913 the distance to the smc was first estimated by ejnar hertzsprung announced in 2006 , measurements with the hubble space telescope suggest the large and small magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies the small magellanic cloud contains a large and active population of x-ray binary uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602

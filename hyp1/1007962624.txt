in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians during the circumnavigation of the earth by ferdinand magellan in 1519 & ndash ; 22 , they were described by antonio pigafetta as dim clusters of stars between 1893 and 1906 , under the direction of solon bailey , the telescope at this site was used to survey photographically both the large and small magellanic clouds announced in 2006 , measurements with the hubble space telescope suggest the large and small magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way in 2017 , using dark energy survey plus maglites data , a stellar over-density associated with the small magellanic cloud was discovered , which is probably the result of interactions between smc and lmc the small magellanic cloud contains a large and active population of x-ray binary recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass x-ray binaries ( hmxbs ) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function the smc was detected with an x-ray luminosity of 5 ergs/s in the range 1.5–12 kev , and 2.5 ergs/s in the range 5–50 kev for an apparently extended source uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602 nasa extragalactic database entry on the smc seds entry on the smc smc at esa/hubble astronomy picture of the day 2010 january 7 the tail of the small magellanic cloud - likely stripped from the galaxy by gravitational tides , the tail contains mostly gas , dust , and newly formed stars

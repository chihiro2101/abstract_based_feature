in the southern hemisphere , the magellanic clouds have long been included in the lore of native inhabitants , including south sea islanders and indigenous australians in johann bayer 's celestial atlas uranometria , published in 1603 , he named the smaller cloud , nubecula minor this important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the smc by comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by leavitt , he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs ( 30,000 light years ) between the sun and the smc announced in 2006 , measurements with the hubble space telescope suggest the large and small magellanic clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the milky way there is a bridge of gas connecting the small magellanic cloud with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies most hmxbs are of the be type which account for 70 % in the milky way and 98 % in the smc uhuru observed the smc on january 1 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 , 1971 , and detected one source located at 01149-7342 , which was then designated smc x-1 the third ariel 5 catalog ( 3a ) also contains this early x-ray source within tucana : 3a 0116-736 ( 2a 0116-737 , smc x-1 ) two additional sources detected and listed in 3a include smc x-2 at 3a 0042-738 and smc x-3 at 3a 0049-726 small magellanic cloud in fiction large magellanic cloud magellanic clouds objects within the small magellanic cloud : ngc 265 ngc 290 ngc 346 ngc 602

political reaction resulting from the great irish famine was muted , because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time the 1848 young ireland rebellion under thomas davis , though occurring at the start of the famine , was hardly impacted upon by the famine , as much as by the clash between the '' constitutional '' nationalism and catholicism of o'connell and the pluralist republicanism of davis historians have speculated that , such was the economic and social impact on ireland , the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards ; in other words , that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s the home rule league was reconstituted as the irish parliamentary party , under charles stewart parnell in the 1880s ; parnell was also instrumental in establishing the irish land league , to achieve land reform a large body of voters continued to vote for unionists , who wished to maintain the union that joined britain and ireland although some believed the myth that queen victoria ( known in ireland in later decades as the '' famine queen '' ) had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief , in fact the sum was £2,000 , the equivalent of £61,000 today , from her personal resources the celebrations associated with her visit just after the famine were compared to '' illuminating a graveyard '' in a newspaper editorial at the time kinealy , christine ( 2000 ) , hidden famine : hunger , poverty and sectarianism in belfast , p 184 an additional social impact due to the high numbers of children orphaned was that for some young women , prostitution was one of few options available it is estimated that one and a half million people died during the famine and that a million emigrated between 1846 and 1851 the famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language ( the general exclusion of irish from public life and the influence of the english-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part ) but it was a conspicuous element the latter persisted in the form of irish language manuscripts containing both prose and poetry : a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature the emigration of numerous irish speakers to america as an immediate or long-term result of the famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the irish language if the political elite in ireland remained tolerant of british political parties and the monarchy , emigrants were not so a claim was made by a us professor of law , francis boyle that the famine was genocide by the english against the irish , meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination donnelly , jr , as well as historians cecil woodham-smith , peter gray , ruth dudley edwards , and cormac ó gráda have denied claims of a deliberate policy of genocide all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different debated greatly , there are public records that there was enough grain and meal in ireland during that period to have prevented the food shortage caused by the potato blight whether the british empire made a conscious decision to allow 1 million irish people to die , or whether the government was negligent , are issues in the debate over whether that episode of irish history was due primarily to famine or genocide ireland commemorated the 150th anniversary of the great famine in the 1990s beyond these important cultural aspects , emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of irish political life in the 1940s , and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims , who had died or emigrated the 1990s marked a significant shift in attitudes towards commemorating the famine , as hundreds of events took place in ireland and throughout the irish diaspora , some of which received sponsorship from the national famine commemoration committee based in the department of the taoiseach , led by td avril doyle at the great famine event held in millstreet , a statement from british prime minister tony blair was read aloud , apologising for the failure of past british governments to adequately address the crisis the famine is also commemorated in song , both from the period and from modern times irish novelist and songwriter , brendan graham has written a number of novels and songs on an gorta mór – the great irish famine the sunday times , canberra called the whitest flower – 'an important addition to the irish national story ' moore quinn in her book 'irish american folklore in new england ' , published in 2009 , quotes the full lyric of the voice '' the fairhaired boy '' – this song written by brendan graham was recorded by cathy jordan and dervish on their 2003 album , 'spirit ' fourteen irish composers were asked to pick a monument of national significance and to write a piece of music/song which would release from it the music frozen within the irish famine experience continues to influence many irish people in their attitudes towards the developing world and famine victims everywhere

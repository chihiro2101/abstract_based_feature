political reaction resulting from the great irish famine was muted , because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time irish politics in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the catholic emancipation and '' repeal '' movements under daniel o'connell ( the independent irish party , formed in june 1852 , disintegrated within four years , but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices the 1848 young ireland rebellion under thomas davis , though occurring at the start of the famine , was hardly impacted upon by the famine , as much as by the clash between the '' constitutional '' nationalism and catholicism of o'connell and the pluralist republicanism of davis historians have speculated that , such was the economic and social impact on ireland , the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards ; in other words , that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s though its electorate was a small part of the population ( as elsewhere in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) , those irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major british political parties , the conservatives and the liberals , with more votes and seats going to the latter , even though it had been the party of government during the famine the introduction of the secret ballot in 1872 enabled the home rule league to largely replace the liberals in irish politics in 1874 the home rule league was reconstituted as the irish parliamentary party , under charles stewart parnell in the 1880s ; parnell was also instrumental in establishing the irish land league , to achieve land reform on instruction of the lord lieutenant of ireland victoria made what was largely seen as a propaganda visit in 1849 the famine was not the only reason for the decline of the language ( the general exclusion of irish from public life and the influence of the english-speaking clergy and middle classes also played a part ) but it was a conspicuous element in pre-famine ireland irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition the latter persisted in the form of irish language manuscripts containing both prose and poetry : a single collection would give the reader access to a substantial part of the literature the emigration of numerous irish speakers to america as an immediate or long-term result of the famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the irish language if the political elite in ireland remained tolerant of british political parties and the monarchy , emigrants were not so many irish emigrants to the united states quickly associated with separatist republican groups and organisations like the irb analysing the famine , he wrote : mitchel 's commentary expressed the anger felt by many emigrants , who saw themselves as the dispossessed , forced from ireland by a famine they blamed on british government policies the famine became a constant issue with irish americans , who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the united states , remained emotionally attached to their native land leaders such as john devoy in later decades came to play a major role in supporting irish independence it was no accident that the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera in 1920 chose to travel to the united states , not elsewhere , in his efforts to get the irish republic recognised and accepted , or that when michael collins launched special bonds to fund the new republic , many were sold to irish americans a claim was made by a us professor of law , francis boyle that the famine was genocide by the english against the irish , meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different at the great famine event held in millstreet , a statement from british prime minister tony blair was read aloud , apologising for the failure of past british governments to adequately address the crisis '' crucán na bpáiste '' – 'the burial place of ( unbaptised ) children ' – lies on a hilltop in maamtrasna , co.mayo , overlooking lough nafooey , and lough mask in ireland the song was written by graham for ellen rua , one of the characters in his second novel , the brightest day , the darkest night , also published by harper collins graham chose the curvilinear glasshouses at dublin 's national botanic gardens , constructed at the time of an gorta mór , by monies diverted from research to find a cure for the potato blight afflicting ireland a song for unaccompanied voice it has been recorded by róisín elsafty , on the ceól reoite album and as a 'hidden track ' by cathy jordan on the dervish album , spirit in quebec , 2011 , his shorter narrative and song piece – from famine to freedom – ireland to grosse ile – was performed by the quebec symphony orchestra and soloist méav ní mhaolchatha , with graham 's narration translated into french luka bloom 's song 'forgiveness ' from his album salty heaven is sung from the point of view of an irish famine refugee who has relocated to canada and who despite his suffering has chosen forgiveness over bitterness luka bloom 's brother christy moore also has a song , written by bloom but recorded by moore , called 'the city of chicago , ' that chronicles the effects of the famine and the subsequent mass emigration another related song is '' famine '' by sinéad o'connor , released on the universal mother album

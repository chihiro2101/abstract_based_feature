political reaction resulting from the great irish famine was muted , because of the extremely limited electoral franchise that existed at the time irish politics in the 1820s to 1840s had been dominated by the catholic emancipation and '' repeal '' movements under daniel o'connell ( the independent irish party , formed in june 1852 , disintegrated within four years , but it was in major decline from 1853 when tenants benefited from a recovery in agricultural prices the 1848 young ireland rebellion under thomas davis , though occurring at the start of the famine , was hardly impacted upon by the famine , as much as by the clash between the '' constitutional '' nationalism and catholicism of o'connell and the pluralist republicanism of davis historians have speculated that , such was the economic and social impact on ireland , the nation was numbed into inaction for decades afterwards ; in other words , that politics mattered less to people than survival after the traumatic experiences of the late 1840s and early 1850s though its electorate was a small part of the population ( as elsewhere in the united kingdom of great britain and ireland ) , those irish privileged to vote continued until the mid-1870s to vote for the two major british political parties , the conservatives and the liberals , with more votes and seats going to the latter , even though it had been the party of government during the famine the home rule league was reconstituted as the irish parliamentary party , under charles stewart parnell in the 1880s ; parnell was also instrumental in establishing the irish land league , to achieve land reform although some believed the myth that queen victoria ( known in ireland in later decades as the '' famine queen '' ) had only donated a miserly £5 to famine relief , in fact the sum was £2,000 , the equivalent of £61,000 today , from her personal resources kinealy , christine ( 2000 ) , hidden famine : hunger , poverty and sectarianism in belfast , p 184 an additional social impact due to the high numbers of children orphaned was that for some young women , prostitution was one of few options available ) ( 1969 ) , a view of the irish language , irish stationery office in pre-famine ireland irish was the language both of a rich folk culture and a strong literary tradition the emigration of numerous irish speakers to america as an immediate or long-term result of the famine led to a movement there for the maintenance of the irish language if the political elite in ireland remained tolerant of british political parties and the monarchy , emigrants were not so john mitchel , a journalist by trade ( who had written for thomas davis 's newspaper , the nation before leaving to set up his own paper , only to be arrested , tried for sedition and transported to the penal colony of van diemen 's land ) proved to be a superb campaigner against british rule in ireland the famine became a constant issue with irish americans , who to an extent unrivalled among other emigrant communities in the united states , remained emotionally attached to their native land a claim was made by a us professor of law , francis boyle that the famine was genocide by the english against the irish , meaning that the famine was part of a deliberate policy of planned extermination all historians generally agree that british policies during the famine ( particularly those applied by the ministry of lord john russell ) were misguided , ill-informed , and counter-productive , and that had a similar crisis occurred in england instead of ireland then the government 's response would have been very different debated greatly , there are public records that there was enough grain and meal in ireland during that period to have prevented the food shortage caused by the potato blight whether the british empire made a conscious decision to allow 1 million irish people to die , or whether the government was negligent , are issues in the debate over whether that episode of irish history was due primarily to famine or genocide beyond these important cultural aspects , emigration was a continuing and embarrassing fact of irish political life in the 1940s , and there was no natural constituency for the famine victims , who had died or emigrated the sunday times , canberra called the whitest flower – 'an important addition to the irish national story ' moore quinn in her book 'irish american folklore in new england ' , published in 2009 , quotes the full lyric of the voice in the whitest flower , graham 's heroine ellen sings the song to roberteen , a young neighbour from ireland whom she finds dying in the lazaretto ( fever shed ) at canada 's quarantine island of grosse ile the song is written in a traditional narrative style song form where there are no choruses , the hook of the song being contained in the last line of each stanza with the pull of the story being used to keep the listener 's interest alive the song was written by graham for ellen rua , one of the characters in his second novel , the brightest day , the darkest night , also published by harper collins in response to the view handed down at the time of ireland 's famine that '' the judgement of god…sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated '' ( charles e in 1985 bob geldof , irish rock star and founder of live aid , revealed that the people of ireland had given more to his fundraising efforts per head of population than any other nation in the world the irish famine experience continues to influence many irish people in their attitudes towards the developing world and famine victims everywhere gratitude to the ottomans 'queen victoria 's £5 ' : the strange tale of turkish aid to ireland during the great famine

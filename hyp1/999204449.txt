alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original sheepdog of shetland was a spitz-type dog , probably similar to the modern icelandic sheepdog the original spitz-type working sheepdog of shetland is now extinct , having been replaced for herding there by the border collie shelties were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them shetland collies , which upset rough collie breeders , so the name was changed to shetland sheepdog the year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the sheltie by the english kennel club , with the first registered sheltie being a female called badenock rose the first sheltie to be registered by the american kennel club was '' lord scott '' in 1911 the general appearance of the sheltie is that of a miniature rough collie they are a small , double coated , working dog , agile and sturdy blue merle shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye , but all others have dark-colored eyes they are an intensely loyal breed , sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the akc breed standard shelties have a double coat , which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat the english kennel club describes three different colors : '' tricolor , blue merle , and sable ( ranging from golden through mahogany ) , marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan in the show ring , blue merles may have blue eyes ; all other colors must have brown eyes sable & nbsp ; – sable is dominant over other colors may be pure for sable ( two sable genes ) or may be tri-factored or bi-factored ( carrying one sable gene and one tricolor or bicolor gene ) a bi-black sheltie carries two bi-black genes ; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is sable merle—faded or mottled sable and white sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables ; therefore , blue eyes are a major fault in akc white factoring affects the amount of white on the dog there have been reports of a brindle sheltie but many sheltie enthusiasts agree that a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific sheltie could have produced a brindle colors may not be faded , no conspicuous white spots , and the color can not be over 50 percent white shelties have a double coat , and often shed a lot of the time , no matter the season the coat is usually shed twice a year , often in spring and autumn stanley coren , an expert on animal intelligence , the shetland sheepdog is one of the brightest dogs , ranking 6th out of 138 breeds tested although small breed dogs do not usually suffer unduly from hip dysplasia , it has been identified in shelties a cea score considered too high to breed with may still be low enough not to affect the dog 's life mating a sable and white to a blue merle can produce a sable merle , which is undesirable for the show ring in their size group , the breed dominates dog agility , obedience , showmanship , flyball , tracking , and herding

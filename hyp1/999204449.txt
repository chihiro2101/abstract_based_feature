alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original sheepdog of shetland was a spitz-type dog , probably similar to the modern icelandic sheepdog shelties were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them shetland collies , which upset rough collie breeders , so the name was changed to shetland sheepdog blue merle shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye , but all others have dark-colored eyes shelties have a double coat , which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat the english kennel club describes three different colors : '' tricolor , blue merle , and sable ( ranging from golden through mahogany ) , marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan '' essentially , however , a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog , either black , white , and tan ( tricolor ) in the show ring , blue merles may have blue eyes ; all other colors must have brown eyes sable & nbsp ; – sable is dominant over other colors may be pure for sable ( two sable genes ) or may be tri-factored or bi-factored ( carrying one sable gene and one tricolor or bicolor gene ) a shaded dog ( one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat ) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored a bi-black sheltie carries two bi-black genes ; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is any of the above colors may also have a color modification gene merling dilutes the base color ( sable , tricolor , or bi-black ) causing a black dog 's coat to show a mix of black , white , and grey hairs , often with black patches may have blue eyes sable merle—faded or mottled sable and white often born with a mottled coat of darker brown over lighter brown , they usually present as a faded or lighter sable or can appear as a washed-out blue-merle breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites — shelties with colored heads ( sable , tricolor , bi-black , or blue or sable merle ) and white bodies for show dogs , dogs more than 50 percent white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring ; they are normal in every other way double merles , a product of breeding two merle shelties together , have a very high incidence of deafness or blindness unacceptable colors in the show ring are a rustiness in a blue or black coat colors may not be faded , no conspicuous white spots , and the color can not be over 50 percent white wide-set ( too much distance between ) ears are also not a desired trait , nor are ears which tip too low down ( referred to as 'hound ' ears ) cea is genetic , inheritance is autosomal recessive , this means that even a dog that shows no phenotypic signs of the condition may be a carrier a cea score considered too high to breed with may still be low enough not to affect the dog 's life like cea , an affected dog should not be bred with but these dogs can live happily as pets both male and female should be tested for thyroid problems , von willebrands disease and brucellosis , as well as have hip x-rays and eyes cleared by the relevant national authorities a tri-colour to a pure-for-sable ( a sable and white which can produce only other sable and whites ) , will produce only sable and whites , but they will be tri-factored sable and whites ( which means they have the tri-gene

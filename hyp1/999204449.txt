alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original sheepdog of shetland was a spitz-type dog , probably similar to the modern icelandic sheepdog this dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands , and then after being brought to england , it was further extensively crossed with the rough collie , and other breeds including some or all of the extinct greenland dog , the king charles spaniel ( not the cavalier ) , the pomeranian , and possibly the border collie the original spitz-type working sheepdog of shetland is now extinct , having been replaced for herding there by the border collie when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them shetland collies , which upset rough collie breeders , so the name was changed to shetland sheepdog during the early 20th century ( up until the 1940s ) , additional crosses were made to rough collies to help retain the desired rough collie type – in fact , the first akc sheltie champion 's dam was a purebred rough collie the year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the sheltie by the english kennel club , with the first registered sheltie being a female called badenock rose blue merle shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye , but all others have dark-colored eyes they are an intensely loyal breed , sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the akc breed standard the english kennel club describes three different colors : '' tricolor , blue merle , and sable ( ranging from golden through mahogany ) , marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan '' essentially , however , a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog , either black , white , and tan ( tricolor ) in the show ring , blue merles may have blue eyes ; all other colors must have brown eyes may be pure for sable ( two sable genes ) or may be tri-factored or bi-factored ( carrying one sable gene and one tricolor or bicolor gene ) a shaded dog ( one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat ) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored a bi-black sheltie carries two bi-black genes ; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is merling dilutes the base color ( sable , tricolor , or bi-black ) causing a black dog 's coat to show a mix of black , white , and grey hairs , often with black patches sable merle—faded or mottled sable and white sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables ; therefore , blue eyes are a major fault in akc double merles , a product of breeding two merle shelties together , have a very high incidence of deafness or blindness there have been reports of a brindle sheltie but many sheltie enthusiasts agree that a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific sheltie could have produced a brindle to conform to the breed standards , the shelties ' ears should bend slightly or '' tip '' , this contributes to the '' proper sheltie expression '' if a dog 's ears are not bent ( referred to as prick ears ) some owners brace them into the correct position for several weeks to several months shelties have a double coat , and often shed a lot of the time , no matter the season collie eye anomaly : an autosomal recessive inherited trait which results in incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure ; seen almost exclusively in collies , border collies and shetland sheepdogs signs of cea in shelties are small , or deepset eyes in most breeds it is also an autosomal recessive condition , however it has been found in other breeds to be autosomal dominant and sex-linked in others according to the college of veterinary medicine at washington state university , the shetland sheepdog , and many other herding breeds , have a risk of being born with a mdr1 gene mutation , with about 15 percent of individuals affected as the name suggests , shelties can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day in their size group , the breed dominates dog agility , obedience , showmanship , flyball , tracking , and herding

alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original sheepdog of shetland was a spitz-type dog , probably similar to the modern icelandic sheepdog the original spitz-type working sheepdog of shetland is now extinct , having been replaced for herding there by the border collie when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them shetland collies , which upset rough collie breeders , so the name was changed to shetland sheepdog the year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the sheltie by the english kennel club , with the first registered sheltie being a female called badenock rose the general appearance of the sheltie is that of a miniature rough collie blue merle shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye , but all others have dark-colored eyes shelties have a double coat , which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat in the show ring , blue merles may have blue eyes ; all other colors must have brown eyes '' tri-factored '' sable and '' shaded '' sable are not interchangeable terms a shaded dog ( one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat ) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored tricolor & nbsp ; – black , white , and tan bi-black & nbsp ; – black and white a bi-black sheltie carries two bi-black genes ; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is merling dilutes the base color ( sable , tricolor , or bi-black ) causing a black dog 's coat to show a mix of black , white , and grey hairs , often with black patches sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables ; therefore , blue eyes are a major fault in akc white factoring affects the amount of white on the dog for show dogs , dogs more than 50 percent white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring ; they are normal in every other way unacceptable colors in the show ring are a rustiness in a blue or black coat colors may not be faded , no conspicuous white spots , and the color can not be over 50 percent white accepted height ranges may differ depending on country and standard used to conform to the breed standards , the shelties ' ears should bend slightly or '' tip '' , this contributes to the '' proper sheltie expression '' wide-set ( too much distance between ) ears are also not a desired trait , nor are ears which tip too low down ( referred to as 'hound ' ears ) shelties have a double coat , and often shed a lot of the time , no matter the season male shelties technically shed less than females but fur still comes off constantly breeders should actively try to breed this disease out by only breeding with dogs that have '' clear '' eyes or very low scoring eyes as the name suggests , shelties can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day in their size group , the breed dominates dog agility , obedience , showmanship , flyball , tracking , and herding badenock rose - the first shetland sheepdog registered with the the kennel club

alt unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts , this breed was not developed simply by selective breeding the rough collie for smaller and smaller size the original sheepdog of shetland was a spitz-type dog , probably similar to the modern icelandic sheepdog the original spitz-type working sheepdog of shetland is now extinct , having been replaced for herding there by the border collie shelties were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds when the breed was originally introduced breeders called them shetland collies , which upset rough collie breeders , so the name was changed to shetland sheepdog the year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the sheltie by the english kennel club , with the first registered sheltie being a female called badenock rose the first sheltie to be registered by the american kennel club was '' lord scott '' in 1911 the general appearance of the sheltie is that of a miniature rough collie they are a small , double coated , working dog , agile and sturdy blue merle shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye , but all others have dark-colored eyes they are an intensely loyal breed , sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the akc breed standard '' essentially , however , a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog , either black , white , and tan ( tricolor ) in the show ring , blue merles may have blue eyes ; all other colors must have brown eyes a shaded dog ( one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat ) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored a bi-black sheltie carries two bi-black genes ; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat color is sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables ; therefore , blue eyes are a major fault in akc double merles , a product of breeding two merle shelties together , have a very high incidence of deafness or blindness wide-set ( too much distance between ) ears are also not a desired trait , nor are ears which tip too low down ( referred to as 'hound ' ears ) shelties have a double coat , and often shed a lot of the time , no matter the season the down hair is short , furry and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm the coat is usually shed twice a year , often in spring and autumn like the rough collie , there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes many breeders will have their dogs ' hips x-rayed and certified by the orthopedic foundation for animals signs of cea in shelties are small , or deepset eyes pra can be detected at any time but usually does not show up until the dog is around two years old like cea , an affected dog should not be bred with but these dogs can live happily as pets as the name suggests , shelties can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day in their size group , the breed dominates dog agility , obedience , showmanship , flyball , tracking , and herding ch halstor 's peter pumpkin rom - the shetland sheepdog sire with the most champions ( 160 )

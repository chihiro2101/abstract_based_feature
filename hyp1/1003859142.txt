the ucc achieved the goal of substantial uniformity in commercial laws and , at the same time , allowed the states the flexibility to meet local circumstances by modifying the ucc 's text as enacted in each state the ucc deals primarily with transactions involving personal property ( movable property ) and not real property ( immovable property ) it governs a '' battle of the forms '' as to whose boilerplate terms , those of the offeror or the offeree , will survive a commercial transaction where multiple forms with varying terms are exchanged if performance is accepted after the counteroffer , even without express acceptance , under 2-207 ( 3 ) , a contract will exist under only those terms on which the parties agree , together with ucc gap-fillers the ownership of securities is governed by article 8 of the uniform commercial code ( ucc ) in this centralised system , the title transfer of the securities does not take place at the time of the registration with the issuer 's registrar for the account of the investor , but within the systems managed by dtc or by the federal reserve this decomposition of the rights organized by article 8 of the ucc results in preventing the investor to revindicate the security in case of bankruptcy of the account provider , that is to say the possibility to claim the security as its own asset , without being obliged to share it at its prorate value with the other creditors of the account provider this re-characterization of the proprietary right into a simple contractual right may enable the account provider to '' re-use '' the security without having to ask for the authorization of the investor article 9 governs security interests in personal property as collateral to secure a debt article 9 , which established a unified framework for security interests in personal property , directly inspired the enactment of personal property security acts in every canadian province and territory except quebec from 1990 onwards this was followed by new zealand 's personal property securities act 1999 and the australian personal property securities act of 2009

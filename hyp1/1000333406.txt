an early description of this phenomenon was provided by thomas young in a lecture given to the royal society in 1800 : the lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately show the current is deflected towards the body ; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current the pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere , a.k.a a hundred years later , henri coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his coandă-1910 aircraft , which mounted an unusual engine he designed in 1934 coandă obtained a patent in france for a '' method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' the first official documents that explicitly mention the coandă effect were two 1936 patents by henri coandă 3,261,162 , lifting device coanda effect , usa this name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist theodore von kármán , who had with coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) the resultant forces from this low pressure tube end up balancing any perpendicular flow instability , which stabilises the jet in a straight line however , if a solid surface is placed close , and approximately parallel to the jet ( diagram 2 ) , then the entrainment ( and therefore removal ) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that can not be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the '' open '' side of the jet the forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows these coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion , depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface the coandă effect can be induced in any fluid , and is therefore equally effective in water as in air coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a free jet or a wall jet on the left image of the preceding section : '' the mechanism of coanda effect '' , the effect as described , in the terms of t young as '' the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle '' , represents a free jet emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings on the right image , the effect occurs along the curved wall as a wall jet the image here on the right represents a two dimensional wall jet between two parallel plane walls , where the '' obstacle '' is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice , so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall , but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air to compare experiment with a theoretical model , we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width h along a circular wall of radius r this pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises , and disappear at the point where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall , where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure ( and the transverse gradient becomes zero ) experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) a coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment : a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9° , followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer , subject to this positive longitudinal gradient however , if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5 , the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall ( until the wall ends – ; see diagram on the right ) woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of a free jet of width h , deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r , between a first contact a and separation at b , including a deflection angle θ moreover , in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form , giving the distribution of velocity along the circular wall let us note the pressure and the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure , and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in a and θ in b & nbsp ; 104 and both images are quite similar : coanda effect of a free jet is inertial , the same as coanda effect of a wall jet the surface pressure distribution as well as the reattachment distance have been duly measured in both cases , and two approximate theories have been developed for the mean pressure within the separation bubble , the position of reattachment and the increase in volume flow from the orifice : the agreement with experiment was satisfactory the coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on aircraft , where air moving over the wing can be '' bent down '' towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing this project utilized a particular symmetric nozzle to produce an effective modeling of the coandă effect , trancossi m the coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a coandă effect mixer while the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above ( if one could see the air flow ) , the cause is not really the coandă effect here , because it is a flow of water into air , there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid ( the air ) into the jet ( the stream of water ) the force on the vessel generated by a propeller is a function of the speed , volume and direction of the water jet leaving the propeller

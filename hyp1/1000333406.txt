an early description of this phenomenon was provided by thomas young in a lecture given to the royal society in 1800 : the lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle a hundred years later , henri coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his coandă-1910 aircraft , which mounted an unusual engine he designed the motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward , and coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces in 1934 coandă obtained a patent in france for a '' method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' the first official documents that explicitly mention the coandă effect were two 1936 patents by henri coandă '' device for deflecting a stream of elastic fluid projected into an elastic fluid ( 1936 ) a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) however , if a solid surface is placed close , and approximately parallel to the jet ( diagram 2 ) , then the entrainment ( and therefore removal ) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that can not be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the '' open '' side of the jet the pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface , and then to adhere to it ( diagram 3 ) coanda effect retrieved 17 november 2017 the jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ( diagram 4 ) , because each ( infinitesimally small ) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface retrieved 17 november 2017 if the surface is not too sharply curved , the jet can , under the right circumstances , adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface , and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction the forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows these coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion , depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a free jet or a wall jet on the left image of the preceding section : '' the mechanism of coanda effect '' , the effect as described , in the terms of t young as '' the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle '' , represents a free jet emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings the image here on the right represents a two dimensional wall jet between two parallel plane walls , where the '' obstacle '' is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice , so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall , but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air to compare experiment with a theoretical model , we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width h along a circular wall of radius r a wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall , say of infinite radius , or rather whose radius is the radius of the earth without separation because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall this pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises , and disappear at the point where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall , where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure ( and the transverse gradient becomes zero ) experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) however , if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5 , the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall ( until the wall ends – ; see diagram on the right ) this is '' a true coandă effect '' as the jet clings to the wall '' at a nearly constant pressure '' as in a conventional wall jet , vii , 3 , , 1954 of an inviscid flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall , where a singular point appears with an infinite slope of the surface pressure curve 8 , coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs , and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution : the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above , outside the nozzle an alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates other experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that coandă effect does not occur in a laminar flow , and the critical h/r ratios for small reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of a free jet of width h , deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r , between a first contact a and separation at b , including a deflection angle θ & nbsp ; 104 and both images are quite similar : coanda effect of a free jet is inertial , the same as coanda effect of a wall jet this project utilized a particular symmetric nozzle to produce an effective modeling of the coandă effect , trancossi m due to the slope , the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing , and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the coandă effect , the water flows through the screen to the penstocks leading the water to the turbines in fluidics , the coandă effect was used to build bistable multivibrators , where the working stream ( compressed air ) stuck to one curved wall or another and control beams could switch the stream between the walls the coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball , when a ship moves through water ) the coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet , causing it to follow the shape of the ship 's hull

mark the dimple which a slender stream of air makes on the surface of water bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately show the current is deflected towards the body ; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current the pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere , a.k.a direct a flame parallel over a liquid or submerge a candle almost to its wick and the liquid will be seen to rise slightly as the heat of the flame lessens the atmospheric press pressing on the water a hundred years later , henri coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his coandă-1910 aircraft , which mounted an unusual engine he designed the motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward , and coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces in 1934 coandă obtained a patent in france for a '' method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' the first official documents that explicitly mention the coandă effect were two 1936 patents by henri coandă a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) however , if a solid surface is placed close , and approximately parallel to the jet ( diagram 2 ) , then the entrainment ( and therefore removal ) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that can not be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the '' open '' side of the jet the pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface , and then to adhere to it ( diagram 3 ) coanda effect retrieved 17 november 2017 the jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ( diagram 4 ) , because each ( infinitesimally small ) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface the forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows these coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion , depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface the coandă effect can be induced in any fluid , and is therefore equally effective in water as in air early sources provide information , both theoretical and experimental , needed to derive by comparison a detailed explanation of the coandă effect and its limits coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a free jet or a wall jet on the left image of the preceding section : '' the mechanism of coanda effect '' , the effect as described , in the terms of t young as '' the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle '' , represents a free jet emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings it includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access , without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle in the surroundings , as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure on the right image , the effect occurs along the curved wall as a wall jet to compare experiment with a theoretical model , we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width h along a circular wall of radius r with a much smaller radius ( 12 centimeters in the image on the right ) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet , creating a pressure gradient depending upon h/r , the relative curvature experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) , '' the curved wall effect '' in 2nd cranfield fluidics conference , cambridge , 3 janvier 1967 above a critical ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall this is '' a true coandă effect '' as the jet clings to the wall '' at a nearly constant pressure '' as in a conventional wall jet 8 , coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs , and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution : the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above , outside the nozzle a rough calculation has been tried that gives the separation angle as a function of and the reynolds number : the results are reported on the image , e.g other experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that coandă effect does not occur in a laminar flow , and the critical h/r ratios for small reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of a free jet of width h , deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r , between a first contact a and separation at b , including a deflection angle θ let us note the pressure and the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure , and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in a and θ in b then the velocity is found to be : : \frac\bigg ) \bigg ] an image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of the relative curvature h/r , and the same angle θ as those found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established : it may be found in reference ( 15 ) p & nbsp ; 104 and both images are quite similar : coanda effect of a free jet is inertial , the same as coanda effect of a wall jet the coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a coandă effect mixer

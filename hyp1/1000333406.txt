an early description of this phenomenon was provided by thomas young in a lecture given to the royal society in 1800 : the lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle bring a convex body into contact with the side of the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately show the current is deflected towards the body ; and if the body be at liberty to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current the pressure of the air jet is actually supplementing the pressure of the atmosphere , a.k.a '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' the first official documents that explicitly mention the coandă effect were two 1936 patents by henri coandă 3,261,162 , lifting device coanda effect , usa this name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist theodore von kármán , who had with coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) the resultant forces from this low pressure tube end up balancing any perpendicular flow instability , which stabilises the jet in a straight line coanda effect retrieved 17 november 2017 the jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ( diagram 4 ) , because each ( infinitesimally small ) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface retrieved 17 november 2017 if the surface is not too sharply curved , the jet can , under the right circumstances , adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface , and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction the forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows these coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion , depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface early sources provide information , both theoretical and experimental , needed to derive by comparison a detailed explanation of the coandă effect and its limits coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a free jet or a wall jet young as '' the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle '' , represents a free jet emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings it includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access , without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle in the surroundings , as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure on the right image , the effect occurs along the curved wall as a wall jet the image here on the right represents a two dimensional wall jet between two parallel plane walls , where the '' obstacle '' is a quarter cylindrical portion following the flat horizontal rectangular orifice , so that no fluid at all is entrained from the surroundings along the wall , but only on the opposite side in turbulent mixing with ambient air to compare experiment with a theoretical model , we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width h along a circular wall of radius r a wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall , say of infinite radius , or rather whose radius is the radius of the earth without separation because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall this pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises , and disappear at the point where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall , where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure ( and the transverse gradient becomes zero ) experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) a coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment : a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9° , followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer , subject to this positive longitudinal gradient however , if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5 , the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall ( until the wall ends – ; see diagram on the right ) this is '' a true coandă effect '' as the jet clings to the wall '' at a nearly constant pressure '' as in a conventional wall jet , vii , 3 , , 1954 of an inviscid flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall , where a singular point appears with an infinite slope of the surface pressure curve 8 , coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs , and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution : the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above , outside the nozzle then , viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall van dyke ( 1969 ) , higher-order boundary-layer theory , annual review of fluid mechanics quoted in lift ( force ) wikipedia article , §10.3 , the derivation of his equation ( 4c ) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible an alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates other experiments made in 2004 with a wall jet along a circular wall show that coandă effect does not occur in a laminar flow , and the critical h/r ratios for small reynolds numbers are much smaller than those for turbulent flow then the velocity is found to be : : \frac\bigg ) \bigg ] an image of the surface pressure distribution of the jet round the cylindrical surface using the same values of the relative curvature h/r , and the same angle θ as those found for the wall jet reported in the image on the right side here has been established : it may be found in reference ( 15 ) p '' lift from flow turning nasa glenn research center the flow from a high speed jet engine mounted in a pod over the wing produces increased lift by dramatically increasing the velocity gradient in the shear flow in the boundary layer the coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball , when a ship moves through water ) the coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet , causing it to follow the shape of the ship 's hull

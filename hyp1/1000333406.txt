an early description of this phenomenon was provided by thomas young in a lecture given to the royal society in 1800 : the lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle a hundred years later , henri coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his coandă-1910 aircraft , which mounted an unusual engine he designed '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' the first official documents that explicitly mention the coandă effect were two 1936 patents by henri coandă a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) the resultant forces from this low pressure tube end up balancing any perpendicular flow instability , which stabilises the jet in a straight line however , if a solid surface is placed close , and approximately parallel to the jet ( diagram 2 ) , then the entrainment ( and therefore removal ) of air from between the solid surface and the jet causes a reduction in air pressure on that side of the jet that can not be balanced as rapidly as the low pressure region on the '' open '' side of the jet the pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface , and then to adhere to it ( diagram 3 ) coanda effect retrieved 17 november 2017 the jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ( diagram 4 ) , because each ( infinitesimally small ) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface retrieved 17 november 2017 if the surface is not too sharply curved , the jet can , under the right circumstances , adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface , and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface the coandă effect can be induced in any fluid , and is therefore equally effective in water as in air coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a free jet or a wall jet on the left image of the preceding section : '' the mechanism of coanda effect '' , the effect as described , in the terms of t young as '' the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle '' , represents a free jet emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings on the right image , the effect occurs along the curved wall as a wall jet a wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall , say of infinite radius , or rather whose radius is the radius of the earth without separation because the surface pressure as well as the external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall with a much smaller radius ( 12 centimeters in the image on the right ) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet , creating a pressure gradient depending upon h/r , the relative curvature this pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises , and disappear at the point where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall , where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure ( and the transverse gradient becomes zero ) experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) , déviation d ’ un jet par adhérence à une paroi convexe in journal de physique et le radium , avril 1958 , paris , pp.1–12a kadosch m , '' the curved wall effect '' in 2nd cranfield fluidics conference , cambridge , 3 janvier 1967 above a critical ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall a coandă effect is therefore not seen here but only a local attachment : a pressure smaller than atmospheric pressure appears on the wall along a distance corresponding to a small angle of 9° , followed by an equal angle of 9° where this pressure increases up to atmospheric pressure at the separation of the boundary layer , subject to this positive longitudinal gradient however , if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5 , the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall ( until the wall ends – ; see diagram on the right ) this is '' a true coandă effect '' as the jet clings to the wall '' at a nearly constant pressure '' as in a conventional wall jet , vii , 3 , , 1954 of an inviscid flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall , where a singular point appears with an infinite slope of the surface pressure curve then , viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall van dyke ( 1969 ) , higher-order boundary-layer theory , annual review of fluid mechanics quoted in lift ( force ) wikipedia article , §10.3 , the derivation of his equation ( 4c ) also shows that the contribution of viscous stress to flow turning is negligible an alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of a free jet of width h , deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r , between a first contact a and separation at b , including a deflection angle θ moreover , in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form , giving the distribution of velocity along the circular wall let us note the pressure and the velocity along the free streamline at the ambient pressure , and γ the angle along the wall which is zero in a and θ in b & nbsp ; 104 and both images are quite similar : coanda effect of a free jet is inertial , the same as coanda effect of a wall jet the coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on aircraft , where air moving over the wing can be '' bent down '' towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing the coandă effect can be demonstrated by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball while the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above ( if one could see the air flow ) , the cause is not really the coandă effect

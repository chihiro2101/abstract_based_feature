the hotter the flame and the closer to the surface the greater the effect will be seen a hundred years later , henri coandă identified an application of the effect during experiments with his coandă-1910 aircraft , which mounted an unusual engine he designed the motor-driven turbine pushed hot air rearward , and coandă noticed that the airflow was attracted to nearby surfaces in 1934 coandă obtained a patent in france for a '' method and apparatus for deviation of a fluid into another fluid '' the effect was described as the '' deviation of a plain jet of a fluid that penetrates another fluid in the vicinity of a convex wall '' the first official documents that explicitly mention the coandă effect were two 1936 patents by henri coandă 3,261,162 , lifting device coanda effect , usa this name was accepted by the leading aerodynamicist theodore von kármán , who had with coandă a long scientific relationship on aerodynamics problems a free jet of air entrains molecules of air from its immediate surroundings causing an axisymmetrical '' tube '' or '' sleeve '' of low pressure around the jet ( see diagram 1 ) the pressure difference across the jet causes the jet to deviate towards the nearby surface , and then to adhere to it ( diagram 3 ) coanda effect retrieved 17 november 2017 the jet adheres even better to curved surfaces ( diagram 4 ) , because each ( infinitesimally small ) incremental change in direction of the surface brings about the effects described for the initial bending of the jet towards the surface retrieved 17 november 2017 if the surface is not too sharply curved , the jet can , under the right circumstances , adhere to the surface even after flowing 180° round a cylindrically curved surface , and thus travel in a direction opposite to its initial direction the forces that cause these changes in the direction of flow of the jet cause an equal and opposite force on the surface along which the jet flows these coandă effect induced forces can be harnessed to cause lift and other forms of motion , depending on the orientation of the jet and the surface to which the jet adheres a small '' lip '' on the surface at the point where the jet starts to flow over that surface ( diagram 5 ) enhances the initial deviation of the direction of flow of the jet , and it subsequently adheres to the surface the coandă effect can be induced in any fluid , and is therefore equally effective in water as in air coandă effect may occur along a curved wall either in a free jet or a wall jet young as '' the lateral pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an obstacle '' , represents a free jet emerging from an orifice and an obstacle in the surroundings it includes the tendency of a free jet emerging from an orifice to entrain fluid from the surroundings confined with limited access , without developing any region of lower pressure when there is no obstacle in the surroundings , as is the case on the opposite side where turbulent mixing occurs at ambient pressure on the right image , the effect occurs along the curved wall as a wall jet to compare experiment with a theoretical model , we first refer to a two-dimensional plane wall jet of width h along a circular wall of radius r with a much smaller radius ( 12 centimeters in the image on the right ) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet , creating a pressure gradient depending upon h/r , the relative curvature this pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises , and disappear at the point where the jet boundary layer separates from the wall , where the wall pressure reaches atmospheric pressure ( and the transverse gradient becomes zero ) experiments made in 1956 with turbulent air jets at a reynolds number of 10 6 at various jet widths show the pressures measured along a circularly curved wall ( radius at a series of horizontal distance from the origin of the jet ( see the diagram on the right ) , '' the curved wall effect '' in 2nd cranfield fluidics conference , cambridge , 3 janvier 1967 above a critical ratio of 0.5 only local effects at the origin of the jet are seen extending over a small angle of 18° along the curved wall however , if the ratio is smaller than the critical value of 0.5 , the lower than ambient pressure measured on the wall seen at the origin of the jet continues along the wall ( until the wall ends – ; see diagram on the right ) , vii , 3 , , 1954 of an inviscid flow along a circular wall shows that an inviscid solution exists with any curvature and any given deflection angle up to a separation point on the wall , where a singular point appears with an infinite slope of the surface pressure curve 8 , coandă et le jet qui soulève les aeronefs , and shows inertial effects represented by the inviscid solution : the calculated pressure field is similar to the experimental one described above , outside the nozzle then , viscosity only produces a boundary layer along the wall and turbulent mixing with ambient air as in a conventional wall jet—except that this boundary layer separates under the action of the difference between the finally ambient pressure and a smaller surface pressure along the wall an alternative way would be to calculate the deflection angle at which the boundary layer subjected to the inviscid pressure field separates woods also made the calculation of the inviscid two-dimensional flow of a free jet of width h , deflected round a circularly cylindrical surface of radius r , between a first contact a and separation at b , including a deflection angle θ moreover , in the case of a free jet the equation can be solved in closed form , giving the distribution of velocity along the circular wall the coandă effect has important applications in various high-lift devices on aircraft , where air moving over the wing can be '' bent down '' towards the ground using flaps and a jet sheet blowing over the curved surface of the top of the wing due to the slope , the debris falls from the screens without mechanical clearing , and due to the wires of the screen optimizing the coandă effect , the water flows through the screen to the penstocks leading the water to the turbines in meteorology , the coandă effect theory has also been applied to some air streams flowing out of mountain ranges such as the carpathian mountains and transylvanian alps , where effects on agriculture and vegetation have been noted the coandă effect is also used to mix two different fluids in a coandă effect mixer , when a ship moves through water ) the coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet , causing it to follow the shape of the ship 's hull

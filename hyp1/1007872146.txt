the first sea-based missile deterrent forces were a small number of conventionally powered cruise missile submarines ( ssg ) and surface ships fielded by the united states and the soviet union in the 1950s , deploying the regulus missile and the soviet p-5 pyatyorka ( ss-n-3 shaddock ) , both land attack cruise missiles that could be submarine-launched cruise missile although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 imperial japanese navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today ’ s ballistic submarines , especially to the regulus missile program begun about a decade after world war ii the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail this submarine launched the world 's first slbm , an r-11fm ( ss-n-1 scud-a , naval modification of ss-1 scud ) on 16 september 1955 five additional project v611 and av611 ( zulu v class ) submarines became the world 's first operational ssbs with two r-11fm missiles each , entering service in 1956–57 the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 the polaris missile and the first us ssbns were developed by a special project office under rear admiral william raborn , appointed by chief of naval operations admiral arleigh burke nuclear power was a crucial advance , allowing a ballistic missile submarine to remain undetected at sea by remaining submerged or occasionally at periscope depth for an entire patrol a significant difference between us and soviet slbms was the fuel type ; all us slbms have been solid fueled while all soviet and russian slbms were liquid fueled except for the russian rsm-56 bulava , which entered service in 2014 the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' the american large ssbn was the , also called the '' trident submarine '' , with the largest ssbn armament ever of 24 missiles , initially trident i but built with much larger tubes for the ugm-133 trident ii , which entered service in 1990 when the commenced sea trials in 1980 , two us ssbns had their missiles removed to comply with salt treaty requirements ; the remaining eight were converted to attack submarines ( ssn ) by the end of 1982 these were all in the pacific , and the guam ssbn base was disestablished ; the first several ohio-class boats used new trident facilities at naval submarine base bangor , washington the soviet large ssbn was the project 941 akula , more famously known as the typhoon class ( and not to be confused with the project 971 shchuka attack submarine , called '' akula '' by nato ) attack submarines specialize in combat with other vessels ( including enemy submarines and merchant shipping ) , and cruise missile submarines are designed to attack large warships and tactical targets on land ssbn is the us navy hull classification symbol for a nuclear-powered , ballistic missile-carrying submarine in the us navy , ssbns are sometimes called fleet ballistic missile submarines , or fbms royal navy – 4 in service united states – 14 in service ( 4 have been converted into cruise missile submarines )

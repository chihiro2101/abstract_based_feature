although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 imperial japanese navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today ’ s ballistic submarines , especially to the regulus missile program begun about a decade after world war ii the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail this submarine launched the world 's first slbm , an r-11fm ( ss-n-1 scud-a , naval modification of ss-1 scud ) on 16 september 1955 five additional project v611 and av611 ( zulu v class ) submarines became the world 's first operational ssbs with two r-11fm missiles each , entering service in 1956–57 the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 the polaris missile and the first us ssbns were developed by a special project office under rear admiral william raborn , appointed by chief of naval operations admiral arleigh burke nuclear power was a crucial advance , allowing a ballistic missile submarine to remain undetected at sea by remaining submerged or occasionally at periscope depth for an entire patrol a significant difference between us and soviet slbms was the fuel type ; all us slbms have been solid fueled while all soviet and russian slbms were liquid fueled except for the russian rsm-56 bulava , which entered service in 2014 the soviets were only a year behind the us with their first ssbn , the ill-fated k-19 of project 658 ( hotel class ) , commissioned in november 1960 the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' thanks to nato and the us possession of guam , us ssbns were permanently forward deployed at advanced refit sites in holy loch , scotland ; rota , spain ; and guam by the middle 1960s , resulting in short transit times to patrol areas near the soviet union with two rotating crews per ssbn , about one-third of the total us force could be in a patrol area at any time the missiles were the r-29 vysota series ( ss-n-8 , ss-n-18 , ss-n-23 ) , equipped on delta-class submarine ( delta i through delta iv classes ) a total of 43 delta-class boats of all types entered service 1972–1990 , with the ss-n-18 on the delta iii class and the r-29rm shtil ( ss-n-23 ) on the delta iv class both the united states and the soviet union commissioned larger ssbns designed for new missiles in 1981 the american large ssbn was the , also called the '' trident submarine '' , with the largest ssbn armament ever of 24 missiles , initially trident i but built with much larger tubes for the ugm-133 trident ii , which entered service in 1990 in both cases , ssbn submarines operate on a two-crew concept , with two complete crews – including two captains – called gold and blue in the united states , starboard and port in the united kingdom royal navy – 4 in service united states – 14 in service ( 4 have been converted into cruise missile submarines )

the first sea-based missile deterrent forces were a small number of conventionally powered cruise missile submarines ( ssg ) and surface ships fielded by the united states and the soviet union in the 1950s , deploying the regulus missile and the soviet p-5 pyatyorka ( ss-n-3 shaddock ) , both land attack cruise missiles that could be submarine-launched cruise missile although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 imperial japanese navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today ’ s ballistic submarines , especially to the regulus missile program begun about a decade after world war ii the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail this submarine launched the world 's first slbm , an r-11fm ( ss-n-1 scud-a , naval modification of ss-1 scud ) on 16 september 1955 five additional project v611 and av611 ( zulu v class ) submarines became the world 's first operational ssbs with two r-11fm missiles each , entering service in 1956–57 the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 george washington was redesigned and rebuilt early in construction from a fast attack submarine , uss scorpion , with a missile compartment welded into the middle nuclear power was a crucial advance , allowing a ballistic missile submarine to remain undetected at sea by remaining submerged or occasionally at periscope depth for an entire patrol a significant difference between us and soviet slbms was the fuel type ; all us slbms have been solid fueled while all soviet and russian slbms were liquid fueled except for the russian rsm-56 bulava , which entered service in 2014 with more missiles on one us ssbn than on five golf-class boats , the soviets rapidly fell behind in sea-based deterrent capability the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' the yankee class was initially equipped with the r-27 zyb missile ( ss-n-6 ) with a range of the soviet bases , in the murmansk area for the atlantic and the petropavlovsk-kamchatsky area for the pacific , required their ssbns to make a long transit ( through nato-monitored waters in the atlantic ) to their mid-ocean patrol areas to hold the continental united states ( conus ) at risk the new missiles had increased range and eventually multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles ( mirv ) , multiple warheads that could each hit a different target the delta i class had 12 missiles each ; the others have 16 missiles each eighteen ohio-class boats were commissioned by 1997 , four of which were converted as cruise missile submarines ( ssgn ) in the 2000s to comply with start i treaty requirements the ss denotes '' submarine '' or '' submersible '' , the b denotes '' ballistic missile , '' and the n denotes '' nuclear powered royal navy – 4 in service united states – 14 in service ( 4 have been converted into cruise missile submarines )

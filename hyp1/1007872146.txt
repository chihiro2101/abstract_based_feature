the first sea-based missile deterrent forces were a small number of conventionally powered cruise missile submarines ( ssg ) and surface ships fielded by the united states and the soviet union in the 1950s , deploying the regulus missile and the soviet p-5 pyatyorka ( ss-n-3 shaddock ) , both land attack cruise missiles that could be submarine-launched cruise missile although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail five additional project v611 and av611 ( zulu v class ) submarines became the world 's first operational ssbs with two r-11fm missiles each , entering service in 1956–57 the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 the polaris missile and the first us ssbns were developed by a special project office under rear admiral william raborn , appointed by chief of naval operations admiral arleigh burke nuclear power was a crucial advance , allowing a ballistic missile submarine to remain undetected at sea by remaining submerged or occasionally at periscope depth for an entire patrol a significant difference between us and soviet slbms was the fuel type ; all us slbms have been solid fueled while all soviet and russian slbms were liquid fueled except for the russian rsm-56 bulava , which entered service in 2014 the soviets were only a year behind the us with their first ssbn , the ill-fated k-19 of project 658 ( hotel class ) , commissioned in november 1960 the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' that resulted in only a small percentage of the soviet force occupying patrol areas at any time and was a great motivation for longer-range soviet slbms , which would allow them to patrol close to their bases in areas sometimes referred to as '' deep bastions '' the ss-n-8 , with a range of , entered service on the first delta-i boat in 1972 , before the yankee class was even completed a total of 43 delta-class boats of all types entered service 1972–1990 , with the ss-n-18 on the delta iii class and the r-29rm shtil ( ss-n-23 ) on the delta iv class thirty-one of the 41 original us ssbns were built with larger diameter launch tubes with future missiles in mind the american large ssbn was the , also called the '' trident submarine '' , with the largest ssbn armament ever of 24 missiles , initially trident i but built with much larger tubes for the ugm-133 trident ii , which entered service in 1990 the soviet large ssbn was the project 941 akula , more famously known as the typhoon class ( and not to be confused with the project 971 shchuka attack submarine , called '' akula '' by nato ) ballistic missile submarines are designed for stealth to avoid detection at all costs , and that makes nuclear power , allowing almost the entire patrol to be conducted submerged , very important in the us navy , ssbns are sometimes called fleet ballistic missile submarines , or fbms russia – 4 active delta class – 1 delta iii class in service , 6 delta iv class in service

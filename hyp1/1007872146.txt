although these forces served until 1964 and ( on the soviet side ) were augmented by the nuclear-powered echo-class submarine ssgns , they were rapidly eclipsed by slbms carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines ( ssbns ) beginning in 1960 imperial japanese navy s are considered the strategic predecessors to today ’ s ballistic submarines , especially to the regulus missile program begun about a decade after world war ii the first nation to field ballistic missile submarines ( ssb ) was the soviet union , whose first experimental ssb was a converted project 611 ( zulu iv class ) diesel-powered submarine equipped with a single ballistic missile launch tube in its sail five additional project v611 and av611 ( zulu v class ) submarines became the world 's first operational ssbs with two r-11fm missiles each , entering service in 1956–57 the initial r-13 ( ss-n-4 ) ballistic missiles could only be launched with the submarine on the surface and the missile raised to the top of the launch tube , but were followed by r-21 ( ss-n-5 ) missiles beginning in 1963 , which were launched with the submarine submerged the world 's first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine ( ssbn ) was with 16 polaris a-1 missiles , which entered service in december 1959 and conducted the first ssbn deterrent patrol november 1960 – january 1961 george washington was redesigned and rebuilt early in construction from a fast attack submarine , uss scorpion , with a missile compartment welded into the middle nuclear power was a crucial advance , allowing a ballistic missile submarine to remain undetected at sea by remaining submerged or occasionally at periscope depth for an entire patrol a significant difference between us and soviet slbms was the fuel type ; all us slbms have been solid fueled while all soviet and russian slbms were liquid fueled except for the russian rsm-56 bulava , which entered service in 2014 with more missiles on one us ssbn than on five golf-class boats , the soviets rapidly fell behind in sea-based deterrent capability the soviets were only a year behind the us with their first ssbn , the ill-fated k-19 of project 658 ( hotel class ) , commissioned in november 1960 the first soviet ssbn with 16 missiles was the yankee-class submarine , the first of which entered service in 1967 , by which time the us had commissioned 41 ssbns , nicknamed the '' 41 for freedom '' the ss-n-8 , with a range of , entered service on the first delta-i boat in 1972 , before the yankee class was even completed the new missiles had increased range and eventually multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles ( mirv ) , multiple warheads that could each hit a different target both the united states and the soviet union commissioned larger ssbns designed for new missiles in 1981 these were all in the pacific , and the guam ssbn base was disestablished ; the first several ohio-class boats used new trident facilities at naval submarine base bangor , washington missiles are launched upwards with an initial velocity sufficient for them to pop above the surface , at which point their rocket motors fire , beginning the characteristic parabolic climb-from-launch of a ballistic missile ssbn is the us navy hull classification symbol for a nuclear-powered , ballistic missile-carrying submarine in the us navy , ssbns are sometimes called fleet ballistic missile submarines , or fbms royal navy – 4 in service united states – 14 in service ( 4 have been converted into cruise missile submarines )

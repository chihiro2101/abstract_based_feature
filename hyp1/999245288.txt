the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus the neurons of the ens are collected into two types of ganglia : myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus myenteric plexuses are located between the inner and outer layers of the muscularis externa , while submucosal plexuses are located in the submucosa auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract the anatomy of the plexus is similar to the anatomy of the central nervous system the plexus includes sensory receptors , such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors , that are used to provide sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function in humans and other mammals , peristalsis is found in the smooth muscles of the digestive tract to propel contents through the digestive system neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain , the gut , and their interactions with relevance to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders american neurogastroenterology and motility society anms - american neurogastroenterology and motility society european society of neurogastroenterology and motility esnm - european society for neurogastroenterology & motility neurogastroenterology & motility ( 1999 ) , the second brain : a groundbreaking new understanding of nervous disorders of the stomach and intestine , harper perennial ,

the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus the anatomy of the plexus is similar to the anatomy of the central nervous system the plexus includes sensory receptors , such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors , that are used to provide sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system the ens is capable of autonomous functions like the coordination of reflexes ; although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system , it can and does operate independently of the brain and the spinal cord the enteric nervous system has been described as a '' second brain '' for several reasons the enteric nervous system can operate autonomously it normally communicates with the central nervous system ( cns ) through the parasympathetic ( e.g however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function the enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 & nbsp ; neurotransmitters , most of which are identical to the ones found in cns , such as acetylcholine , dopamine , and serotonin neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain , the gut , and their interactions with relevance to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders specifically , neurogastroenterology focuses on the functions , malfunctions , and the malformations of the sympathetic , parasympathetic , and enteric divisions of the digestive tract

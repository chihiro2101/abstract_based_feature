the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus the neurons of the ens are collected into two types of ganglia : myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus myenteric plexuses are located between the inner and outer layers of the muscularis externa , while submucosal plexuses are located in the submucosa auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract the plexus includes sensory receptors , such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors , that are used to provide sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system the submucosal plexus ( also known as meissner 's plexus ) is found in the submucosal layer of the gastrointestinal tract the enteric nervous system has been described as a '' second brain '' for several reasons the enteric nervous system can operate autonomously however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain , the gut , and their interactions with relevance to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders

the enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500 million neurons ; alternate source at website : ( including the various types of dogiel cells ) , 0.5 % of the number of neurons in the brain , five times as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal cord , and about as many as in the whole nervous system of a cat the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus the neurons of the ens are collected into two types of ganglia : myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract the plexus includes sensory receptors , such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors , that are used to provide sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system the enteric nervous system has been described as a '' second brain '' for several reasons however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input the enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 & nbsp ; neurotransmitters , most of which are identical to the ones found in cns , such as acetylcholine , dopamine , and serotonin in addition , ens contains support cells which are similar to astroglia of the brain and a diffusion barrier around the capillaries surrounding ganglia which is similar to the bloodâ€“brain barrier of cerebrum blood vessels neurogastroenterology encompasses the study of the brain , the gut , and their interactions with relevance to the understanding and management of gastrointestinal motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders

the enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500 million neurons ; alternate source at website : ( including the various types of dogiel cells ) , 0.5 % of the number of neurons in the brain , five times as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal cord , and about as many as in the whole nervous system of a cat the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus myenteric plexuses are located between the inner and outer layers of the muscularis externa , while submucosal plexuses are located in the submucosa auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract the ens is capable of autonomous functions like the coordination of reflexes ; although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system , it can and does operate independently of the brain and the spinal cord the enteric nervous system has been described as a '' second brain '' for several reasons it normally communicates with the central nervous system ( cns ) through the parasympathetic ( e.g however , vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed , the enteric nervous system continues to function in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input functional gastrointestinal disorder are a class of gastrointestinal disorders where there is a malfunction in the normal activities of the gastrointestinal tract , but there are no structural abnormalities that can explain the cause ( 1999 ) , the second brain : a groundbreaking new understanding of nervous disorders of the stomach and intestine , harper perennial ,

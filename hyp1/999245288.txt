the enteric nervous system in humans consists of some 500 million neurons ; alternate source at website : ( including the various types of dogiel cells ) , 0.5 % of the number of neurons in the brain , five times as many as the one hundred million neurons in the human spinal cord , and about as many as in the whole nervous system of a cat the enteric nervous system is embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system , beginning in the esophagus and extending down to the anus the neurons of the ens are collected into two types of ganglia : myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus auerbach 's plexus , also known as the myenteric plexus , is a collection of unmyelinated fibers and postganglionic autonomic cell bodies that lie between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract the anatomy of the plexus is similar to the anatomy of the central nervous system the plexus includes sensory receptors , such as chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors , that are used to provide sensory input to the interneurons in the enteric nervous system the ens is capable of autonomous functions like the coordination of reflexes ; although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system , it can and does operate independently of the brain and the spinal cord the enteric nervous system has been described as a '' second brain '' for several reasons in vertebrates , the enteric nervous system includes efferent neurons , afferent neurons , and interneurons , all of which make the enteric nervous system capable of carrying reflexes and acting as an integrating center in the absence of cns input the enteric nervous system also makes use of more than 30 & nbsp ; neurotransmitters , most of which are identical to the ones found in cns , such as acetylcholine , dopamine , and serotonin functional gastrointestinal disorder are a class of gastrointestinal disorders where there is a malfunction in the normal activities of the gastrointestinal tract , but there are no structural abnormalities that can explain the cause

as ding ( 2005 ) notes , '' the dungan people derive from china 's hui people , and now live mainly in kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan this people have now developed a separate ethnicity outside china , yet they have close relations with the hui people in culture , ethnic characteristics and ethnic identity '' today the dungans play a role as cultural '' shuttles '' and economic mediators between central asia and the chinese world husei daurov , the president of the dungan center , дауров хусей шимарович ( '' best people '' , the great international encyclopedia ) has succeeded in transforming cultural exchanges into commercial partnerships in february 2020 , a conflict broke out between ethnic kazakhs and dungans in the korday area in kazakhstan on the border to kyrgyzstan the dungan language , which the dungan people call the '' hui language '' ( хуэйзў йүян or huejzw jyian ) , is similar to the zhongyuan mandarin , which is widely spoken in the south of gansu and the west of guanzhong in shaanxi in china some dungan vocabulary may sound old-fashioned to chinese people since the 1940s , the language has been written in cyrillic script , demonstrating that chinese can be written with an alphabet ( compare the pinyin system ) unlike other minority nationalities in central asia , such as the koryo-saram , most dungan people are trilingual more than two-thirds of the dungan also speak russian and a small proportion can speak kyrgyz or other languages belonging to the titular nationality of the countries where they live during the qing dynasty , the term zhongyuanren was synonymous with being mainstream chinese , especially referring to han chinese and hui muslims in xinjiang or central asia for religious reasons , while hui people do not consider themselves han and are not han chinese , they consider themselves part of the wider chinese race and refer to themselves as zhongyuanren zhongyuanren was used generally by turkic muslims to refer to han and hui chinese people

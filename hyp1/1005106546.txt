although these attacks were held , lanrezac asked joffre for permission to retreat 97 on 23 august joffre reported to adolphe messimy , the french war minister , that his fourth army was pressing into the ardennes with ( he believed , wrongly ) local numerical superiority , despite the fact that he had already received reports of french defeats in this sector on previous days the german fourth and fifth armies were in fact advancing against the french forces in front of them rather than moving westwards as joffre believed on 25 august , rejecting the advice of his staff officer general berthelot that lanrezac be ordered to attack westwards against the inside of the german right wing , he instead had major maurice gamelin draw up plans for a french concentration at amiens , with many of the troops drawn from the french right wing in alsace , and with regret also ordered the successful counterattacks of the third army and the army of lorraine be called off 116–18 michel-joseph maunoury was put in command of the newly formed sixth army , which initially assembled near amiens and then fell back toward paris ( 26 august ) after lanrezac spent the day arguing against the order , joffre visited him at 8.30 & nbsp ;

am on 4 september gallieni , who had learned from paris aviators the previous day that kluck 's german first army was marching south-east across paris , had the first of a series of telephone calls , conducted through aides , as joffre would not come to the phone , and gallieni refused to speak to anyone else 87–89 tuchman 1962 , pp at 10 & nbsp ; pm joffre issued general order no 6 , ordering a general allied offensive on 7 january 1915 , over joffre 's opposition , president poincaré came out in favour of the proposal of franchet d'espèrey , gallieni and justice minister aristide briand for an expedition to salonika , which he hoped would detach first turkey then austria-hungary , leaving germany '' doomed with viviani 's government in trouble following the resignation of theophile delcasse as foreign minister , the second battle of champagne and the bulgaria during world war i , viviani asked joffre , who had told him that nine out of ten generals would make poor ministers of war , whether gallieni would be a good replacement for millerand '' in the event , briand formed a new government on 29 october 1915 , with viviani as vice-president of the council of ministers ( deputy prime minister ) and gallieni as war minister castelnau ) be given strategic direction of the war—joffre did not favour this option , believing that governments rose and fell too frequently for this to be sensible—or else that joffre himself be appointed commander-in-chief over all fronts gallieni , who favoured a strong war ministry with his own operational staff , complained bitterly in his diary about the politicians ' unwillingness to stand up to joffre a presidential decree of 2 december made joffre '' commander-in-chief of the french armies '' ( generalissimo ) doughty 2005 , pp 82–83 in practice , joffre now took command over both salonika and the western front , but not morocco , algeria or tunisia 97–98 in autumn 1915 colonel émile driant , commander of a chasseurs brigade and a member of the army commission of the chamber of deputies , complained to gallieni of how joffre had been removing guns and garrisons from verdun and even preparing some forts for demolition 264 gallieni wrote to joffre ( 16 or 18 december 1915 ) , expressing concern at the state of trenches at verdun and elsewhere on the front ; in fact , matters were already being taken in hand at verdun the british government accepted the need to maintain the salonika bridgehead to keep the french happy , despite being sceptical about the idea that it would bring greece into the war on the allied side , but british military opinion did not favour any more commitment than necessary early in 1916 joffre asked the british commander-in-chief , douglas haig , to put in a good word with lord bertie , the british ambassador in paris , so that it would get back to the french government during the closed session ( 28 november – 7 december ) briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government , and in a speech of 29 november he promised to repeal the decree of 2 december 1915 and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government on 30 april the british major-general bridges lobbied for us troops to be used to reinforce the british army , arguing this would lessen the language and food differences doughty writes of the marne : '' gallieni 's role was important , but the key concept and decisions lay with joffre pont joffre ( joffre bridge ) , located in sherbrooke , québec , canada ( c ) united states of america joffre street in lowell , massachusetts

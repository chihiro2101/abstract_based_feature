although these attacks were held , lanrezac asked joffre for permission to retreat the german fourth and fifth armies were in fact advancing against the french forces in front of them rather than moving westwards as joffre believed in his memoirs joffre later admitted that he had been mistaken ( he was also unaware of the fall of namur and of the extent of the fighting at mons and charleroi on his left ) , but at the time he demanded that the french fourth army resume the offensive and provide lists of unsatisfactory officers for dismissal 116–18 michel-joseph maunoury was put in command of the newly formed sixth army , which initially assembled near amiens and then fell back toward paris ( 26 august ) terraine 1960 , p after lanrezac spent the day arguing against the order , joffre visited him at 8.30 & nbsp ;

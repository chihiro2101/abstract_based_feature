joffre was born in rivesaltes , pyrénées-orientales , into a family of vineyard owners he first saw active service as a junior artillery officer during the siege of paris in the franco-prussian war after the war he underwent further training at the école polytechnique before transferring to the génie ( engineers ) joffre subsequently spent much of his career in the colonies as a military engineer , serving with distinction in the keelung campaign during the sino-french war ( august 1884 – april 1885 ) as a major , he led a column from ségou to timbuktu in mali , where he recovered the remains of lt his mission killed over a hundred tuareg and captured fifteen hundred cattle 45–46 he served under joseph gallieni in madagascar and was promoted to général de brigade while serving there herwig 2009 , pp 136–37 after returning to france in 1903 to command the 19th cavalry brigade , he then moved to the war ministry in paris as director of engineers in 1904 the next year he was promoted to général de division , the highest rank in the french army at the time joffre commanded the 2nd army corps from 1908 until 1910 when he was appointed to the conseil supérieur de la guerre the minister of war adolphe messimy reorganized the high command of the french army in july 1911 general victor-constant michel , the vice president of the conseil supérieur de la guerre and commander-in-chief designate , was sacked after proposing a defensive strategy in the event of war with germany messimy took the opportunity to merge the office of vice president with the chief of the general staff and create a single professional head of the army the newly enhanced post was first offered to gallieni and paul pau , who both declined , leading to joffre 's appointment with the revival of the army and a purge of '' defensive-minded '' officers , first world war – willmott , h.p 52 he adopted the strategy devised by ferdinand foch , the deployment plan known as plan xvii , military history of the western world , 1957 , p after a left-wing government came to power in 1914 , he was due to be replaced by maurice sarrail in the autumn , but war broke out before this could take place on 15 august , after german cavalry had been spotted at dinant on the meuse , and after repeated warnings from charles lanrezac of the fifth army , joffre issued his instruction particuliere no 10 , stating that the main german effort would come through belgium 43 although joffre was aware ( 8am on 18 august ) that as many as fifteen german corps were moving through belgium ( in fact it was sixteen , and twenty-eight if the german fourth and fifth armies are also included ) , he believed that only a few of these would come west of the meuse , where he believed they could be held by the british and belgians the french third and fourth armies were preparing to attack into the ardennes , and he wanted lanrezac 's fifth army to attack the bulk of the german right wing on its west flank as – it was assumed – it attacked the left flank of french fourth army 54–55 the french first and second armies battle of lorraine on 19 and 20 august and were beaten back with severe loss by german forces , which were preparing for a counteroffensive 60 joffre believed ( 20 august ) that liège was still holding out ( in fact battle of liège ) , terraine 1960 , p 47 and hoped that lanrezac would be able to reach namur , which was expected to hold out for even longer the germans entered brussels that day , but joffre was convinced , after the defeat in alsace-lorraine and air and cavalry reports of strong german forces in belgium , that the german centre in the ardennes must be weak terraine 1960 , p 63 with the french third and fourth armies now battle of the ardennes , and the infantry outpacing their horsedrawn artillery , von bülow 's german second army attacked lanrezac and forced bridgeheads across the meuse 97 on 23 august joffre reported to adolphe messimy , the french war minister , that his fourth army was pressing into the ardennes with ( he believed , wrongly ) local numerical superiority , despite the fact that he had already received reports of french defeats in this sector on previous days the german fourth and fifth armies were in fact advancing against the french forces in front of them rather than moving westwards as joffre believed in his memoirs joffre later admitted that he had been mistaken ( he was also unaware of the fall of namur and of the extent of the fighting at mons and charleroi on his left ) , but at the time he demanded that the french fourth army resume the offensive and provide lists of unsatisfactory officers for dismissal 88–99 messimy fully supported joffre in his purge of unsuccessful generals , even suggesting that , as in 1793 , some of them simply ought to be executed 153 joffre turned up at lanrezac 's headquarters to supervise his conduct of the battle of guise ( 29 august ) , willing if necessary to sack him there and then messimy , the war minister , ordered joffre to provide three active corps to defend paris on 25 august , but joffre , regarding this as interference with strategy , ignored him the general promised to provide the three corps for paris if maunoury 's attack near amiens failed 399 on 30 august joffre recommended that the french government evacuate paris and learned of the russian disaster at tannenberg , although he was aware that two german corps were still headed east as reinforcements for east prussia at this stage his mind was still leaning towards berthelot 's old suggestion that the fifth army attack westwards against the inside of the german right wing 76–77 on 2 september , the anniversary of the battle of sedan , the government left paris for bordeaux he envisaged '' a battle '' , probably to take place around 8 september , '' between the horns of paris and verdun this was in line with his modification of instruction general no 4 ( 2 september ) , envisaging a giant pocket from paris to verdun , of which he enclosed copies to gallieni gallieni proposed , depending on how much further the germans were to be allowed to advance , to attack north of the marne on 6 september or south of the marne on 7 september while joffre was having dinner with the british liaison officer , sidney clive , and two visiting japanese officers , neither of whom appeared to understand a word of french , a message arrived from franchet d'espèrey saying that he would be ready to attack on 6 september at this point gallieni , who returned to paris to find joffre 's message from earlier in the day and a message from wilson , insisted on speaking to joffre personally on the telephone , informing him that it was too late to cancel the movement of maunoury 's army tuchman argues that he may simply have been swayed by the dominant personality of gallieni , his former superior at 10 & nbsp ; pm joffre issued general order no 6 , ordering a general allied offensive 190–91 on 7 september gallieni , who had been going over joffre 's head and speaking to the war minister and president raymond poincaré , was ordered not to communicate directly with the government 111 by early december 1914 gallieni was being mooted as a potential commander-in-chief in joffre 's place , or minister of war , or both '' in the event , briand formed a new government on 29 october 1915 , with viviani as vice-president of the council of ministers ( deputy prime minister ) and gallieni as war minister 226–29 as far back at 29 july 1915 joffre had demanded that he be appointed commander-in-chief over all french forces , including those at the dardanelles there was also friction over gallieni 's assertion of his right to appoint generals , joffre 's practice of communicating directly with the british generals rather than going through the war ministry , and gallieni 's maintaining contacts with generals whom joffre had replaced woodward , david r field marshal sir william robertson ( westport connecticut & london : praeger , 1998 , pp in the words of one french divisional commander , its loss would cost the french army a hundred thousand lives joffre 's political position had already weakened after the enormous losses of 1915 , and now rumours circulated in paris that joffre had ordered the abandonment of verdun when the germans first attacked 26 on 13 june pershing , who had landed at boulogne that morning , met joffre , paul painlevé ( war minister ) , viviani and foch ( chief of staff ) in paris while the battle of the marne was going on , he handled the problems faced by foch 's ninth army at the st gond marshes , by de langle 's fourth and sarrail 's third near verdun and by castelnau 's second in the nancy area 97 john eisenhower writes that joffre 's '' personality had a profound effect on the course of history '' and he became a household name in the united states a french aircraft carrier bearing joffre 's name was under construction at the start of world war ii but was never completed due to france 's rapid fall in 1940 joffre peak , a mountain in the lillooet ranges of

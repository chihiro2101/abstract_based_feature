joffre was born in rivesaltes , pyrénées-orientales , into a family of vineyard owners he entered the école polytechnique in 1870 and became a career officer he first saw active service as a junior artillery officer during the siege of paris in the franco-prussian war after the war he underwent further training at the école polytechnique before transferring to the génie ( engineers ) joffre subsequently spent much of his career in the colonies as a military engineer , serving with distinction in the keelung campaign during the sino-french war ( august 1884 – april 1885 ) as a major , he led a column from ségou to timbuktu in mali , where he recovered the remains of lt his mission killed over a hundred tuareg and captured fifteen hundred cattle 136–37 after returning to france in 1903 to command the 19th cavalry brigade , he then moved to the war ministry in paris as director of engineers in 1904 the next year he was promoted to général de division , the highest rank in the french army at the time subsequently he commanded the 6th infantry division and served as inspector of military schools joffre commanded the 2nd army corps from 1908 until 1910 when he was appointed to the conseil supérieur de la guerre the minister of war adolphe messimy reorganized the high command of the french army in july 1911 general victor-constant michel , the vice president of the conseil supérieur de la guerre and commander-in-chief designate , was sacked after proposing a defensive strategy in the event of war with germany the newly enhanced post was first offered to gallieni and paul pau , who both declined , leading to joffre 's appointment 52 he adopted the strategy devised by ferdinand foch , the deployment plan known as plan xvii after a left-wing government came to power in 1914 , he was due to be replaced by maurice sarrail in the autumn , but war broke out before this could take place at the outbreak of war , the french plan clashed with the german schlieffen plan , much to the detriment of the french 54–55 the french first and second armies battle of lorraine on 19 and 20 august and were beaten back with severe loss by german forces , which were preparing for a counteroffensive 60 joffre believed ( 20 august ) that liège was still holding out ( in fact battle of liège ) , terraine 1960 , p 47 and hoped that lanrezac would be able to reach namur , which was expected to hold out for even longer terraine 1960 , pp 64–65 the fifth army was also now attacked on its right by max von hausen 's german third army ; although these attacks were held , lanrezac asked joffre for permission to retreat terraine 1960 , p 97 on 23 august joffre reported to adolphe messimy , the french war minister , that his fourth army was pressing into the ardennes with ( he believed , wrongly ) local numerical superiority , despite the fact that he had already received reports of french defeats in this sector on previous days in his memoirs joffre later admitted that he had been mistaken ( he was also unaware of the fall of namur and of the extent of the fighting at mons and charleroi on his left ) , but at the time he demanded that the french fourth army resume the offensive and provide lists of unsatisfactory officers for dismissal 88–99 messimy fully supported joffre in his purge of unsuccessful generals , even suggesting that , as in 1793 , some of them simply ought to be executed 116–18 michel-joseph maunoury was put in command of the newly formed sixth army , which initially assembled near amiens and then fell back toward paris ( 26 august ) after a '' heated '' discussion , joffre had gamelin draw up a written order and signed it in lanrezac 's presence the general promised to provide the three corps for paris if maunoury 's attack near amiens failed at this stage his mind was still leaning towards berthelot 's old suggestion that the fifth army attack westwards against the inside of the german right wing 76–77 on 2 september , the anniversary of the battle of sedan , the government left paris for bordeaux tuchman 1962 , pp 392–94 , 399 he sacked lanrezac on the afternoon of 3 september , replacing him with the more aggressive louis franchet d'espèrey 181–83 on the night of 3–4 september joffre sent a handwritten note to gallieni , wanting maunoury to push east along the north bank of the marne , although not specifying a date this was in line with his modification of instruction general no 4 ( 2 september ) , envisaging a giant pocket from paris to verdun , of which he enclosed copies to gallieni that same afternoon , henry wilson , the bef sub-chief of staff , was negotiating separate plans with franchet d'espèrey , on the british right , which envisaged the sixth army attacking north of the marne tuchman argues that he may simply have been swayed by the dominant personality of gallieni , his former superior 87–90 senior 2012 , pp 190–91 on 7 september gallieni , who had been going over joffre 's head and speaking to the war minister and president raymond poincaré , was ordered not to communicate directly with the government this left joffre '' all-powerful '' ( in gallieni 's description ) , as he had sacked so many generals , leaving gallieni his only serious rival 111 by early december 1914 gallieni was being mooted as a potential commander-in-chief in joffre 's place , or minister of war , or both on 7 january 1915 , over joffre 's opposition , president poincaré came out in favour of the proposal of franchet d'espèrey , gallieni and justice minister aristide briand for an expedition to salonika , which he hoped would detach first turkey then austria-hungary , leaving germany '' doomed 29 joffre fought a further major offensive in the artois in spring 1915 '' in the event , briand formed a new government on 29 october 1915 , with viviani as vice-president of the council of ministers ( deputy prime minister ) and gallieni as war minister 226–29 as far back at 29 july 1915 joffre had demanded that he be appointed commander-in-chief over all french forces , including those at the dardanelles by november he was again lobbying poincaré that either a strong minister of war , backed by a strong chief of staff ( e.g castelnau ) be given strategic direction of the war—joffre did not favour this option , believing that governments rose and fell too frequently for this to be sensible—or else that joffre himself be appointed commander-in-chief over all fronts joffre met with poincaré and briand both before and after the meeting to discuss the issue on 1 december poincaré and briand met with gallieni , who agreed that joffre be commander-in-chief , with castelnau—who was soon sidelined—as his chief of staff , although under the war minister 's orders after considerable discussion this was approved by the chamber of deputies by 406–67 on 9 december doughty 2005 , pp there was also friction over gallieni 's assertion of his right to appoint generals , joffre 's practice of communicating directly with the british generals rather than going through the war ministry , and gallieni 's maintaining contacts with generals whom joffre had replaced the battle of verdun began on 21 february , reducing the planned french commitment to the somme joffre 's political position had already weakened after the enormous losses of 1915 , and now rumours circulated in paris that joffre had ordered the abandonment of verdun when the germans first attacked there was already a similar british mission being prepared , led by arthur balfour , foreign secretary and a former prime minister 44–45 georges boillot , winner of the french grand prix 1912 and 1913 , was joffre 's personal driver in 1914 , and joffre 's car tearing along roads became a familiar sight when he visited romania in 1920 , the casa capșa , purveyor to the royal court of romania , created the joffre cake in his honour ( f ) romania marshal joffre street ( formerly ion mihalache street ) , located in timișoara , romania

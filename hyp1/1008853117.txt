the basal leaves and the lower stem leaves have petioles , and as the leaves progress up the stem the petioles often decrease in length the leaf blades in different species may have one , three or five nerves some species have linear to leaf shape leaves , and others have leaf shape ; often the leaves decrease in size as they progress up the stems leaf bases gradually increase in width away from the petioles or the bases are leaf shape most species have leaf margins that are entire , but sometimes they are leaf shape the paleae ( chaffs on the receptacles of many asteraceae ) have orange to reddish purple ends , and are longer than the disc corollas the ray florets number 8–21 and the petal are dark purple to pale pink , white , or yellow the pollen is normally yellow in most species , but usually white in e the generic name echinacea is rooted in the greek word ἐχῖνος ( echinos ) , meaning hedgehog , in reference to the spiky appearance and feel of the flower heads dna analysis is applied to determine the number of echinacea species , allowing clear distinctions among species based on chemical differences in root metabolites echinacea products vary widely in composition some therapists have claimed that echinacea can help relieve side effects from cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy , but this has not been proven either muscle and joint pain has been associated with echinacea , but it may have been caused by cold or flu symptoms for which the echinacea products were administered echinacea extracts inhibited growth of three species of trypanosomatids : leishmania donovani , leishmania major , and trypanosoma brucei echinacea angustifolia was widely used by the north american indigenous peoples as folk medicine

europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century one of the most notable visitors was the dutch explorer robert jacob gordon , who mapped the region and gave the orange river its name the majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the sotho people ( colonial form basuto ) , but in the valleys of the orange and vaal were korana and other khoikhoi , and in the drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of bushmen in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country the leader of the first large party , hendrik potgieter , concluded an agreement with makwana , the chief of the bataung tribe of batswana , ceding to the farmers the country between the vet and vaal rivers the boers soon came into collision with mzilikazi 's raiding parties , which attacked boer hunters who crossed the vaal river in december 1836 the emigrants beyond the orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government dissensions speedily arose among the emigrants , whose numbers were constantly added to , and retief , potgieter and other leaders crossed the drakensberg and entered natal in 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of french protestant missionaries , and as the boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the british at the cape acting upon the advice of dr john philip , the superintendent of the london missionary society â€™ s stations in south africa , a treaty was concluded in 1843 with moshoeshoe , placing him under british protection by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony the year in which the treaty with moshoeshoe was made , several large parties of boers recrossed the drakensberg into the country north of the orange , refusing to remain in natal when the british annexed the newly formed boer republic of natalia to form the colony of natal some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule this fact induced mr justice menzies , one of the judges of the cape colony then on circuit at colesberg , to cross the orange and proclaim the country british territory in october 1842 the majority of the boer farmers in kok 's territory sent a deputation to the british commissioner in natal , henry cloete , asking for equal treatment with the griquas , and expressing the desire to come under british protection under such terms the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal he recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the griquas and basotho , and on 3 february 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring british sovereignty over the country between the orange and the vaal eastward to the drakensberg thereupon pretorius , with those most bitterly opposed to british rule , retreated across the vaal stuart , but he remained the british resident until july 1852 in 1851 moshoeshoe joined the republican party in the sovereignty in an invitation to pretorius to recross the vaal the intervention of pretorius resulted in the sand river convention of 1852 , which acknowledged the independence of the transvaal but left the status of the sovereignty untouched the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty '' a meeting of representatives of all european inhabitants of the sovereignty , elected on manhood suffrage , held at bloemfontein in june 1852 , nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of british rule there were among them numbers of farmers and tradesmen of british descent sir george clerk announced that , as the elected delegates were unwilling to take steps to form an independent government , he would enter into negotiations with other persons '' in withdrawing from the sovereignty the british government declared that it had '' no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the orange river with the exception of the griqua chief captain adam kok iii '' the country was declared a republic and named the orange free state the first president was josias philip hoffman , but he was accused of being too complaisant towards moshoeshoe and resigned , being succeeded in 1855 by jacobus nicolaas boshoff , one of the voortrekkers , who had previously taken an active part in the affairs of the natalia republic distracted among themselves , with the formidable basotho power on their southern and eastern flank , the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the transvaal boers of the south african republic marthinus pretorius , who had succeeded to his father 's position as commandant general of potchefstroom , wished to bring about a confederation between the two boer states peaceful overtures from pretorius were declined , and some of his partisans in the orange free state were accused of treason in february 1857 thereupon pretorius , aided by paul kruger , conducted a raid into the orange free state 's territory '' several of the malcontents in the orange free state who had joined pretorius permanently settled in the transvaal , and other orange free staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished this experience did not , however , heal the party strife within the orange free state in consequence of the dissensions among the burghers , president boshoff tendered his resignation in february 1858 , but was for a time induced to remain in office in the war the advantage rested with the basotho ; thereupon the orange free state appealed to sir george grey , who induced moshoeshoe to come to terms the peace was nominal only , while the burghers were also involved in disputes with other tribes by the sand river convention , independence had been granted to the boers living '' north of the vaal '' , and the dispute turned on the question as to what stream constituted the true upper course of that river when the british annexation took place a party in the volksraad wished to go to war with britain , but the counsels of president johannes brand prevailed the relations between the british and the orange free state , after the question of the boundary was settled , remained perfectly amicable down to the outbreak of the second boer war in 1899 the state , however , became increasingly identified with the reactionary party in the south african republic the orange free state began to expel british subjects in 1899 , and the first act of the second boer war was committed by orange free state boers , who , on 11 october 1899 , seized a train upon the border belonging to natal

europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century one of the most notable visitors was the dutch explorer robert jacob gordon , who mapped the region and gave the orange river its name the majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the sotho people ( colonial form basuto ) , but in the valleys of the orange and vaal were korana and other khoikhoi , and in the drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of bushmen early in the 19th century griqua established themselves north of the orange in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country in december 1836 the emigrants beyond the orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government in 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of french protestant missionaries , and as the boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the british at the cape acting upon the advice of dr john philip , the superintendent of the london missionary society ’ s stations in south africa , a treaty was concluded in 1843 with moshoeshoe , placing him under british protection by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony during their stay in natal the boers inflicted a severe defeat on the zulus under dingane in the battle of blood river in december 1838 , which , following on the flight of mzilikazi , greatly strengthened the position of moshoeshoe , whose power became a menace to that of the boer farmers trouble first arose , however , between the boers and the griqua in the philippolis district some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule the treaties gave great offence to the boers , who refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the native chiefs the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal in 1846 major warden occupied winburg for a short time , and the relations between the boers and the british were in a continual state of tension sir harry smith became governor of the cape at the end of 1847 a nominated legislative council was created , a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country , which was officially styled the orange river sovereignty the british resident had , however , no force sufficient to maintain his authority , and moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the europeans lord henry grey , secretary of state for war and the colonies , in a dispatch to sir harry smith dated 21 october 1851 , declared , '' the ultimate abandonment of the orange sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy '' a meeting of representatives of all european inhabitants of the sovereignty , elected on manhood suffrage , held at bloemfontein in june 1852 , nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of british rule there had been ministerial changes in england and the aberdeen ministry , then in power , adhered to the determination to withdraw from the sovereignty sir george russell clerk was sent out in 1853 as special commissioner '' for the settling and adjusting of the affairs '' of the sovereignty , and in august of that year he summoned a meeting of delegates to determine upon a form of self-government the majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of british rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies sir george clerk announced that , as the elected delegates were unwilling to take steps to form an independent government , he would enter into negotiations with other persons the orange river convention , recognising the independence of the country , was signed at bloemfontein on 23 february by sir george clerk and the republican committee , and in march the boer government assumed office and the republican flag was hoisted five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in london with the colonial secretary , the duke of newcastle , who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of british rule the colonial secretary added that it was impossible for england to supply troops to constantly advancing outposts , '' especially as cape town and the port of table bay were all she really required in south africa '' in withdrawing from the sovereignty the british government declared that it had '' no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the orange river with the exception of the griqua chief captain adam kok iii '' kok was not formidable in a military sense , nor could he prevent individual griquas from alienating their lands eventually , in 1861 , he sold his sovereign rights to the free state for £4000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as griqualand east on the abandonment of british rule , representatives of the people were elected and met at bloemfontein on 28 march 1854 , and between then and 18 april were engaged in framing a constitution the country was declared a republic and named the orange free state executive authority was entrusted to a president elected by the burghers from a list submitted by the volksraad distracted among themselves , with the formidable basotho power on their southern and eastern flank , the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the transvaal boers of the south african republic the majority of the burghers rallied to his support , and on 25 may , the two opposing forces faced one another on the banks of the rhenoster this proposition received the strong support of sir george grey , the then governor of cape colony , but his view did not commend itself to the british government , and was not adopted commandant marthinus wessel pretorius was , however , elected president in place of mr boshoff a treaty was signed at thaba bosiu in april 1866 , but war again broke out in 1867 , and the free state attracted to its side a large number of adventurers from all parts of south africa the offer was accepted , and on 27 october 1871 the district , together with some adjacent territory to which the transvaal had laid claim , was proclaimed , under the name of griqualand west , british territory in 1889 an agreement made between the orange free state and the cape colony government , whereby the latter was empowered to extend , at its own cost , its railway system to bloemfontein in 1898 the free state also acquiesced in the new convention arranged with regard to the customs union between the cape colony , natal , basutoland and the bechuanaland protectorate but events were moving rapidly in the transvaal , and matters had proceeded too far for the free state to turn back postal orders

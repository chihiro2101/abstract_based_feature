europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century one of the most notable visitors was the dutch explorer robert jacob gordon , who mapped the region and gave the orange river its name the majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the sotho people ( colonial form basuto ) , but in the valleys of the orange and vaal were korana and other khoikhoi , and in the drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of bushmen early in the 19th century griqua established themselves north of the orange in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country these emigrants left the cape colony for various reasons , but all shared the desire for independence from british authority the boers soon came into collision with mzilikazi 's raiding parties , which attacked boer hunters who crossed the vaal river in december 1836 the emigrants beyond the orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government after the defeat of mzilikazi the town of winburg ( so named by the boers in commemoration of their victory ) was founded , a volksraad elected , and piet retief , one of the ablest of the voortrekkers , chosen “ governor and commandant-general ” moshoeshoe , a minor basotho chief , had welded together a number of scattered and broken clans which had sought refuge in that mountainous region after fleeing from mzilikazi , and had formed the basotho nation which acknowledged him as king by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony the year in which the treaty with moshoeshoe was made , several large parties of boers recrossed the drakensberg into the country north of the orange , refusing to remain in natal when the british annexed the newly formed boer republic of natalia to form the colony of natal during their stay in natal the boers inflicted a severe defeat on the zulus under dingane in the battle of blood river in december 1838 , which , following on the flight of mzilikazi , greatly strengthened the position of moshoeshoe , whose power became a menace to that of the boer farmers some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule this fact induced mr justice menzies , one of the judges of the cape colony then on circuit at colesberg , to cross the orange and proclaim the country british territory in october 1842 the proclamation was disallowed by the governor , sir george napier , who , nevertheless , maintained that the boer farmers remained british subjects after this episode the british negotiated their treaties with adam kok iii and moshoeshoe bloemfontein lay to the south of the region settled by voortrekkers the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal he recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the griquas and basotho , and on 3 february 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring british sovereignty over the country between the orange and the vaal eastward to the drakensberg sir harry smith 's popularity among the boers gained for his policy considerable support , but the republican party , at whose head was andries pretorius , did not submit without a struggle in 1851 moshoeshoe joined the republican party in the sovereignty in an invitation to pretorius to recross the vaal the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty lord henry grey , secretary of state for war and the colonies , in a dispatch to sir harry smith dated 21 october 1851 , declared , '' the ultimate abandonment of the orange sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy '' a meeting of representatives of all european inhabitants of the sovereignty , elected on manhood suffrage , held at bloemfontein in june 1852 , nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of british rule sir george russell clerk was sent out in 1853 as special commissioner '' for the settling and adjusting of the affairs '' of the sovereignty , and in august of that year he summoned a meeting of delegates to determine upon a form of self-government the representations of their delegates , who drew up a proposed constitution retaining british control , were unavailing '' and then , '' wrote george mccall theal , '' was seen forced the strange spectacle of an english commissioner addressing men who wished to be free of british control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants , while for those who desired to remain british subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled he had no sympathising word '' in withdrawing from the sovereignty the british government declared that it had '' no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the orange river with the exception of the griqua chief captain adam kok iii '' on the abandonment of british rule , representatives of the people were elected and met at bloemfontein on 28 march 1854 , and between then and 18 april were engaged in framing a constitution the constitution was subsequently modified but remained of a liberal character distracted among themselves , with the formidable basotho power on their southern and eastern flank , the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the transvaal boers of the south african republic marthinus pretorius , who had succeeded to his father 's position as commandant general of potchefstroom , wished to bring about a confederation between the two boer states peaceful overtures from pretorius were declined , and some of his partisans in the orange free state were accused of treason in february 1857 thereupon pretorius , aided by paul kruger , conducted a raid into the orange free state 's territory the majority of the burghers rallied to his support , and on 25 may , the two opposing forces faced one another on the banks of the rhenoster president boshoff not only got together some 800 men within the orange free state , but he received offers of support from commandant stephanus schoeman , the transvaal leader in the zoutpansberg district and from commandant joubert of lydenburg '' several of the malcontents in the orange free state who had joined pretorius permanently settled in the transvaal , and other orange free staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished in the war the advantage rested with the basotho ; thereupon the orange free state appealed to sir george grey , who induced moshoeshoe to come to terms when the british annexation took place a party in the volksraad wished to go to war with britain , but the counsels of president johannes brand prevailed in spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the orange free state boers , living in the northern part of the country , went to the transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the british the orange free state began to expel british subjects in 1899 , and the first act of the second boer war was committed by orange free state boers , who , on 11 october 1899 , seized a train upon the border belonging to natal after the surrender of piet cronjé in the battle of paardeberg on 27 february 1900 , bloemfontein was occupied by the british troops under lord roberts from 13 march onward , and on 28 may a proclamation was issued annexing the free state to the british dominions under the title of orange river colony

europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century one of the most notable visitors was the dutch explorer robert jacob gordon , who mapped the region and gave the orange river its name early in the 19th century griqua established themselves north of the orange in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country these emigrants left the cape colony for various reasons , but all shared the desire for independence from british authority in the meantime another party of cape dutch emigrants had settled at thaba nchu , where the wesleyans had a mission station for the barolong in december 1836 the emigrants beyond the orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government the emigrants already numbered some 500 men , besides women and children and many servants dissensions speedily arose among the emigrants , whose numbers were constantly added to , and retief , potgieter and other leaders crossed the drakensberg and entered natal meanwhile , a new power had arisen along the upper orange and in the valley of the caledon in 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of french protestant missionaries , and as the boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the british at the cape acting upon the advice of dr john philip , the superintendent of the london missionary society ’ s stations in south africa , a treaty was concluded in 1843 with moshoeshoe , placing him under british protection by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony the effect was to precipitate collisions between all three parties the year in which the treaty with moshoeshoe was made , several large parties of boers recrossed the drakensberg into the country north of the orange , refusing to remain in natal when the british annexed the newly formed boer republic of natalia to form the colony of natal trouble first arose , however , between the boers and the griqua in the philippolis district the proclamation was disallowed by the governor , sir george napier , who , nevertheless , maintained that the boer farmers remained british subjects after this episode the british negotiated their treaties with adam kok iii and moshoeshoe the majority of the boer farmers in kok 's territory sent a deputation to the british commissioner in natal , henry cloete , asking for equal treatment with the griquas , and expressing the desire to come under british protection under such terms the place purchased by captain ( afterwards major ) warden as the seat of his court was known as bloemfontein , and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal in 1846 major warden occupied winburg for a short time , and the relations between the boers and the british were in a continual state of tension he recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the griquas and basotho , and on 3 february 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring british sovereignty over the country between the orange and the vaal eastward to the drakensberg a nominated legislative council was created , a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country , which was officially styled the orange river sovereignty in 1851 moshoeshoe joined the republican party in the sovereignty in an invitation to pretorius to recross the vaal the intervention of pretorius resulted in the sand river convention of 1852 , which acknowledged the independence of the transvaal but left the status of the sovereignty untouched the british government ( under first russell ministry ) , which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country , had , however , already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the sovereignty at the close of that year a settlement was at length concluded with moshoeshoe , which left , perhaps , that chief in a stronger position than he had hitherto been at that time there were some 15,000 europeans in the country , many of them recent immigrants from cape colony the majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of british rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in london with the colonial secretary , the duke of newcastle , who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of british rule eventually , in 1861 , he sold his sovereign rights to the free state for £4000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as griqualand east the country was declared a republic and named the orange free state all persons of european blood possessing a six months ' residential qualification were to be granted full burgher rights the president was to be assisted by an executive council , was to hold office for five years and was eligible for re-election the first president was josias philip hoffman , but he was accused of being too complaisant towards moshoeshoe and resigned , being succeeded in 1855 by jacobus nicolaas boshoff , one of the voortrekkers , who had previously taken an active part in the affairs of the natalia republic . conflict with the south african republic marthinus pretorius , who had succeeded to his father 's position as commandant general of potchefstroom , wished to bring about a confederation between the two boer states the country lying to the north of the orange river and west of the caledon river , formerly a part of basutoland , was ceded to the orange free state , and became known as the conquered territory in spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the orange free state boers , living in the northern part of the country , went to the transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the british the renewal of the policy of british expansion had been answered by the formation of the afrikaner bond , which represented the aspirations of the afrikaner people , and had active branches in the free state a further offensive and defensive alliance between the two republics was then entered into , under which the orange free state took up arms on the outbreak of hostilities between the british and the south african republic in october 1899 for nearly two years longer the burghers kept the field under christiaan de wet and other leaders , but by the articles of peace signed on 31 may 1902 british sovereignty was acknowledged

europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century in 1824 farmers of dutch , huguenots and german descent known as voortrekkers ( later named boers by the english ) emerged from the cape colony , seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape british governmental oversight , settling in the country these emigrants left the cape colony for various reasons , but all shared the desire for independence from british authority reprisals followed , and in november 1837 the boers decisively defeated mzilikazi , who thereupon fled northward and eventually established himself on the site of the future bulawayo in zimbabwe these barolong had trekked from their original home under their chief , moroka ii , first south-westwards to the langberg , and then eastwards to thaba nchu dissensions speedily arose among the emigrants , whose numbers were constantly added to , and retief , potgieter and other leaders crossed the drakensberg and entered natal moshoeshoe , a minor basotho chief , had welded together a number of scattered and broken clans which had sought refuge in that mountainous region after fleeing from mzilikazi , and had formed the basotho nation which acknowledged him as king in 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of french protestant missionaries , and as the boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the british at the cape a similar treaty was made with the griqua chief adam kok iii by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule this fact induced mr justice menzies , one of the judges of the cape colony then on circuit at colesberg , to cross the orange and proclaim the country british territory in october 1842 the treaties gave great offence to the boers , who refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the native chiefs the place purchased by captain ( afterwards major ) warden as the seat of his court was known as bloemfontein , and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country bloemfontein lay to the south of the region settled by voortrekkers the volksraad at winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the boers living between the orange and the vaal and was in federation with the volksraad at potchefstroom , which made a similar claim upon the great boers living north of the vaal in 1846 major warden occupied winburg for a short time , and the relations between the boers and the british were in a continual state of tension he recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the griquas and basotho , and on 3 february 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring british sovereignty over the country between the orange and the vaal eastward to the drakensberg sir harry smith 's popularity among the boers gained for his policy considerable support , but the republican party , at whose head was andries pretorius , did not submit without a struggle the british resident had , however , no force sufficient to maintain his authority , and moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the europeans the intervention of pretorius resulted in the sand river convention of 1852 , which acknowledged the independence of the transvaal but left the status of the sovereignty untouched '' a meeting of representatives of all european inhabitants of the sovereignty , elected on manhood suffrage , held at bloemfontein in june 1852 , nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of british rule the majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of british rule provided that it was effective

the government to alter their decision , sir george clerk speedily came to terms with a committee formed by the republican party and presided over by mr j the colonial secretary added that it was impossible for england to supply troops to constantly advancing outposts , '' especially as cape town and the port of table bay were all she really required in south africa '' in withdrawing from the sovereignty the british government declared that it had '' no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the orange river with the exception of the griqua chief captain adam kok iii '' kok was not formidable in a military sense , nor could he prevent individual griquas from alienating their lands eventually , in 1861 , he sold his sovereign rights to the free state for Â£4000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as griqualand east on the abandonment of british rule , representatives of the people were elected and met at bloemfontein on 28 march 1854 , and between then and 18 april were engaged in framing a constitution the country was declared a republic and named the orange free state distracted among themselves , with the formidable basotho power on their southern and eastern flank , the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the transvaal boers of the south african republic the majority of the burghers rallied to his support , and on 25 may , the two opposing forces faced one another on the banks of the rhenoster president boshoff not only got together some 800 men within the orange free state , but he received offers of support from commandant stephanus schoeman , the transvaal leader in the zoutpansberg district and from commandant joubert of lydenburg '' several of the malcontents in the orange free state who had joined pretorius permanently settled in the transvaal , and other orange free staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished the difficulties of the state were at that time so great that the volksraad in december 1858 passed a resolution in favour of confederation with the cape colony this proposition received the strong support of sir george grey , the then governor of cape colony , but his view did not commend itself to the british government , and was not adopted in the same year , the disputes between the basotho and the boers culminated in open war at the time of the first annexation of the transvaal the free state declined lord carnarvon 's invitation to federate with the other south african communities the renewal of the policy of british expansion had been answered by the formation of the afrikaner bond , which represented the aspirations of the afrikaner people , and had active branches in the free state in january 1889 francis

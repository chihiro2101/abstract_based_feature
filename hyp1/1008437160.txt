europeans first visited the country north of the orange river towards the close of the 18th century the majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the sotho people ( colonial form basuto ) , but in the valleys of the orange and vaal were korana and other khoikhoi , and in the drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of bushmen up to this time the few europeans who had crossed the orange had come mainly as hunters or as missionaries these emigrants left the cape colony for various reasons , but all shared the desire for independence from british authority the boers soon came into collision with mzilikazi 's raiding parties , which attacked boer hunters who crossed the vaal river in the meantime another party of cape dutch emigrants had settled at thaba nchu , where the wesleyans had a mission station for the barolong these barolong had trekked from their original home under their chief , moroka ii , first south-westwards to the langberg , and then eastwards to thaba nchu by these treaties , which recognised native sovereignty over large areas on which boer farmers were settled , the british sought to keep a check on the boers and to protect both the natives and cape colony the year in which the treaty with moshoeshoe was made , several large parties of boers recrossed the drakensberg into the country north of the orange , refusing to remain in natal when the british annexed the newly formed boer republic of natalia to form the colony of natal trouble first arose , however , between the boers and the griqua in the philippolis district some of the boer farmers in this district , unlike their fellows dwelling farther north , were willing to accept british rule the majority of the boer farmers in kok 's territory sent a deputation to the british commissioner in natal , henry cloete , asking for equal treatment with the griquas , and expressing the desire to come under british protection under such terms the place purchased by captain ( afterwards major ) warden as the seat of his court was known as bloemfontein , and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country sir harry smith became governor of the cape at the end of 1847 sir harry smith 's popularity among the boers gained for his policy considerable support , but the republican party , at whose head was andries pretorius , did not submit without a struggle in october 1849 moshoeshoe was induced to sign a new arrangement considerably curtailing the boundaries of the basotho reserve the british resident had , however , no force sufficient to maintain his authority , and moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the europeans the intervention of pretorius resulted in the sand river convention of 1852 , which acknowledged the independence of the transvaal but left the status of the sovereignty untouched '' a meeting of representatives of all european inhabitants of the sovereignty , elected on manhood suffrage , held at bloemfontein in june 1852 , nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of british rule there had been ministerial changes in england and the aberdeen ministry , then in power , adhered to the determination to withdraw from the sovereignty at that time there were some 15,000 europeans in the country , many of them recent immigrants from cape colony sir george clerk announced that , as the elected delegates were unwilling to take steps to form an independent government , he would enter into negotiations with other persons even before this committee met a royal proclamation had been signed ( 30 january 1854 ) '' abandoning and renouncing all dominion '' in the sovereignty the orange river convention , recognising the independence of the country , was signed at bloemfontein on 23 february by sir george clerk and the republican committee , and in march the boer government assumed office and the republican flag was hoisted '' in withdrawing from the sovereignty the british government declared that it had '' no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the orange river with the exception of the griqua chief captain adam kok iii '' kok was not formidable in a military sense , nor could he prevent individual griquas from alienating their lands the country was declared a republic and named the orange free state distracted among themselves , with the formidable basotho power on their southern and eastern flank , the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the transvaal boers of the south african republic marthinus pretorius , who had succeeded to his father 's position as commandant general of potchefstroom , wished to bring about a confederation between the two boer states on learning of the invasion , president jacobus nicolaas boshoff proclaimed martial law throughout the country the majority of the burghers rallied to his support , and on 25 may , the two opposing forces faced one another on the banks of the rhenoster pretorius and kruger , realising that they would have to sustain attack from both north and south , abandoned their enterprise '' several of the malcontents in the orange free state who had joined pretorius permanently settled in the transvaal , and other orange free staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished this experience did not , however , heal the party strife within the orange free state the difficulties of the state were at that time so great that the volksraad in december 1858 passed a resolution in favour of confederation with the cape colony this proposition received the strong support of sir george grey , the then governor of cape colony , but his view did not commend itself to the british government , and was not adopted in the same year , the disputes between the basotho and the boers culminated in open war the intervention of the governor of cape colony led to the conclusion of the treaty of aliwal north ( 12 february 1869 ) , which defined the borders between the orange free state and basutoland the country lying to the north of the orange river and west of the caledon river , formerly a part of basutoland , was ceded to the orange free state , and became known as the conquered territory the relations between the british and the orange free state , after the question of the boundary was settled , remained perfectly amicable down to the outbreak of the second boer war in 1899 in 1889 an agreement made between the orange free state and the cape colony government , whereby the latter was empowered to extend , at its own cost , its railway system to bloemfontein a further offensive and defensive alliance between the two republics was then entered into , under which the orange free state took up arms on the outbreak of hostilities between the british and the south african republic in october 1899 national anthem of the orange free state (

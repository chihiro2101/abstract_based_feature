a new fundamental force might be difficult to test gravity , for example , is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass a new ( or '' fifth '' ) fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect nonetheless , in the late 1980s a fifth force , operating on municipal scales ( i.e – the leading group searching for a fifth force alternative theories of gravity , such as brans–dicke theory , have a fifth force – possibly with infinite range the fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits , called the nordtvedt effect , which is set to test for a fifth force in space , where it is possible to achieve greater sensitivity they concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre this would change the gravity force to a non-local force the force may explain the g−2 muon anomaly and provide a dark matter candidate

a new fundamental force might be difficult to test gravity , for example , is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass a new ( or '' fifth '' ) fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect nonetheless , in the late 1980s a fifth force , operating on municipal scales ( i.e there are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken , which depend on the kind of force being considered , and its range one way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle : this is one of the most powerful tests of einstein 's theory of gravity : general relativity alternative theories of gravity , such as brans–dicke theory , have a fifth force – possibly with infinite range another kind of fifth force , which arises in kaluza–klein theory , where the universe has extra dimensions , or in supergravity or string theory is the yukawa force , which is transmitted by a light scalar field ( i.e they concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses several research experiments are underway to attempt to validate or refute these results

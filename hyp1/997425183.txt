gravity , for example , is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass a new ( or '' fifth '' ) fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect nonetheless , in the late 1980s a fifth force , operating on municipal scales ( i.e one way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle : this is one of the most powerful tests of einstein 's theory of gravity : general relativity alternative theories of gravity , such as brans–dicke theory , have a fifth force – possibly with infinite range another kind of fifth force , which arises in kaluza–klein theory , where the universe has extra dimensions , or in supergravity or string theory is the yukawa force , which is transmitted by a light scalar field ( i.e they concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre theory suggests that the rate of cepheid pulsation in galaxies screened from a hypothetical fifth force by neighbouring clusters , would follow a different pattern from cepheids that are not screened a comprehensive review by ephraim fischbach and carrick talmadge suggested there is no compelling evidence for the fifth force , though scientists still search for it the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses this was reported through science journalism , focusing largely on the implications that the existence of the x17 particle and a corresponding fifth force would have in the search for dark matter

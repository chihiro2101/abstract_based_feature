a new fundamental force might be difficult to test gravity , for example , is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass a new ( or '' fifth '' ) fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect one way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle : this is one of the most powerful tests of einstein 's theory of gravity : general relativity alternative theories of gravity , such as brans–dicke theory , have a fifth force – possibly with infinite range this is because gravitational interactions , in theories other than general relativity , have degrees of freedom other than the '' metric '' , which dictates the curvature of space , and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects another kind of fifth force , which arises in kaluza–klein theory , where the universe has extra dimensions , or in supergravity or string theory is the yukawa force , which is transmitted by a light scalar field ( i.e this requires extremely sensitive experiments which search for a deviation from the inverse-square law of gravity over a range of distances the above experiments search for a fifth force that is , like gravity , independent of the composition of an object , so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses the force may explain the g−2 muon anomaly and provide a dark matter candidate this was reported through science journalism , focusing largely on the implications that the existence of the x17 particle and a corresponding fifth force would have in the search for dark matter

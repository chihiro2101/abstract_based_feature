the smoke plume becomes turbulent as its reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale to prevent this , the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote turbulence this results in higher skin friction , but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along , resulting in lower drag as the flow emerges into this external fluid , shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events a turbulent event is a series of turbulent fluctuations that contain more energy than the average flow turbulence in the medical field of cardiology , a stethoscope is used to detect heart sounds and bruits , which are due to turbulent blood flow turbulence is characterized by the following features : ; irregularity : turbulent flows are always highly irregular turbulent flow is chaotic however , not all chaotic flows are turbulent in addition , the turbulent diffusivity concept assumes a constitutive relation between a turbulent flux and the gradient of a mean variable similar to the relation between flux and gradient that exists for molecular transport nevertheless , the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows , and many models have been postulated to calculate it in fluid dynamics , they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching directionâ€”due to the conservation of angular momentum via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow

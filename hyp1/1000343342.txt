the smoke plume becomes turbulent as its reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale ) if the golf ball were smooth , the boundary layer flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions to prevent this , the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote turbulence this results in higher skin friction , but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along , resulting in lower drag as the flow emerges into this external fluid , shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence snow fences work by inducing turbulence in the wind , forcing it to drop much of its snow load near the fence when the flow is faster , a higher reynolds number is associated with the flow in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events a turbulent event is a series of turbulent fluctuations that contain more energy than the average flow turbulence ; diffusivity : the readily available supply of energy in turbulent flows tends to accelerate the homogenization ( mixing ) of fluid mixtures this turbulent diffusion coefficient is defined in a phenomenological sense , by analogy with the molecular diffusivities , but it does not have a true physical meaning , being dependent on the flow conditions , and not a property of the fluid itself in general , the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements ; dissipation : to sustain turbulent flow , a persistent source of energy supply is required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow

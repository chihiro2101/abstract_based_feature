the smoke plume becomes turbulent as its reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale ) if the golf ball were smooth , the boundary layer flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions clear-air turbulence experienced during airplane flight , as well as poor astronomical seeing ( the blurring of images seen through the atmosphere ) a jet exhausting from a nozzle into a quiescent fluid as the flow emerges into this external fluid , shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence when the flow is faster , a higher reynolds number is associated with the flow in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events in normal individuals , heart sounds are a product of turbulent flow as heart valves close however , in some conditions turbulent flow can be audible due to other reasons , some of them pathological turbulence is characterized by the following features : ; irregularity : turbulent flows are always highly irregular for this reason , turbulence problems are normally treated statistically rather than deterministically turbulent flow is chaotic via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow this behavior , and the lack of universality of the constants , are related with the phenomenon of intermittency in turbulence

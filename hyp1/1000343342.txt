flow over a golf ball ) if the golf ball were smooth , the boundary layer flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions to prevent this , the surface is dimpled to perturb the boundary layer and promote turbulence the oceanic and atmospheric mixed layers and intense oceanic currents as the flow emerges into this external fluid , shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence biologically generated turbulence resulting from swimming animals affects ocean mixing snow fences work by inducing turbulence in the wind , forcing it to drop much of its snow load near the fence the flow may start off laminar but is quickly separated from the leg and becomes turbulent in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events a turbulent event is a series of turbulent fluctuations that contain more energy than the average flow turbulence however , not all chaotic flows are turbulent the process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid 's molecular viscosity into heat via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow thus the '' kolmogorov âˆ’ spectrum '' is generally observed in turbulence

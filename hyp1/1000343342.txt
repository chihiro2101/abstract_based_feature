the smoke plume becomes turbulent as its reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale ) if the golf ball were smooth , the boundary layer flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions this results in higher skin friction , but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along , resulting in lower drag as the flow emerges into this external fluid , shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created when river flow is slow , water flows smoothly around the support legs when the flow is faster , a higher reynolds number is associated with the flow in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events a turbulent event is a series of turbulent fluctuations that contain more energy than the average flow turbulence in the medical field of cardiology , a stethoscope is used to detect heart sounds and bruits , which are due to turbulent blood flow however , in some conditions turbulent flow can be audible due to other reasons , some of them pathological ; diffusivity : the readily available supply of energy in turbulent flows tends to accelerate the homogenization ( mixing ) of fluid mixtures turbulent diffusion is usually described by a turbulent diffusion coefficient on the other hand , vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the turbulence energy cascade relies to establish and maintain identifiable structure function as a result , the radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow structures break down into smaller structures via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow

the smoke plume becomes turbulent as its reynolds number increases with increases in flow velocity and characteristic lengthscale flow over a golf ball ) if the golf ball were smooth , the boundary layer flow over the front of the sphere would be laminar at typical conditions this results in higher skin friction , but it moves the point of boundary layer separation further along , resulting in lower drag clear-air turbulence experienced during airplane flight , as well as poor astronomical seeing ( the blurring of images seen through the atmosphere ) as the flow emerges into this external fluid , shear layers originating at the lips of the nozzle are created these layers separate the fast moving jet from the external fluid , and at a certain critical reynolds number they become unstable and break down to turbulence the flow may start off laminar but is quickly separated from the leg and becomes turbulent in many geophysical flows ( rivers , atmospheric boundary layer ) , the flow turbulence is dominated by the coherent structures and turbulent events however , in some conditions turbulent flow can be audible due to other reasons , some of them pathological ; diffusivity : the readily available supply of energy in turbulent flows tends to accelerate the homogenization ( mixing ) of fluid mixtures nevertheless , the turbulent diffusivity is the simplest approach for quantitative analysis of turbulent flows , and many models have been postulated to calculate it the process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid 's molecular viscosity into heat ; dissipation : to sustain turbulent flow , a persistent source of energy supply is required because turbulence dissipates rapidly as the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy by viscous shear stress via this energy cascade , turbulent flow can be realized as a superposition of a spectrum of flow velocity fluctuations and eddies upon a mean flow

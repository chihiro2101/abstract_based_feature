he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light these results suggested that either gravity does not apply universally or that , conservatively , upwards of 50 % of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge the material responsible for the extra mass was dubbed dark matter , the existence of which was first posited in the 1930s by jan oort in his measurements of the oort constants and fritz zwicky in his studies of the masses of galaxy clusters in order to accommodate a flat rotation curve , a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated newton 's version of kepler 's third law implies that the spherically symmetric , radial density profile is : : \rho ( r ) \frac with the galaxy gravitational potential a consistent way to predict the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is to measure its bolometric luminosity and then read its rotation rate from its location on the tullyâ€“fisher diagram thus the magnitude of the galaxy rotation is related to the galaxy 's visible mass there have been a number of attempts to solve the problem of galaxy rotation by modifying gravity without invoking dark matter using data from the spitzer photometry and accurate rotation curves ( sparc ) database , a group has found the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution ( that is , including stars and gas but not dark matter ) . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter

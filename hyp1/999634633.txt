in 1932 , jan oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed , but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous in 1939 , horace babcock reported in his phd thesis measurements of the rotation curve for andromeda which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially he attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light in 1959 , louise volders used the same telescope to demonstrate that the spiral galaxy m33 also does not spin as expected according to keplerian dynamics reporting on ngc 3115 , jan oort wrote that '' the distribution of mass in the system appears to bear almost no relation to that of light it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge in order to accommodate a flat rotation curve , a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of kepler 's laws , they do not match the distribution of luminous matter a popular interpretation of these observations is that about 26 % of the mass of the universe is composed of dark matter , a hypothesis type of matter which does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation thus the magnitude of the galaxy rotation is related to the galaxy 's visible mass very importantly , the analysis of the inner parts of low and high surface brightness galaxies showed that the shape of the rotation curves in the centre of dark-matter dominated systems indicates a profile different from the nfw spatial mass distribution profile

in 1932 , jan oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed , but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous a companion paper by maarten schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light together with fellow staff-member kent ford , rubin announced at a 1975 meeting of the american astronomical society the discovery that most stars in spiral galaxies orbit at roughly the same speed , and that this implied that galaxy masses grow approximately linearly with radius well beyond the location of most of the stars ( the galactic bulge ) these results suggested that either gravity does not apply universally or that , conservatively , upwards of 50 % of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo if newtonian mechanics is assumed to be correct , it would follow that most of the mass of the galaxy had to be in the galactic bulge near the center and that the stars and gas in the disk portion should orbit the center at decreasing velocities with radial distance from the galactic center ( the dashed line in fig it is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge , and most low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) have the same anomalous rotation curve the rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge the material responsible for the extra mass was dubbed dark matter , the existence of which was first posited in the 1930s by jan oort in his measurements of the oort constants and fritz zwicky in his studies of the masses of galaxy clusters since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of kepler 's laws , they do not match the distribution of luminous matter dark matter is believed to dominate the gravitational potential of galaxies and clusters of galaxies additionally , detailed investigations of the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxy ( lsb galaxies ) in the 1990s and of their position on the tully–fisher relation showed that lsb galaxies had to have dark matter haloes that are more extended and less dense than those of hsb galaxies and thus surface brightness is related to the halo properties mond has had a considerable amount of success in predicting the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxies , matching the baryonic tully–fisher relation , and the velocity dispersions of the small satellite galaxies of the local group . a model of galaxy based on a general relativity metric was also proposed , showing that the rotation curves for the milky way , ngc 3031 , ngc 3198 and ngc 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter , avoiding the need for a massive halo of exotic dark matter

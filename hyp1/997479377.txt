earthshine is visible earthlight reflected from the moon 's night side it is also known as the moon 's ashen glow or as '' the new moon with the old moon in her arm '' in the scots ballad of sir patrick spens earthshine is most readily visible from a few nights before until a few nights after a new moon , during the ( waxing or waning ) crescent phase when the lunar phase is new as viewed from earth , earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the moon sunlight is reflected from earth to the night side of the moon light is reflected from earth to the moon and back to earth as earthshine land reflects 10â€“25 % of sunlight , and clouds reflect around 50 % thus , the part of earth where it is daytime and from where the moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the moon appears at any given time for example , when its phase is full , the moon reflects light preferentially toward the sun and also earth , which is in almost the same direction ringshine is when sunlight is reflected by a planet 's ring system onto the planet or onto the moons of the planet while terrestrial planet finder-c aims to study the light of extrasolar planets , darwin and terrestrial planet finder-i will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated ( rather than scattered ) by the planet

earthshine is visible earthlight reflected from the moon 's night side when the lunar phase is new as viewed from earth , earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the moon sunlight is reflected from earth to the night side of the moon leonardo da vinci explained the phenomenon in the early 16th century when he realized that both earth and the moon reflect sunlight at the same time light is reflected from earth to the moon and back to earth as earthshine thus , the part of earth where it is daytime and from where the moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the moon appears at any given time for example , when its phase is full , the moon reflects light preferentially toward the sun and also earth , which is in almost the same direction scientists at nasa 's navigator program , which specializes in the detection of terrestrial planets , have backed the launch of a terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) mission for this reason , darwin and terrestrial planet finder-i will work in the thermal infrared while terrestrial planet finder-c aims to study the light of extrasolar planets , darwin and terrestrial planet finder-i will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated ( rather than scattered ) by the planet the detection of a similar spectral feature in light from an extrasolar planet would be particularly interesting , since it might be due to a light-harvesting organism

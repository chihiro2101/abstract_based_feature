earthshine is visible earthlight reflected from the moon 's night side it is also known as the moon 's ashen glow or as '' the new moon with the old moon in her arm '' when the lunar phase is new as viewed from earth , earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the moon sunlight is reflected from earth to the night side of the moon leonardo da vinci explained the phenomenon in the early 16th century when he realized that both earth and the moon reflect sunlight at the same time light is reflected from earth to the moon and back to earth as earthshine thus , the part of earth where it is daytime and from where the moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the moon appears at any given time studies of earthshine can be used to show how the earth 's cloud cover varies over time for example , when its phase is full , the moon reflects light preferentially toward the sun and also earth , which is in almost the same direction ringshine is when sunlight is reflected by a planet 's ring system onto the planet or onto the moons of the planet for a terrestrial planet , the contrast ratio of planet to its host stars is approximately ~10 −6 -10 −7 in the thermal infrared or ~10 −9 -10 −10 in the optical/near infrared

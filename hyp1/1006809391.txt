according to british dictionaries , '' sweater '' is used in british english in the same sense as in american english but '' jumper '' is commonly used instead ( though some say that '' sweater '' is used for heavier ones worn for warmth ) jumper in the macmillan dictionary : '' british a warm piece of clothing , usually made of wool , that you pull over your head and that covers your upper body and arms '' the oed gives '' sweater '' as appearing in 1882 and gives its definition as '' a woolen vest or jersey worn in rowing or other athletic exercises , originally hence a similar garment for general informal wear ; a jumper or pullover '' according to most british dictionaries , british usage agrees with what american dictionaries describe as american english usage , according to which a sweater is either a pullover or a cardigan ( which opens at the front ) almost all british dictionaries include cardigans as a type of sweater but at least one includes cardigans as a type of jumper ( i.e most british dictionaries consider '' sweater '' – and at least one considers '' jumper '' – to be a hypernym for both pullovers and cardigans ) although the term often refers to a pullover , it can also refer to a cardigan , a garment that opens and fastens down the front sweaters that are more tightly fitted or have a soft drape may conform well to the body without requiring tailoring necessary in a woven garment such as darts , flares , and gores in british english , a sweater may also be called a pullover , jumper , or jersey if sleeveless , such a garment may be called a '' slipover '' or '' tank top '' in british english , while '' tank top '' in us english refers to a sleeveless shirt in south african english , a knitted sweater is always called a jersey , while sweater , when used , refers to a sweatshirt in the sport of ice hockey , the top of a hockey player 's uniform had traditionally been a sweater ; and even though modern hockey uniform tops are more commonly a jersey they are typically referred to as a '' hockey sweater , '' regardless of the style , but frequently , in the u.s sweaters can be worn with a dress shirt underneath ( and optionally a tie ) , which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations in the late 20th century , the sweater increasingly came to be worn as an alternative to a shirt when finer materials made them more comfortable next to the skin but airing ( and rinsing in pure water if necessary ) is considered better than washing with soap or another detergent , especially when not all of the natural oil ( lanolin ) has been removed from the wool

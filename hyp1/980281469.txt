the new orleans rhythm kings in its earliest stages was the creation of the drummer mike '' ragbaby '' stevens , solely in that he sent the first telegram to albert brunies about going to chicago to form a band and find better gigs than new orleans had to offer albert '' abbie '' brunies and his younger brother , the trombonist george brunies , were initially hesitant but suggested the idea to a friend , the trumpet player paul mares , who immediately took the opportunity george brunies packed his trombone and set off to join mares in chicago , playing gigs and going to after-hours clubs with mares the name '' new orleans rhythm kings '' did not initially refer to this group but rather was the name of a group under the direction of bee palmer , a vaudeville performer palmer 's group did not last , but within several months of the breakup of the band , a member of the group , the clarinetist leon roppolo , was playing on riverboats in chicago with elmer schoebel , jack pettis , frank snyder , george brunies , the banjoist louis black and ( possibly ) paul mares the bassist arnold loyocano joined forces with the growing band , and thus began the group 's engagement at the friar 's inn , which lasted 17 months beginning in 1921 '' new orleans rhythm kings while at the friar 's inn , the group attracted the interest not only of fans but of other musicians they re-formed periodically to make recordings , with significant member turnover ( roppolo and mares were more or less the leaders and constants of the group ) , but the group never played all together again they went their separate ways : paul mares continued to play music , releasing a record in 1935 and ran the p & m new orleans barbeque with his wife in the late 1930s jelly roll , bix , and hoagy : gennett studios and the birth of recorded jazz paul mares scheduled another two-day recording session at gennett later , but the band had recently dissolved somewhat , moving in different directions following their stint at the friar 's inn for the session mares got brunies , roppolo , stitzel , and pollack together to release a record as the new orleans rhythm kings , the first time the name had been used since it had referred to bee palmer 's travelling vaudeville act the third recording session occurred after mares and roppolo had spent some time playing in a small band in new york city they returned to chicago and scheduled another session with gennett records as the new orleans rhythm kings mares and roppolo went on to conduct two more recording sessions in new orleans as the new orleans rhythm kings in 1925 before the group dissolved altogether and its members went their separate ways the very first jazz bands were mostly black and played for black audiences , though the genre progressively got picked up by white audiences too despite a significant bias that only black musicians could play '' real '' jazz , white bands such as the new orleans rhythm kings and the original dixieland jazz band emerged and were successful , especially in their recordings

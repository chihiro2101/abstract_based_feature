the word catacombs comes from the latin root word catatumbas meaning either “ among the tombs ” or , according to other translations from the original late latin , “ next to the quarry ” the later translation stems from the first excavations done to create the catacombs system , which was conducted outside of rome near the quarry “ catacombs of rome – useful information – rome & vatican museums ” from about the 2nd century ad , inhumation ( burial of unburnt human remains ) became customary , either in graves or , for those who could afford them , in sarcophagi , often elaborately carved by the 4th century , burial had overtaken cremation as the usual practice , and the construction of tombs had grown greater and spread throughout the empire considerable tracts of the ancient roads leading out of rome and other roman cities , like the via appia to this day , had monumental tombs running alongside them despite widespread popular modern ideas , these tunnels were probably not used for regular worship at first , but simply for burial names of the catacombs – like st calixtus and st sebastian , which is alongside via appia – refer to martyrs that may have been buried there however , about 80 % of the excavations used for christian burials date to after the time of the persecutions sample d9-w-xvi-8 , considered to be a two-year-old child , shows that children in ancient rome were breastfed and this child , in particular , had not yet been weaned off its mother roman law forbade burial places within city limits and so all burial places , including the catacombs , were located outside the walls of the city they were carved in tufa , a type of volcanic rock which is relatively soft to dig into but subsequently hardens , christian catacombs existed as a burial ground for early christians accompanied by inscriptions and early wall art although catacombs were of jewish origin in the first century , by the end of the sixth century there were over 60 christian catacombs these catacombs served as a connector for various christian communities through the underlying concepts of socio-economic status shown within the art christian art in the catacombs is split into three categories : iconographic , stylistic , and technical from the first to the sixth century , the art in roman christian catacombs progressively went into phases as well : an early phase , an old testament phase , and a new testament phase the fresco decorations provide the main surviving evidence for early christian art , and initially show typically roman styles used for decorating homes – with secular iconography adapted to a religious function the complex system of tunnels that would later be known as the catacombs were first excavated by the etruscan people that lived in the region predating the romans these quarries became the basis for later excavation , first by the romans for rock resources and then by the christians and jews for burial sites and mass graves however , the practice of catacomb burial declined slowly , and the dead were increasingly buried in church cemeteries in the 6th century catacombs were used only for martyrs ’ memorial services , though some paintings were added as late as the 7th century , for example a saint stephen in the catacomb of commodilla archeologist giovanni battista de rossi ( 1822–1894 ) published the first extensive professional studies about catacombs roman catacombs are made up of underground passages ( ambulacra ) , in the walls of which horizontal niches ( loculi ) were dug close to the catacombs of san callisto are the large and impressive catacombs of domitilla catacombs of domitilla ( named after saint domitilla ) , spread over of caves these catacombs , on the via ostiensis , contain one of the earliest images of a bearded christ they consist of a vast underground burial area , at first in pagan then in christian use , housing various tombs of christian martyrs agnes ' bones are now conserved in the church of sant'agnese fuori le mura in rome , built over the catacomb on the via salaria , the catacombs of via anapo are datable to the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th century , and contain diverse frescoes of biblical subjects 1575-1576–1629 ) was an italian scholar , the first systematic explorer of subterranean rome catacomb saints , corpses from the roman catacombs that were decorated and presented as relics of christian saints depictions of jesus list of ancient monuments in rome

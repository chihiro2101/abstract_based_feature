the oath was included in article 17 of the irish free state 's 1922 constitution it read : the words '' allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state '' were taken from de valera 's preferred version , which read : '' i ( name ) do solemnly swear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of the irish free state , to the treaty of association , and to recognise the king of great britain as head of associated states ironically , in view of the opposition expressed to the oath by anti-treatyites , it was in fact largely the work of michael collins , based in its open lines on a draft oath suggested by the president of dáil éireann , éamon de valera , and also on the oath of the irish republican brotherhood in fact , collins cleared the oath with the irb before proposing it during the treaty negotiations 234 by the standards of the oaths of allegiance to be found in other british commonwealth dominions , it was quite mild , with no direct personal oath to the monarch , only an indirect oath of fidelity by virtue of the king 's role in the treaty settlement as '' king in ireland '' , a figurehead position in their view : the oath was an acceptance of a common citizenship between ireland and britain under king george and therefore was in total contravention to the oath to the irish republic which they had previously taken dáil éireann – volume 3–19 december 1921 debate on treaty they rebutted the argument that it was simply an oath to the constitution by pointing out that the constitution itself made the king head of state and it was therefore the same as an oath of allegiance to him directly the fidelity to the king was not to him as british monarch but '' in virtue of the common citizenship of ireland with great britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the british commonwealth of nations '' , in other words , in his role as the symbol of the treaty settlement , not as british king in 1933 , de valera amended the free state 's constitution at the time , amendable by simple majority in the dáil , firstly to allow him to introduce any constitutional amendments irrespective of whether they clashed with the anglo-irish treaty , then amended the constitution to remove article 17 of the constitution which required the taking of the oath the confederate oath of association was an oath of loyalty to charles i of england , made at a time when the jurors were mostly engaged in a war with the royal '' english army for ireland '' , this oath of allegiance remains required before elected members of the house of commons may take their seats and is one of the reasons for the abstentionism policy of sinn féin and other nationalists throughout history

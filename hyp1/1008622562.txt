there are five hurdle heights on most standard hurdles the highest position ( sometimes '' college high '' or '' open high '' ) is used for men 's sprint hurdle races ( 60 m , and 110 m ) , which are the middle position of 36 inches ( 91.44 & nbsp ; cm ) , ( sometimes '' intermediate '' ) which is used for men 's long hurdle races ( 400 m ) plus some youth and veteran age divisions the lowest position , called the '' low hurdle '' is used for women 's long hurdles plus many youth and veteran races in sprint hurdle races for men , regardless of the length of the race , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is in sprint hurdle races for women , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is in long hurdle events , whether for men or women , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is most races which are shorter than the standard distance ( such as indoor races ) are simply run over fewer hurdles but use the same distances from the starting line when approaching the first hurdle , athletes try to avoid stutter stepping ( a term used to refer to the cutting of stride length before reaching a hurdle ) athletes attack the hurdle by launching at it from 6–7 feet away ( depending on runner 's closing speed ) ; the lead leg extended yet slightly bent ( because a straight leg leads to more time over the hurdle ) so that the heel just narrowly clears the barrier 's height this involves the correct use of the lead leg , trail leg , and arm positions upon crossing over the hurdle barrier , the runner 's lead leg snaps down quickly landing roughly beyond the hurdle in the 100 and 110 meter hurdle events , the fastest hurdlers use the three-step technique however , pushing the hurdle with one 's hands or running out of one 's lane as a result of hitting the hurdle is cause for disqualification the standard races correspond to the standard sprint hurdle races : 4 × 110 m for men and 4 × 100 m for women shuttle hurdle relay was introduced at the 2019 iaaf world relays , it consist of a race in which two men and two women on each team are running a 110 m hurdles

there are five hurdle heights on most standard hurdles the highest position ( sometimes '' college high '' or '' open high '' ) is used for men 's sprint hurdle races ( 60 m , and 110 m ) , which are the middle position of 36 inches ( 91.44 & nbsp ; cm ) , ( sometimes '' intermediate '' ) which is used for men 's long hurdle races ( 400 m ) plus some youth and veteran age divisions the next lower position , is called the '' women 's high '' used for women 's short hurdle races the lowest position , called the '' low hurdle '' is used for women 's long hurdles plus many youth and veteran races in sprint hurdle races for men , regardless of the length of the race , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is in sprint hurdle races for women , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is in long hurdle events , whether for men or women , the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is generally , the efficient hurdler spends the minimum amount of time and energy going vertically over the hurdle , thus achieving maximum speed in the horizontal race direction down the track this involves the correct use of the lead leg , trail leg , and arm positions upon crossing over the hurdle barrier , the runner 's lead leg snaps down quickly landing roughly beyond the hurdle an effective trail leg will be parallel to the top of the hurdle and will be as close to the top of the hurdle as possible when three- or five-stepping , a hurdler will use the same lead leg for all of the hurdles there are now specifications for the tipping weight of a hurdle ( the weights need to be adjusted to correspond with the height of the hurdle ) so hitting a hurdle theoretically slows down the rhythm of the hurdler some coaches suggest if you lightly '' kiss '' the hurdle with the side of the leg closest to the hurdle , it can help with the runners speed by keeping the runner closer to the ground there are also shuttle hurdle relay races , although they are rarely run

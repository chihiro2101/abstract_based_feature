in each dimension , munsell colors are as close to perceptually uniform as he could make them , which makes the resulting shape quite irregular in practice , color charts conventionally specify 40 hues , in increments of 2.5 , progressing as for example 10r to 2.5yr value , or lightness , varies vertically along the color solid , from black ( value 0 ) at the bottom , to white ( value 10 ) at the top several color solids before munsell 's plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top , with a gray gradient between them , but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices 3 note that there is no intrinsic upper limit to chroma a color is fully specified by listing the three numbers for hue , value , and chroma in that order furthermore , none was based on any rigorous scientific measurement of human vision ; before munsell , the relationship between hue , value , and chroma was not understood beer color is measured in degrees lovibond , a metric based on the munsell system the original munsell color chart remains useful for comparing computer models of human color vision one of the first books about the munsell color system , explaining the intuition behind its three dimensions , and suggesting possible uses of the system in picking color combinations munsell.com , the homepage of munsell color , a subdivision of x-rite , current owners of the munsell color company munsell color palette , an online munsell color palette and munsell-to-srgb converter

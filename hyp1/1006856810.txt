in each dimension , munsell colors are as close to perceptually uniform as he could make them , which makes the resulting shape quite irregular value , or lightness , varies vertically along the color solid , from black ( value 0 ) at the bottom , to white ( value 10 ) at the top several color solids before munsell 's plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top , with a gray gradient between them , but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices for instance light yellow colors have considerably more potential chroma than light purples , due to the nature of the eye and the physics of color stimuli a color is fully specified by listing the three numbers for hue , value , and chroma in that order for instance , a purple of medium lightness and fairly saturated would be 5p 5/10 with 5p meaning the color in the middle of the purple hue band , 5/ meaning medium value ( lightness ) , and a chroma of 10 ( see swatch ) one of the first books about the munsell color system , explaining the intuition behind its three dimensions , and suggesting possible uses of the system in picking color combinations applepainter.com , a site explaining the munsell color chart , including an edited version of cleland 's book , a practical description of the munsell color system retrieved 13 august 2003 a brief explanation at the site of the japanese company dainichiseika color & chemicals , including a nice diagram of the munsell color solid munsell color palette , an online munsell color palette and munsell-to-srgb converter patternfly , a gpl and free color system logiteasy provides free online munsell color calculator for soil :

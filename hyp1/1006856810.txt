in practice , color charts conventionally specify 40 hues , in increments of 2.5 , progressing as for example 10r to 2.5yr two colors of equal value and chroma , on opposite sides of a hue circle , are complementary colors , and mix additively to the neutral gray of the same value value , or lightness , varies vertically along the color solid , from black ( value 0 ) at the bottom , to white ( value 10 ) at the top several color solids before munsell 's plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top , with a gray gradient between them , but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices chroma , measured radially from the center of each slice , represents the “ purity ” of a color ( related to saturation ) , with lower chroma being less pure ( more washed out , as in pastels ) different areas of the color space have different maximal chroma coordinates 20–21 albert munsell , an artist and professor of art at the massachusetts normal art school ( now massachusetts college of art and design , or massart ) , wanted to create a '' rational way to describe color '' that would use decimal notation instead of color names ( which he felt were '' foolish '' and '' misleading '' ) , , ch.1 , pg beer color is measured in degrees lovibond , a metric based on the munsell system the original munsell color chart remains useful for comparing computer models of human color vision an edited version can be found at a description of color systems leading up to munsell 's , and a biographical explanation of munsell 's changing ideas about color and development of his color solid , leading up to the publication of a color notation in 1905 a concise introduction to the munsell color system , on a web page which also discusses several other color systems , putting the munsell system in its historical context applepainter.com , a site explaining the munsell color chart , including an edited version of cleland 's book , a practical description of the munsell color system

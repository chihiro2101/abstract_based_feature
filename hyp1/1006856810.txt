in each dimension , munsell colors are as close to perceptually uniform as he could make them , which makes the resulting shape quite irregular two colors of equal value and chroma , on opposite sides of a hue circle , are complementary colors , and mix additively to the neutral gray of the same value value , or lightness , varies vertically along the color solid , from black ( value 0 ) at the bottom , to white ( value 10 ) at the top several color solids before munsell 's plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top , with a gray gradient between them , but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices the idea of using a three-dimensional color solid to represent all colors was developed during the 18th and 19th centuries these systems became progressively more sophisticated , with kirschmann â€™ s even recognizing the difference in value between bright colors of different hues he first started work on the system in 1898 and published it in full form in a color notation in 1905 the original embodiment of the system ( the 1905 atlas ) had some deficiencies as a physical representation of the theoretical system beer color is measured in degrees lovibond , a metric based on the munsell system the original munsell color chart remains useful for comparing computer models of human color vision an edited version can be found at a description of color systems leading up to munsell 's , and a biographical explanation of munsell 's changing ideas about color and development of his color solid , leading up to the publication of a color notation in 1905 applepainter.com , a site explaining the munsell color chart , including an edited version of cleland 's book , a practical description of the munsell color system

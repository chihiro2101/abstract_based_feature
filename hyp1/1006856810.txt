each horizontal circle munsell divided into five principal hues : red , yellow , green , blue , and purple , along with 5 intermediate hues ( e.g 1 each of these 10 steps , with the named hue given number 5 , is then broken into 10 sub-steps , so that 100 hues are given integer values two colors of equal value and chroma , on opposite sides of a hue circle , are complementary colors , and mix additively to the neutral gray of the same value the diagram below shows 40 evenly spaced munsell hues , with complements vertically aligned value , or lightness , varies vertically along the color solid , from black ( value 0 ) at the bottom , to white ( value 10 ) at the top several color solids before munsell 's plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top , with a gray gradient between them , but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices for instance light yellow colors have considerably more potential chroma than light purples , due to the nature of the eye and the physics of color stimuli an edited version can be found at a description of color systems leading up to munsell 's , and a biographical explanation of munsell 's changing ideas about color and development of his color solid , leading up to the publication of a color notation in 1905 a color notation was published before he had established the irregular shape of a perceptual color solid , so it describes colors positioned in a sphere applepainter.com , a site explaining the munsell color chart , including an edited version of cleland 's book , a practical description of the munsell color system patternfly , a gpl and free color system logiteasy provides free online munsell color calculator for soil :

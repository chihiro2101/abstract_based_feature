in each dimension , munsell colors are as close to perceptually uniform as he could make them , which makes the resulting shape quite irregular in practice , color charts conventionally specify 40 hues , in increments of 2.5 , progressing as for example 10r to 2.5yr two colors of equal value and chroma , on opposite sides of a hue circle , are complementary colors , and mix additively to the neutral gray of the same value value , or lightness , varies vertically along the color solid , from black ( value 0 ) at the bottom , to white ( value 10 ) at the top several color solids before munsell 's plotted luminosity from black on the bottom to white on the top , with a gray gradient between them , but these systems neglected to keep perceptual lightness constant across horizontal slices different areas of the color space have different maximal chroma coordinates the idea of using a three-dimensional color solid to represent all colors was developed during the 18th and 19th centuries these were improved significantly in the 1929 munsell book of color and through an extensive series of experiments carried out by the optical society of america in the 1940s resulting in the notations ( sample definitions ) for the modern munsell book of color one of the first books about the munsell color system , explaining the intuition behind its three dimensions , and suggesting possible uses of the system in picking color combinations an edited version can be found at a description of color systems leading up to munsell 's , and a biographical explanation of munsell 's changing ideas about color and development of his color solid , leading up to the publication of a color notation in 1905 applepainter.com , a site explaining the munsell color chart , including an edited version of cleland 's book , a practical description of the munsell color system

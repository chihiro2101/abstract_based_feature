laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft this development is inspired by new , participatory science to science and innovation and relies on user-centred design methods iso 13407 : ( 1999 ) , titled human-centred design processes for interactive systems , is an iso standard providing guidance on human-centred design activities throughout the life cycle of interactive computer-based systems one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the laboratory is called speculum alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in prague laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory : the classical equipment includes tools such as bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers , spectrophotometers and calorimeters the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories rules exist to minimize the individual 's risk , and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency in determining the proper chemical hygiene plan for a particular business or laboratory , it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard , evaluation of the current safety , health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards many schools and businesses employ safety , health , and environmental specialists , such as a chemical hygiene officer ( cho ) to develop , manage , and evaluate their chp additionally , third party review is also used to provide an objective '' outside view '' which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity the division of labor : '' occurs between designers and operatives ; researchers , engineers , and technicians ; theoreticians and experimenters ; senior researchers , junior researchers and students ; those who publish , those who sign the publications and the others ; and between specialities the main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory ( researchers , administrators , receptionists , technicians , etc cargo cult science chemical accident contamination control controlled lab reactor environmental health fume hood hackspace iso/iec 17025 lab website laboratory automation laboratory safety science tourism standard conditions for temperature and pressure workshop

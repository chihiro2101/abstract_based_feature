laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices this laboratory was created when pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string in the painting of louis pasteur by albert edelfelt in 1885 , louis pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand , and not wearing any personal protective equipment laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory : the classical equipment includes tools such as bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers , spectrophotometers and calorimeters larger or more sophisticated equipment is generally called a scientific instrument the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories laboratory hazards might include poisons ; infectious agents ; flammable , explosive , or radioactive materials ; moving machinery ; extreme temperatures ; lasers , strong magnetic fields or high voltage this standard is often referred to as the '' laboratory standard '' in determining the proper chemical hygiene plan for a particular business or laboratory , it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard , evaluation of the current safety , health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards an important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to or work in the laboratory work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member the degree of entitlement , which is also referred to as a staff 's rights , affects social interaction between staff so a consequence of this social hierarchy is that the locator discloses various degrees of information , based on the staff member and their rights in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization

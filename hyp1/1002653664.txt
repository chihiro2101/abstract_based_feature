laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior engineers use laboratories as well to design , build , and test technological devices : '' originally : a room or building for the practice of alchemy and the preparation of medicines for the purposes of research , teaching , or analysis ; ( also ) one in which chemicals or drugs are manufactured '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist a 16th century underground alchemical laboratory was accidentally discovered in the year 2002 the laboratory is called speculum alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in prague the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories rules exist to minimize the individual 's risk , and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency this standard is often referred to as the '' laboratory standard '' under this standard , a laboratory is required to produce a chemical hygiene plan ( chp ) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location , and its approach to them an important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to or work in the laboratory the main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory ( researchers , administrators , receptionists , technicians , etc a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member so a consequence of this social hierarchy is that the locator discloses various degrees of information , based on the staff member and their rights in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization

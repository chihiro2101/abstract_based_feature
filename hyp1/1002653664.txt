laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data engineers use laboratories as well to design , build , and test technological devices scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts , the term '' laboratory '' is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as living lab , fab lab , or hackerspaces , in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes , working collaboratively or sharing resources lead users : a source of novel product concepts one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist researching in teams started in the 19th century , and many new kinds of equipment were developed in the 20th century laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories in many laboratories , hazards are present from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity the main subject of the study revolved around the relationship between the staff of a laboratory ( researchers , administrators , receptionists , technicians , etc in summary , differences in attitude among members of the laboratory are explained by social organization : a person 's attitudes are intimately related to the role they have in an organization this hierarchy helps understand information distribution , control , and attitudes towards technologies in the laboratory

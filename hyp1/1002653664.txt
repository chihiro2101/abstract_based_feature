laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior engineers use laboratories as well to design , build , and test technological devices scientific laboratories can be found as research room and learning spaces in schools and university , industry , government , or military facilities , and even aboard ships and spacecraft despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts , the term '' laboratory '' is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as living lab , fab lab , or hackerspaces , in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes , working collaboratively or sharing resources one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices this laboratory was created when pythagoras conducted an experiment about tones of sound and vibration of string in the painting of louis pasteur by albert edelfelt in 1885 , louis pasteur is shown comparing a note in his left hand with a bottle filled with a solid in his right hand , and not wearing any personal protective equipment the laboratory is called speculum alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in prague larger or more sophisticated equipment is generally called a scientific instrument these notably include : film laboratory or darkroom clandestine lab for the production of illegal drugs computer lab crime lab used to process crime scene evidence language laboratory medical laboratory ( involves handling of chemical compounds ) public health laboratory industrial laboratory rules exist to minimize the individual 's risk , and safety equipment is used to protect the lab users from injury or to assist in responding to an emergency the occupational safety and health administration ( osha ) in the united states , recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace , has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories in determining the proper chemical hygiene plan for a particular business or laboratory , it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard , evaluation of the current safety , health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards work is divided , not only between different jobs of the laboratory such as the researchers , engineers and technicians , but also in terms of autonomy ( should the work be individual or in groups ) as an example , administrators , in one lab of the study , do not have the right to ask the locator where the researchers currently are , as they are not entitled to such information cargo cult science chemical accident contamination control controlled lab reactor environmental health fume hood hackspace iso/iec 17025 lab website laboratory automation laboratory safety science tourism standard conditions for temperature and pressure workshop

laboratories used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science and engineering a physics laboratory might contain a particle accelerator or vacuum chamber , while a metallurgy laboratory could have apparatus for casting or refining metals or for testing their strength a chemist or biology might use a wet laboratory , while a psychology laboratory might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior in some laboratories , such as those commonly used by computer scientists , computers ( sometimes supercomputers ) are used for either simulations or the analysis of data engineers use laboratories as well to design , build , and test technological devices despite the underlying notion of the lab as a confined space for experts , the term '' laboratory '' is also increasingly applied to workshop spaces such as living lab , fab lab , or hackerspaces , in which people meet to work on societal problems or make prototypes , working collaboratively or sharing resources one distinctive feature of work in open labs is phenomena of translation , driven by the different backgrounds and levels of expertise of the people involved '' the emergence of big science during world war ii increased the size of laboratories and scientific equipment , introducing particle accelerators and similar devices the earliest laboratory according to the present evidence is a home laboratory of pythagoras of samos , the well-known greek philosopher and scientist the laboratory is called speculum alchemiae and is preserved as a museum in prague laboratory techniques are the set of procedures used on natural sciences such as chemistry , biology , physics to conduct an experiment , all of them follow the scientific method ; while some of them involve the use of complex laboratory equipment from laboratory glassware to electrical devices , and others require more specific or expensive supplies laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory : the classical equipment includes tools such as bunsen burners and microscopes as well as specialty equipment such as operant conditioning chambers , spectrophotometers and calorimeters the title of laboratory is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories in determining the proper chemical hygiene plan for a particular business or laboratory , it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard , evaluation of the current safety , health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards many schools and businesses employ safety , health , and environmental specialists , such as a chemical hygiene officer ( cho ) to develop , manage , and evaluate their chp from the 1950s , the laboratory has evolved from being an educational tool used by teachers to attract the top students into research , into an organizational model allowing a high level of scientific productivity a locator is an employee of a laboratory who is in charge of knowing where each member of the laboratory currently is , based on a unique signal emitted from the badge of each staff member as an example , administrators , in one lab of the study , do not have the right to ask the locator where the researchers currently are , as they are not entitled to such information nobel laureates interactive 360Â° laboratories qa explore

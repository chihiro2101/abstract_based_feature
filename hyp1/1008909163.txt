he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities he was a visiting scholar at the institute for advanced study in 1995 and a visiting professor at imperial college london ( 1999-2001 ) before becoming one of the founding faculty members at the perimeter institute in 2001 smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops between 1999 and 2002 , smolin made several proposals to provide a fundamental formulation of string theory that does not depend on approximate descriptions involving classical background spacetime models smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the phenomenological quantum gravity by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena smolin has worked since the early 1980s on a series of proposals for hidden variables theories , which would be non-local deterministic theories which would give a precise description of individual quantum phenomena smolin 's hypothesis of cosmological natural selection , also called the fecund universes theory , suggests that a process analogous to biological natural selection applies at the grandest of scales when smolin published the theory in 1992 , he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun both predictions have held up , and they demonstrate smolin 's main thesis : that the theory of cosmological natural selection is karl popper since 2006 , he has collaborated with the brazilian philosopher and harvard law school professor roberto mangabeira unger on the issues of the reality of time and the evolution of laws ; in 2014 they published a book , its two parts being written separately , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 time reborn argues that physical science has made time unreal while , as smolin insists , it is the most fundamental feature of reality : '' space may be an illusion , but time must be real '' ( p as a case study , the trouble with physics focused on the issue of the falsifiability of string theory due to the proposals that the anthropic principle be used to explain the properties of our universe in the context of the string landscape in his earlier book three roads to quantum gravity ( 2002 ) , smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives smolin 's view on the nature of time : more and more , i have the feeling that quantum theory and general relativity are both deeply wrong about the nature of time 256 ) smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a '' final theory '' : i am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 in 2007 he was awarded the majorana prize from the electronic journal of theoretical physics , and in 2009 the klopsteg memorial award from the american association of physics teachers ( aapt ) for '' extraordinary accomplishments in communicating the excitement of physics to the general public , '' he is a fellow of the royal society of canada and the american physical society the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy by lee smolin and roberto mangabeira unger , cambridge university press , 2019

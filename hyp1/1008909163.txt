he received his ph.d in theoretical physics from harvard university in 1979 he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities he was a visiting scholar at the institute for advanced study in 1995 and a visiting professor at imperial college london ( 1999-2001 ) before becoming one of the founding faculty members at the perimeter institute in 2001 smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops between 1999 and 2002 , smolin made several proposals to provide a fundamental formulation of string theory that does not depend on approximate descriptions involving classical background spacetime models experimental tests of quantum gravity smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the phenomenological quantum gravity by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena in recent years , he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time , called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence when smolin published the theory in 1992 , he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun smolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational , or leibnizian , view of space and time since 2006 , he has collaborated with the brazilian philosopher and harvard law school professor roberto mangabeira unger on the issues of the reality of time and the evolution of laws ; in 2014 they published a book , its two parts being written separately , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 time reborn argues that physical science has made time unreal while , as smolin insists , it is the most fundamental feature of reality : '' space may be an illusion , but time must be real '' ( p the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches finally , the trouble with physics is also broadly concerned with the role of controversy and the value of diverse approaches in the ethics and process of science smolin 's view on the nature of time : more and more , i have the feeling that quantum theory and general relativity are both deeply wrong about the nature of time 256 ) smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a '' final theory '' : i am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy by lee smolin and roberto mangabeira unger , cambridge university press , 2019

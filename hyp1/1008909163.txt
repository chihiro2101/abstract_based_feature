smolin was born in new york city smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops with rovelli he discovered the discreteness of areas and volumes and found their natural expression in terms of a discrete description of quantum geometry in terms of spin networks between 1999 and 2002 , smolin made several proposals to provide a fundamental formulation of string theory that does not depend on approximate descriptions involving classical background spacetime models smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the phenomenological quantum gravity by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena in recent years , he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time , called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence smolin 's hypothesis of cosmological natural selection , also called the fecund universes theory , suggests that a process analogous to biological natural selection applies at the grandest of scales smolin published the idea in 1992 and summarized it in a book aimed at a lay audience called the life of the cosmos when smolin published the theory in 1992 , he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun smolin also predicted that inflation , if true , must only be in its simplest form , governed by a single field and parameter , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 in his earlier book three roads to quantum gravity ( 2002 ) , smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches smolin suggests that string theory suffers from serious deficiencies and has an unhealthy near-monopoly in the particle theory community in the same year that the trouble with physics was published , peter woit published a book for nonspecialists whose conclusion was similar to smolin 's , namely that string theory was a fundamentally flawed research program a reason for asserting it , is that anything that existed for just one moment , without causing or implying some aspect of the world at a future moment , would be gone in the next moment an atom at one moment is a process leading to a different or a changed atom at the next moment '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy by lee smolin and roberto mangabeira unger , cambridge university press , 2019

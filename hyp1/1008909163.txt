he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops between 1999 and 2002 , smolin made several proposals to provide a fundamental formulation of string theory that does not depend on approximate descriptions involving classical background spacetime models experimental tests of quantum gravity smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the phenomenological quantum gravity by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena smolin has worked since the early 1980s on a series of proposals for hidden variables theories , which would be non-local deterministic theories which would give a precise description of individual quantum phenomena the theory contains the evolutionary ideas of '' reproduction '' and '' mutation '' of universes , and so is formally analogous to models of population biology when smolin published the theory in 1992 , he proposed as a prediction of his theory that no neutron star should exist with a mass of more than 1.6 times the mass of the sun , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 time reborn argues that physical science has made time unreal while , as smolin insists , it is the most fundamental feature of reality : '' space may be an illusion , but time must be real '' ( p smolin 's 2006 book the trouble with physics explored the role of controversy and disagreement in the progress of science it argued that science progresses fastest if the scientific community encourages the widest possible disagreement among trained and accredited professionals prior to the formation of consensus brought about by experimental confirmation of predictions of falsifiable theories the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches he called for a diversity of approaches to quantum gravity , and argued that more attention should be paid to loop quantum gravity , an approach smolin has devised smolin 's view on the nature of time : more and more , i have the feeling that quantum theory and general relativity are both deeply wrong about the nature of time 256 ) smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a '' final theory '' : i am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy by lee smolin and roberto mangabeira unger , cambridge university press , 2019 a partial list of smolin 's published work a debate of the merits of string theory between smolin and brian greene , from national public radio ( 2006 ) '' the unique universe '' : smolin explains his skepticism re the multiverse ( 2009 ) closer to the truth : series of interviews by smolin on fundamental issues in physics : smolin 's presentation at the royal society of arts ( 2013 )

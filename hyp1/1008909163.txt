smolin , became a professor in the cumberland school of law in birmingham , alabama he received his ph.d in theoretical physics from harvard university in 1979 he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities he was a visiting scholar at the institute for advanced study in 1995 and a visiting professor at imperial college london ( 1999-2001 ) before becoming one of the founding faculty members at the perimeter institute in 2001 smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops with rovelli he discovered the discreteness of areas and volumes and found their natural expression in terms of a discrete description of quantum geometry in terms of spin networks between 1999 and 2002 , smolin made several proposals to provide a fundamental formulation of string theory that does not depend on approximate descriptions involving classical background spacetime models smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the phenomenological quantum gravity by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena in recent years , he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time , called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence smolin 's hypothesis of cosmological natural selection , also called the fecund universes theory , suggests that a process analogous to biological natural selection applies at the grandest of scales smolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational , or leibnizian , view of space and time since 2006 , he has collaborated with the brazilian philosopher and harvard law school professor roberto mangabeira unger on the issues of the reality of time and the evolution of laws ; in 2014 they published a book , its two parts being written separately , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 he proposed that this meant the fostering of diverse competing research programs , and that premature formation of paradigms not forced by experimental facts can slow the progress of science in his earlier book three roads to quantum gravity ( 2002 ) , smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches he called for a diversity of approaches to quantum gravity , and argued that more attention should be paid to loop quantum gravity , an approach smolin has devised the trouble with physics , houghton mifflin co , new york , 2006 256 ) smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a '' final theory '' : i am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory

he held postdoctoral research positions at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara and the university of chicago , before becoming a faculty member at yale , syracuse and pennsylvania state universities he was a visiting scholar at the institute for advanced study in 1995 and a visiting professor at imperial college london ( 1999-2001 ) before becoming one of the founding faculty members at the perimeter institute in 2001 smolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in collaborative work with ted jacobson , carlo rovelli , louis crane , abhay ashtekar and others lqg is an approach to the unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity which utilizes a reformulation of general relativity in the language of gauge theory , which allows the use of techniques from particle physics , particularly the expression of fields in terms of the dynamics of loops smolin is among those theorists who have proposed that the phenomenological quantum gravity by searching for modifications in special relativity detected in observations of high energy astrophysical phenomena among smolin 's contributions are the coinvention of doubly special relativity ( with jo√£o magueijo , independently of work by giovanni amelino-camelia ) and of relative locality ( with amelino-camelia , laurent freidel and jerzy kowalski-glikman ) smolin has worked since the early 1980s on a series of proposals for hidden variables theories , which would be non-local deterministic theories which would give a precise description of individual quantum phenomena in recent years , he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time , called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence smolin published the idea in 1992 and summarized it in a book aimed at a lay audience called the life of the cosmos smolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational , or leibnizian , view of space and time , ( 2014 ) , the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy , cambridge university press , a book length exposition of smolin 's philosophical views appeared in april 2013 smolin 's 2006 book the trouble with physics explored the role of controversy and disagreement in the progress of science in his earlier book three roads to quantum gravity ( 2002 ) , smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives the trouble with physics , on the other hand , was strongly critical of the prominence of string theory in contemporary theoretical physics , which he believes has suppressed research in other promising approaches he called for a diversity of approaches to quantum gravity , and argued that more attention should be paid to loop quantum gravity , an approach smolin has devised in the same year that the trouble with physics was published , peter woit published a book for nonspecialists whose conclusion was similar to smolin 's , namely that string theory was a fundamentally flawed research program 256 ) smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a '' final theory '' : i am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory '' a possible solution for the problem of time in quantum cosmology '' on edge ( april 7 , 1997 ) the trouble with physics was named by newsweek magazine as number 17 on a list of 50 '' books for our time '' , june 27 , 2009 the trouble with physics : the rise of string theory , the fall of a science , and what comes next the singular universe and the reality of time : a proposal in natural philosophy by lee smolin and roberto mangabeira unger , cambridge university press , 2019

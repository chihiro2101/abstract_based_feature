with the advent of popular broadcast television , producers realized they needed more than live television programming however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate various displays , including projectors for these '' video rate films '' , slide projectors and film cameras were often combined into a '' film chain '' , allowing the broadcaster to cue up various forms of media and switch between them by moving a mirror or prism color was supported by using a multi-tube video camera , prisms , and filters to separate the original color signal and feed the red , green and blue to individual tubes the obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates , but this , at least in the case of ntsc , is rather obvious to the eye and ear the most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal this is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample , but when this is not true , a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s discussion of telecine equipment by former bbc engineers demonstration of telecine process by telecine and archiving expert , tim emlem-english explanation of telecine methods

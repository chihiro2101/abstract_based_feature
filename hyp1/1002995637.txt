by turning to film-originated material , they would have access to the wealth of films made for the cinema in addition to recorded television programming on film that could be aired at different times however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate however , this still left film shot at cinema frame rates as a problem the obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates , but this , at least in the case of ntsc , is rather obvious to the eye and ear a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display however , during the analogue broadcasting period , the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slightly faster 25 frames per second rate , to match the pal video signal this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured 2:2 pulldown is also used to transfer shows and films , photographed at 30 frames per second , like friends and oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , to ntsc video , which has ~59.94 & nbsp ; hz scanning rate in order to accommodate this mismatch in frame rate , 24 frames of film have to be distributed over 50 pal fields this brings the refresh rate from 25 frames to exactly 60,000/1001 , or ~59.94 , fields per second , with no change whatsoever in speed , duration , or audio pitch the term '' pulldown '' comes from the mechanical process of '' pulling '' ( physically moving ) the film downward within the film portion of the transport mechanism , to advance it from one frame to the next at a repetitive rate ( nominally 24 frames/s )

however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display home movies originally on film may be transferred to video tape using this technique , and it is not uncommon to find telecined dvds where the source was originally recorded on videotape , or shot on film and then edited on tape movies and tv shows that were originally shot and edited on film , or digitally , are more commonly put on dvd at their native frame rate with flags that tell the dvd player to perform pulldown on-the-fly in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video this can be accomplished by inserting a pulldown field every 12 frames , thus effectively spreading 12 frames of film over 25 fields ( or '' 12.5 frames '' ) of pal video they are rendered at exactly 25.000 frames per second ; then , for pal/secam distribution , ordinary 2:2 pulldown is applied , but for ntsc distribution , 199 fields out of every 1001 are repeated this brings the refresh rate from 25 frames to exactly 60,000/1001 , or ~59.94 , fields per second , with no change whatsoever in speed , duration , or audio pitch for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s the second step of the 2:3 pulldown is distributing cinema frames into video fields

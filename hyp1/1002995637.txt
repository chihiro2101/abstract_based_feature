by turning to film-originated material , they would have access to the wealth of films made for the cinema in addition to recorded television programming on film that could be aired at different times however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering 368-9 non-live programming could also be filmed using the same cameras , edited mechanically as normal , and then played back for tv various displays , including projectors for these '' video rate films '' , slide projectors and film cameras were often combined into a '' film chain '' , allowing the broadcaster to cue up various forms of media and switch between them by moving a mirror or prism the obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates , but this , at least in the case of ntsc , is rather obvious to the eye and ear a more advanced technique is to use '' 2:3 pulldown '' , discussed below , which turns every second frame of the film into three fields of video , which results in a slightly smoother display however , during the analogue broadcasting period , the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slightly faster 25 frames per second rate , to match the pal video signal home movies originally on film may be transferred to video tape using this technique , and it is not uncommon to find telecined dvds where the source was originally recorded on videotape , or shot on film and then edited on tape this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured 2:2 pulldown is also used to transfer shows and films , photographed at 30 frames per second , like friends and oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , to ntsc video , which has ~59.94 & nbsp ; hz scanning rate for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s

however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate as the film was run at the same speed as the television , the flickering was eliminated the obvious solution is to simply speed up the film to match the television frame rates , but this , at least in the case of ntsc , is rather obvious to the eye and ear however , during the analogue broadcasting period , the 24 frame per second film was shown at a slightly faster 25 frames per second rate , to match the pal video signal every time the video ( tele ) part of the telecine samples the light electronically , the film ( cine ) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph this allows them to scan a distinct frame of digital video for each frame of film , providing higher quality than a telecine system would be able to achieve in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video in order to accommodate this mismatch in frame rate , 24 frames of film have to be distributed over 50 pal fields for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s the term '' pulldown '' comes from the mechanical process of '' pulling '' ( physically moving ) the film downward within the film portion of the transport mechanism , to advance it from one frame to the next at a repetitive rate ( nominally 24 frames/s )

with the advent of popular broadcast television , producers realized they needed more than live television programming by turning to film-originated material , they would have access to the wealth of films made for the cinema in addition to recorded television programming on film that could be aired at different times however , the difference in frame rates between film ( generally 24 frames/s ) and television ( 30 or 25 frames/s , interlaced ) meant that simply playing a film into a television camera would result in flickering originally the kinescope was used to record the image from a television display to film , synchronized to the tv scan rate 368-9 non-live programming could also be filmed using the same cameras , edited mechanically as normal , and then played back for tv as the film was run at the same speed as the television , the flickering was eliminated in recent decades , telecine has primarily been a film-to-storage process , as opposed to film-to-air the most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal every time the video ( tele ) part of the telecine samples the light electronically , the film ( cine ) part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph in countries that use the pal or secam video standards , film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second the pal video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second , so the transfer from film to video is simple ; for every film frame , one video frame is captured for film at 24 frame/s , there are 24 frames of film for every 25 frames of pal video for the film 's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal , a telecine must use a technique called the 2:3 pulldown , also known as 3:2 pulldown , to convert from 24 to ~29.97 frame/s

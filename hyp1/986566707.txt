within the scope of the reform , a precursor company was initially established in 1997 to facilitate a transformation of the rail freight transport division structured under public law into a private enterprise company before the company db cargo ag was ultimately founded on 1 january 1999 the deutsche bahn group planned to invest billions in its subsidiary in order to improve its position in the transport and logistics market when the competitive environment with other european providers became increasingly tough , deutsche bahn ( db ) and the dutch state-owned rail company nederlanse spoorwegen ( ns ) announced plans to merge their rail freight transport activities in 1998 together , db cargo and ns cargo reached revenues of around 6.9 billion deutsche mark ( 3.5 billion euros ) and had 50,000 employees their amalgamation was the first ever cross-border rail merger , in which deutsche bahn retained its majority share of 94 % a financial holding company was created for this new company and began operations under the name railion in the year 2000 railion laid the foundation for the establishment of a leading european transport and logistics company that was open to further partners right from the start the cooperation between db , ns and dsb played an essential role in deutsche bahn 's long-term strategy for expansion in other european countries db cargo , ns cargo and other railion companies subsequently solely focused on freight forwarding while stinnes and schenker took on central tasks in the fields of rail freight transport and sales by consolidating all of its transport and logistics activities , deutsche bahn also aimed to achieve growth in the freight transport domain the company adjusted its image to reflect this aim and as a result , db cargo was renamed railion deutschland at this point , the general objective pursued by deutsche bahn was to better cover the entire transport chain with all transportation means and routes in 2009 , deutsche bahn abandoned the railion brand and instead chose to consolidate all of its rail freight transport activities under the name db schenker rail media reports , however , already began to speculate about a stock market launch of the newly formed db schenker division the business operations of db schenker rail experienced a significant decline in the 2010s to reflect the company 's focus on its core business activities in the domain of rail freight transport , it was again renamed and designated as db cargo ag in 2016 db cargo and db schenker are now equal sister companies within the integrated rail system of the db group although the wagons used by db cargo have generally become older in recent years , they have also increased in size so that they can transport larger quantities of goods when it transferred the assets and liabilities of its former freight transport division as part of the spin-off for the establishment of a new company , deutsche bahn ag acquired all of the company 's shares and is therefore the sole shareholder of db cargo ag in 2010 , deutsche bahn joined other rail companies in becoming a partner of the european , represented by its subsidiary db schenker rail ( now db cargo ) single wagonload transport plays a special role in the observation of the economic development of db cargo

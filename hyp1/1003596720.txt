because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines a major practical drawback to the vlf band is that because of the length of the waves , full size resonant antennas ( half wave dipole or monopole antenna antennas ) can not be built because of their physical height vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high due to their low radiation resistance ( often less than one ohm ) they are inefficient , radiating only 10 % to 50 % of the transmitter power at most , with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long due to the low radiation resistance , to minimize power dissipated in the ground these antennas require extremely low resistance ground ( earthing ) systems , consisting of radial networks of buried copper wires under the antenna a large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant vlf antennas have very narrow bandwidth and to change the transmitting frequency requires a variable inductor ( variometer ) to tune the antenna the high results in very high voltages ( up to 200 & nbsp ; kv ) on the antenna and very good insulation is required a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation so when the frequency of the transmitter is shifted between the ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' frequencies , the saturable reactor changes the inductance in the antenna resonant circuit to shift the antenna resonant frequency to follow the transmitter 's frequency a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used vlf antennas typically operate '' voltage-limited '' , with the voltage on the antenna close to the limit that the insulation will stand , so they will not tolerate any abrupt change in the voltage or current from the transmitter without arcing or other insulation problems for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' ; minimum-shift keying ( msk ) : a continuous phase version of fsk designed specifically for small bandwidths , this was adopted by naval vlf stations in the 1970s to increase the data rate and is now the standard mode used in military vlf transmitters in msk the frequency of the transmitter is switched only when the two sine waves have the same phase , at the point both sine waves cross zero in the same direction historically , this band was used for long distance transoceanic radio communication during the wireless telegraphy era between about 1905 and 1925 it used frequency shift keying ( fsk ) to send data , shifting between 20 & nbsp ; khz and 26 & nbsp ; khz since it can penetrate seawater vlf is used by the military to communicate with submarines near the surface , while elf frequencies are used for deeply submerged subs the frequency range below 8.3 & nbsp ; khz is not allocated by the international telecommunication union and in some nations may be used license-free operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz vlf signals are often monitored by radio amateurs using simple homemade vlf radio receivers based on personal computers ( pcs )

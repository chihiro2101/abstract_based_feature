because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves the conductive ionosphere and the conductive earth form a horizontal '' duct '' a few vlf wavelengths high , which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they do n't escape into space vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines a major practical drawback to the vlf band is that because of the length of the waves , full size resonant antennas ( half wave dipole or monopole antenna antennas ) can not be built because of their physical height vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the bandwidth of large capacitively loaded vlf antennas is so narrow ( 50–100 & nbsp ; hz ) that even the small frequency shifts of fsk and msk modulation may exceed it , throwing the antenna out of resonance , causing the antenna to reflect some power back down the feedline the traditional solution is to use a '' bandwidth resistor '' in the antenna which reduces the , increasing the bandwidth ; however this also reduces the power output a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation so when the frequency of the transmitter is shifted between the ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' frequencies , the saturable reactor changes the inductance in the antenna resonant circuit to shift the antenna resonant frequency to follow the transmitter 's frequency the requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent , because of the high level of natural atmospheric noise in the band atmospheric radio noise is far above the noise figure introduced by the receiver circuit and determines the receiver signal to noise ratio so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used , and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise a typical am radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 & nbsp ; khz would occupy one third of the vlf band in military networks frequency shift keying ( fsk ) modulation is used to transmit radioteletype data using 5 & nbsp ; bit ita2 or 8 & nbsp ; bit ascii character codes a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used vlf antennas typically operate '' voltage-limited '' , with the voltage on the antenna close to the limit that the insulation will stand , so they will not tolerate any abrupt change in the voltage or current from the transmitter without arcing or other insulation problems for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' it used frequency shift keying ( fsk ) to send data , shifting between 20 & nbsp ; khz and 26 & nbsp ; khz two alternative character sets may be used : 5 & nbsp ; bit ita2 or 8 & nbsp ; bit ascii the frequency range below 8.3 & nbsp ; khz is not allocated by the international telecommunication union and in some nations may be used license-free useful received signal strengths are as low as & nbsp ; volts/meter ( electric field ) and & nbsp ; tesla ( magnetic field ) , with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 & nbsp ; bits per hour

because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves the conductive ionosphere and the conductive earth form a horizontal '' duct '' a few vlf wavelengths high , which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they do n't escape into space vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines a major practical drawback to the vlf band is that because of the length of the waves , full size resonant antennas ( half wave dipole or monopole antenna antennas ) can not be built because of their physical height vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high due to their low radiation resistance ( often less than one ohm ) they are inefficient , radiating only 10 % to 50 % of the transmitter power at most , with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long a large loading coil is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation atmospheric radio noise is far above the noise figure introduced by the receiver circuit and determines the receiver signal to noise ratio so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used , and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) a typical am radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 & nbsp ; khz would occupy one third of the vlf band in military networks frequency shift keying ( fsk ) modulation is used to transmit radioteletype data using 5 & nbsp ; bit ita2 or 8 & nbsp ; bit ascii character codes a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used it used frequency shift keying ( fsk ) to send data , shifting between 20 & nbsp ; khz and 26 & nbsp ; khz jim creek naval radio station in oso , washington state , which transmits on 24.8 & nbsp ; khz with a power of 1.2 & nbsp ; mw u.s vlf transmitter cutler at cutler , maine which transmits on 24 & nbsp ; khz with 1.8 & nbsp ; mw radiated power from amateur stations is very small , ranging from 1 & nbsp ; μw to 100 & nbsp ; μw for fixed base station antennas , and up to 10 & nbsp ; mw from kite or balloon antennas

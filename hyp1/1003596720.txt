because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves the conductive ionosphere and the conductive earth form a horizontal '' duct '' a few vlf wavelengths high , which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they do n't escape into space vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long high power stations use variations on the umbrella antenna such as the '' delta '' and '' trideco '' antennas , or multiwire flattop ( triatic ) antennas counterpoise systems have also been used , consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna the high results in very high voltages ( up to 200 & nbsp ; kv ) on the antenna and very good insulation is required large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used , and the low voltage signal from the antenna can simply be amplified by the receiver without introducing significant noise because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) in military networks frequency shift keying ( fsk ) modulation is used to transmit radioteletype data using 5 & nbsp ; bit ita2 or 8 & nbsp ; bit ascii character codes a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna this is required due to the high of the antenna the of large vlf antennas is typically over 200 ; this means the antenna stores far more energy ( 200 & nbsp ; times as much ) than is supplied or radiated in any single cycle of the transmitter current the simplest and earliest form of radio data transmission , this was used from the beginning of the 20th & nbsp ; century to the 1960s in commercial and military vlf stations for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' a problem at vlf is that when the frequency is switched the two sine waves usually have different phases , which creates a sudden phase shift transient which can cause arcing on the antenna jim creek naval radio station in oso , washington state , which transmits on 24.8 & nbsp ; khz with a power of 1.2 & nbsp ; mw u.s vlf transmitter cutler at cutler , maine which transmits on 24 & nbsp ; khz with 1.8 & nbsp ; mw operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz useful received signal strengths are as low as & nbsp ; volts/meter ( electric field ) and & nbsp ; tesla ( magnetic field ) , with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 & nbsp ; bits per hour

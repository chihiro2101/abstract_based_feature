because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines a major practical drawback to the vlf band is that because of the length of the waves , full size resonant antennas ( half wave dipole or monopole antenna antennas ) can not be built because of their physical height vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high high power transmitting antennas for vlf frequencies are very large wire antennas , up to several kilometers long at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the large vlf antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only 50-100 & nbsp ; hertz , and when transmitting frequency shift keying ( fsk ) , the usual mode , the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation , between the two fsk frequencies large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna so when the frequency of the transmitter is shifted between the ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' frequencies , the saturable reactor changes the inductance in the antenna resonant circuit to shift the antenna resonant frequency to follow the transmitter 's frequency because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) a typical am radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 & nbsp ; khz would occupy one third of the vlf band a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used the of large vlf antennas is typically over 200 ; this means the antenna stores far more energy ( 200 & nbsp ; times as much ) than is supplied or radiated in any single cycle of the transmitter current the carrier is turned on and off , with carrier on representing the morse code '' dots '' and '' dashes '' and carrier off representing spaces the simplest and earliest form of radio data transmission , this was used from the beginning of the 20th & nbsp ; century to the 1960s in commercial and military vlf stations for example , a frequency of 9070 & nbsp ; hz might be used to indicate a ' 1 ' and the frequency 9020 & nbsp ; hz , 50 & nbsp ; hz lower , to indicate a ' 0 ' a problem at vlf is that when the frequency is switched the two sine waves usually have different phases , which creates a sudden phase shift transient which can cause arcing on the antenna if the two frequencies representing ' 1 ' and ' 0 ' are 50 & nbsp ; hz apart , the standard frequency shift used in military vlf stations , their phases coincide every 20 & nbsp ; ms msk can be used at data rates up to 300 & nbsp ; bit/s , or about 35 & nbsp ; ascii characters ( 8 & nbsp ; bits each ) per second , approximately 450 & nbsp ; words per minute it used frequency shift keying ( fsk ) to send data , shifting between 20 & nbsp ; khz and 26 & nbsp ; khz examples of naval vlf transmitters are britain 's skelton transmitting station in skelton , cumbria germany 's dho38 in rhauderfehn , which transmits on 23.4 & nbsp ; khz with a power of 800 & nbsp ; kw u.s operations tend to congregate around the frequencies 8.27 & nbsp ; khz , 6.47 & nbsp ; khz , 5.17 & nbsp ; khz , and 2.97 & nbsp ; khz radiated power from amateur stations is very small , ranging from 1 & nbsp ; μw to 100 & nbsp ; μw for fixed base station antennas , and up to 10 & nbsp ; mw from kite or balloon antennas

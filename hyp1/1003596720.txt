because of their long wavelengths , vlf radio waves can diffract around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges , and can propagate as ground waves following the curvature of the earth and so are not limited by the horizon the earth is surrounded by a conductive layer of electrons and ions in the upper atmosphere at the bottom of the ionosphere called the d layer at 60–90 & nbsp ; km ( 37–56 & nbsp ; miles ) altitude , which reflects vlf radio waves the conductive ionosphere and the conductive earth form a horizontal '' duct '' a few vlf wavelengths high , which acts as a waveguide confining the waves so they do n't escape into space vlf waves have very low path attenuation , 2–3 & nbsp ; db per 1,000 & nbsp ; km , with little of the '' fading '' experienced at higher frequencies therefore , vlf transmissions are very stable and reliable , and are used for long distance communication however , atmospheric noise ( “ sferics ” ) is high in the band , including such phenomena as '' whistlers '' , caused by lightning vlf waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of at least 10–40 & nbsp ; meters ( 30–130 & nbsp ; feet ) , depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water , so they are used to communicate with submarines vertical antennas must be used because vlf waves propagate in vertical polarization , but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30 & nbsp ; khz ( 10 & nbsp ; km wavelength ) would be high very high power transmitters ( ~1 & nbsp ; megawatt ) are required for long distance communication , so the efficiency of the antenna is an important factor at vlf the design of this coil is challenging ; it must have low resistance at the operating rf frequency , high , and must withstand the high voltage on the antenna end the high results in very high voltages ( up to 200 & nbsp ; kv ) on the antenna and very good insulation is required large vlf antennas usually operate in 'voltage limited ' mode : the maximum power of the transmitter is limited by the voltage the antenna can accept without air breakdown , corona , and arcing from the antenna the traditional solution is to use a '' bandwidth resistor '' in the antenna which reduces the , increasing the bandwidth ; however this also reduces the power output a recent alternative used in some military vlf transmitters is a circuit which dynamically shifts the antenna 's resonant frequency between the two output frequencies with the modulation this is a magnetic core inductor with a second control winding through which a dc current flows , which controls the inductance by magnetizing the core , changing its permeability the requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent , because of the high level of natural atmospheric noise in the band because of the small bandwidth of the band , and the extremely narrow bandwidth of the antennas used , it is impractical to transmit audio signals ( am or fm radiotelephony ) a typical am radio signal with a bandwidth of 10 & nbsp ; khz would occupy one third of the vlf band a small frequency shift of 30-50 & nbsp ; hertz is used due to the small bandwidth of the antenna in high power vlf transmitters , to increase the allowable data rate , a special form of fsk called minimum shift keying ( msk ) is used ; frequency-shift keying ( fsk ) : fsk is the second oldest and second simplest form of digital radio data modulation , after cw ; minimum-shift keying ( msk ) : a continuous phase version of fsk designed specifically for small bandwidths , this was adopted by naval vlf stations in the 1970s to increase the data rate and is now the standard mode used in military vlf transmitters msk can be used at data rates up to 300 & nbsp ; bit/s , or about 35 & nbsp ; ascii characters ( 8 & nbsp ; bits each ) per second , approximately 450 & nbsp ; words per minute early attempts were made to use radiotelephone using amplitude modulation and single-sideband modulation within the band starting from 20 & nbsp ; khz , but the result was unsatisfactory because the available bandwidth was insufficient to contain the sidebands the frequency range below 8.3 & nbsp ; khz is not allocated by the international telecommunication union and in some nations may be used license-free useful received signal strengths are as low as & nbsp ; volts/meter ( electric field ) and & nbsp ; tesla ( magnetic field ) , with signaling rates typically between 1 and 100 & nbsp ; bits per hour communication with submarines omega navigation system , 1971–1997 radio atmospheric

although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising furthermore , limited animation , such as that produced by such studios as filmation , depatieâ€“freleng enterprises , total television , jay ward productions and hanna-barbera , was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot , as compared to live-action programming while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages until the late 1960s , a number of saturday-morning cartoons were rerun of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier some saturday-morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters , such as the looney tunes and merrie melodies cartoons produced by warner bros cartoons , the tom and jerry cartoons produced by metro-goldwyn-mayer and directed by william hanna and joseph barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company ; the mighty mouse and heckle and jeckle cartoons produced by paul terry 's terrytoons , and walter lantz 's woody woodpecker cartoons the remainder of the networks ' saturday-morning schedules were filled by reruns of black-and-white live-action series made in the 1950s , usually with a western background ( the lone ranger , the roy rogers show , sky king , fury , the adventures of rin tin tin , my friend flicka , etc the mid-1960s brought a boom in superhero cartoon series , some adapted from comic book , ( superman , aquaman , spider-man , fantastic four ) , and others original ( space ghost , the herculoids , birdman and the galaxy trio , etc another development was the popular music-based cartoon , featuring both real-life groups ( the beatles , the jackson 5ive , and the osmonds ) as well as anonymous studio musicians ( the archies , josie and the pussycats ) the ties between the animated spin-offs and their live-action origins varied widely , depending on how much input the original cast and crew were willing to contribute ( and how much the animation companies were willing to pay for that talent ) ; in retrospect , animated versions of tv series are generally not treated as canon other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included tarzan ( tarzan , lord of the jungle ) , planet of the apes ( return to the planet of the apes ) , lassie ( lassie 's rescue rangers ) and godzilla ) most of the genres made popular in previous generations ( funny animals , superheroes , teen mysteries , science fiction and live-action adaptations ) continued to appear as well , with the exception of the musical band cartoons ( only one of note , the syndicated jem , emerged in the 1980s ) schulz 's comic strip peanuts , brought schulz 's characters to saturday mornings in the charlie brown and snoopy show ; later in the 1980s , the successful garfield comic strip and tv specials were adapted into the long-running garfield and friends , also on cbs other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included lone ranger , star wars ( star wars : droids and ewoks ) and zorro ( the new adventures of zorro ) the schoolhouse rock ! series on abc became a television classic ; abc also had several other short-form animated featurettes , including time for timer and the bod squad , that had long runs just as notable were cbs 's news segments for children , in the news and nbc 's ask nbc news and one to grow on , which featured skits of everyday problems with advice from the stars of nbc prime time programs the rise of first-run syndicated animated programs , which usually had a greater artistic freedom and looser standards than those that were mandated by a network both of these factors limited creative options and cut off large revenue sources for children 's programs on network television , and would overrun saturday-morning cartoons the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers visitation periods for the secondary custodial parent often occurred on saturday mornings and afternoons , changing the routines of these children from a steady schedule every weekend the decline of saturday-morning cartoons coincided with a rise in adult animation and a wave of new , creator-driven animation studios , which experienced a revival ( much of it on prime time television ) in the 1990s as the saturday-morning cartoons were in decline , as did animated feature films ( see , for example , the disney renaissance ) fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming , networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s ; by this point , these consisted either of re-purposed rerun from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the united states a 1996 federal communications commission mandate , issued in the wake of the regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children 's regulations on children 's television programming in the united states ( '' e/i '' ) programming per week cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002 , after cable network discovery kids ( now discovery family ) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction , beating out other children 's television companies ( notably nickelodeon , which already programmed cbs 's saturday-morning block as nickelodeon on cbs ) in 2004 , abc was the last of the broadcast networks to add a saturday-morning edition of its morning news program ( in their case , good morning america ) in the first hour of its lineup , mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the february 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster which occurred on a saturday morning , forcing them to take coverage from other video news agency several channels , while not offering original animated series , do air reruns of older saturday-morning cartoons in the 2010s , the channel 's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s ( many of which were never intended for the saturday-morning programming block ) , and as of 2014 , all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots the disney channel ( which , like abc , is owned by the walt disney company ) launched a saturday-morning block of its popular animated programming , initially named disney channel saturday morning block , in june 2011 kids ' wb debuted on the wb on september 9 , 1995 , as a block on weekday mornings , weekday afternoons and saturday mornings during the run of the weekday morning blocks , the network aired the animated series histeria !

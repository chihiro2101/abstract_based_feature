although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising furthermore , limited animation , such as that produced by such studios as filmation , depatie–freleng enterprises , total television , jay ward productions and hanna-barbera , was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot , as compared to live-action programming while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages until the late 1960s , a number of saturday-morning cartoons were rerun of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier some saturday-morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters , such as the looney tunes and merrie melodies cartoons produced by warner bros cartoons , the tom and jerry cartoons produced by metro-goldwyn-mayer and directed by william hanna and joseph barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company ; the mighty mouse and heckle and jeckle cartoons produced by paul terry 's terrytoons , and walter lantz 's woody woodpecker cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s , it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ( depatie-freleng was particularly associated with this business model ) , so that by selling the shorts to theaters , the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone , which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user the mid-1960s brought a boom in superhero cartoon series , some adapted from comic book , ( superman , aquaman , spider-man , fantastic four ) , and others original ( space ghost , the herculoids , birdman and the galaxy trio , etc another development was the popular music-based cartoon , featuring both real-life groups ( the beatles , the jackson 5ive , and the osmonds ) as well as anonymous studio musicians ( the archies , josie and the pussycats ) live-action series continued to some extent with sid and marty krofft 's h.r ) comedian bill cosby successfully blended educational elements with both comedy and music in the popular , long-running fat albert and the cosby kids ) most of the genres made popular in previous generations ( funny animals , superheroes , teen mysteries , science fiction and live-action adaptations ) continued to appear as well , with the exception of the musical band cartoons ( only one of note , the syndicated jem , emerged in the 1980s ) during the mid-1980s through the early 1990s , series featuring younger and junior versions of characters from the 1970s and earlier were introduced , such as muppet babies , a pup named scooby-doo , and the flintstone kids increasing regulation of children 's programming content , including the federal communications commission 's introduction of the e/i mandate in 1990 and later made more explicit in 1996 this required all broadcast networks to air '' educational and informational '' children 's programs for at least three hours a week the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers cable channels had the additional advantage of being beyond fcc content regulations and did not have to abide by educational and advertising regulations ; within a year of the e/i mandate being imposed , nickelodeon shot ahead of all of the broadcast networks in saturday-morning viewership ratings the strongly continuous growth of home video game systems made by atari , nintendo , sega and others the decline of saturday-morning cartoons coincided with a rise in adult animation and a wave of new , creator-driven animation studios , which experienced a revival ( much of it on prime time television ) in the 1990s as the saturday-morning cartoons were in decline , as did animated feature films ( see , for example , the disney renaissance ) a 1996 federal communications commission mandate , issued in the wake of the regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children 's regulations on children 's television programming in the united states ( '' e/i '' ) programming per week to help their network affiliates comply with the regulations , broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates , so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time , thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates nbc abandoned its original saturday-morning cartoon lineup in 1992 , replacing it with a saturday-morning edition of today and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block , tnbc , which featured saved by the bell , california dreams and other teen sitcoms cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002 , after cable network discovery kids ( now discovery family ) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction , beating out other children 's television companies ( notably nickelodeon , which already programmed cbs 's saturday-morning block as nickelodeon on cbs ) cbs followed nbc 's lead in 1997 by producing cbs news saturday morning for the first two hours of its lineup and an all live-action block of children 's programming yu-gi-oh in particular was the most popular saturday-morning cartoon during the 2000s in 2004 , abc was the last of the broadcast networks to add a saturday-morning edition of its morning news program ( in their case , good morning america ) in the first hour of its lineup , mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the february 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster which occurred on a saturday morning , forcing them to take coverage from other video news agency fox carried little or no e/i programming , leaving the responsibility of scheduling the e/i shows to the affiliates themselves ( although the network did eventually add daily reruns of the magic school bus to meet the e/i mandates from 1998 to 2001 ) following the closure of its 4kids tv block in 2008 , fox would not carry any children 's programming at all for five years until the launch of xploration station the wb was far more accommodating ; for several years , the network aired the history-themed histeria ! five days a week , leaving only a half-hour of e/i programs up to the local affiliates to program a handful of digital subchannels also make use of saturday-morning cartoon reruns , including reach high media group 's pbj and ion media 's qubo in 2011 , the major networks began to phase out weekend-morning educational programming aimed towards preteen audiences , in favor of live-action reality and docuseries outsourced to other producers on february 24 , 2016 , nbc announced a new e/i block produced by litton entertainment , the more you know—a brand extension of nbc 's public service announcement brand '' the more you know '' , and it launched on october 8 , 2016 , resulting in nbc removing all cartoons from its saturday-morning lineups for the first time since september 1992 with the purchase of dic entertainment by cookie jar group in 2008 , the block was later relaunched as the cookie jar kids network in 2009 and various additional programs from the cookie jar group catalog were added to the lineup telexitos airs both cartoons and three-hour children 's programming ; however , only two non-regulations on children 's television programming in the united states programming airs in the early morning and afternoon hours such as he-man and the masters of the universe and she-ra : princess of power

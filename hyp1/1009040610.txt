although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising furthermore , limited animation , such as that produced by such studios as filmation , depatie–freleng enterprises , total television , jay ward productions and hanna-barbera , was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot , as compared to live-action programming while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages until the late 1960s , a number of saturday-morning cartoons were rerun of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier cartoons , the tom and jerry cartoons produced by metro-goldwyn-mayer and directed by william hanna and joseph barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company ; the mighty mouse and heckle and jeckle cartoons produced by paul terry 's terrytoons , and walter lantz 's woody woodpecker cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s , it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ( depatie-freleng was particularly associated with this business model ) , so that by selling the shorts to theaters , the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone , which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user some of these legacy characters later appeared in '' new '' versions by other producers ( tom and jerry by hanna and barbera for their own company , and later by filmation ; mighty mouse by filmation and later by ralph bakshi ; the pink panther show by hanna-barbera with friz freleng as a consultant ) the remainder of the networks ' saturday-morning schedules were filled by reruns of black-and-white live-action series made in the 1950s , usually with a western background ( the lone ranger , the roy rogers show , sky king , fury , the adventures of rin tin tin , my friend flicka , etc the ties between the animated spin-offs and their live-action origins varied widely , depending on how much input the original cast and crew were willing to contribute ( and how much the animation companies were willing to pay for that talent ) ; in retrospect , animated versions of tv series are generally not treated as canon filmation , primarily a cartoon producer , also turned out several live-action saturday-morning series in the 1970s , including shazam ! ( with animated sequences ) and the secret of isis , jason of star command , the ghost busters ( not related to the ghostbusters , but a vehicle for former f troop stars larry storch and forrest tucker ) and uncle croc 's block along with the fcc 's looser interpretation of programming regulations under president reagan , this led to the era of '' half-hour toy commercials '' that became almost synonymous with '80s cartoons ) most of the genres made popular in previous generations ( funny animals , superheroes , teen mysteries , science fiction and live-action adaptations ) continued to appear as well , with the exception of the musical band cartoons ( only one of note , the syndicated jem , emerged in the 1980s ) by the 1970s , these groups exercised enough influence that the television networks felt compelled to lay down more stringent content rules for the animation houses the schoolhouse rock ! series on abc became a television classic ; abc also had several other short-form animated featurettes , including time for timer and the bod squad , that had long runs the rise of first-run syndicated animated programs , which usually had a greater artistic freedom and looser standards than those that were mandated by a network increasing regulation of children 's programming content , including the federal communications commission 's introduction of the e/i mandate in 1990 and later made more explicit in 1996 both of these factors limited creative options and cut off large revenue sources for children 's programs on network television , and would overrun saturday-morning cartoons the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers cable channels had the additional advantage of being beyond fcc content regulations and did not have to abide by educational and advertising regulations ; within a year of the e/i mandate being imposed , nickelodeon shot ahead of all of the broadcast networks in saturday-morning viewership ratings cable television was also better positioned to rerun children 's programming as another source of revenue in an increasingly fractured marketplace visitation periods for the secondary custodial parent often occurred on saturday mornings and afternoons , changing the routines of these children from a steady schedule every weekend fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming , networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s ; by this point , these consisted either of re-purposed rerun from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the united states a 1996 federal communications commission mandate , issued in the wake of the regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children 's regulations on children 's television programming in the united states ( '' e/i '' ) programming per week nbc abandoned its original saturday-morning cartoon lineup in 1992 , replacing it with a saturday-morning edition of today and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block , tnbc , which featured saved by the bell , california dreams and other teen sitcoms cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002 , after cable network discovery kids ( now discovery family ) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction , beating out other children 's television companies ( notably nickelodeon , which already programmed cbs 's saturday-morning block as nickelodeon on cbs ) in 2004 , abc was the last of the broadcast networks to add a saturday-morning edition of its morning news program ( in their case , good morning america ) in the first hour of its lineup , mainly due to internal affiliate criticism of the lack of network coverage for the february 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster which occurred on a saturday morning , forcing them to take coverage from other video news agency fox carried little or no e/i programming , leaving the responsibility of scheduling the e/i shows to the affiliates themselves ( although the network did eventually add daily reruns of the magic school bus to meet the e/i mandates from 1998 to 2001 ) following the closure of its 4kids tv block in 2008 , fox would not carry any children 's programming at all for five years until the launch of xploration station after being purchased by disney , abc 's saturday-morning cartoons became part of a block called abc kids before switching to a block of live-action and animated programs under the banner abc kids in 2002 nbc kids , which was the only and final saturday-morning programming block to air animated programming , ended its run on september 25 , 2016 with the purchase of dic entertainment by cookie jar group in 2008 , the block was later relaunched as the cookie jar kids network in 2009 and various additional programs from the cookie jar group catalog were added to the lineup on september 6 , 1999 , the block was rebranded as '' pbs kids '' and spun off into a 24-hour cable channel using the same name , which was turned into a joint venture with comcast , hit entertainment , and sesame workshop in 2005 , called pbs kids sprout , which later became simply sprout due to comcast buying full ownership of the network via nbcuniversal , eventually becoming universal kids in 2017 as of 2019 , retro carries the houndcats and the barkleys , two depatie–freleng enterprises cartoons from the 1970s , on its saturday-morning lineup in addition to its e/i liabilities animation in the united states in the television era lists of united states network television schedules list of weekday cartoons saturday morning preview specials animation

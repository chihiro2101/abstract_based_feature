although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising furthermore , limited animation , such as that produced by such studios as filmation , depatieâ€“freleng enterprises , total television , jay ward productions and hanna-barbera , was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot , as compared to live-action programming while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages until the late 1960s , a number of saturday-morning cartoons were rerun of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier some saturday-morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters , such as the looney tunes and merrie melodies cartoons produced by warner bros cartoons , the tom and jerry cartoons produced by metro-goldwyn-mayer and directed by william hanna and joseph barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company ; the mighty mouse and heckle and jeckle cartoons produced by paul terry 's terrytoons , and walter lantz 's woody woodpecker cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s , it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ( depatie-freleng was particularly associated with this business model ) , so that by selling the shorts to theaters , the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone , which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user many of these animated spin-offs featured storylines and settings that would not be feasible in most live-action series ( such as trips around the world and/or into space ) ) comedian bill cosby successfully blended educational elements with both comedy and music in the popular , long-running fat albert and the cosby kids by the 1970s , these groups exercised enough influence that the television networks felt compelled to lay down more stringent content rules for the animation houses the networks were encouraged to create educational spots that endeavored to use animation and/or live-action for enriching content the schoolhouse rock ! series on abc became a television classic ; abc also had several other short-form animated featurettes , including time for timer and the bod squad , that had long runs the decline of the timeslot somewhat began in the early 1990s for a variety of reasons , including : creative declines and stagnation at the major television animation studios ; by the late 1980s , major saturday-morning producers such as hanna-barbera and filmation had already recycled a limited number of common tropes and poorly developed stock characters numerous times over the previous two decades this required all broadcast networks to air '' educational and informational '' children 's programs for at least three hours a week both of these factors limited creative options and cut off large revenue sources for children 's programs on network television , and would overrun saturday-morning cartoons the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers cable television was also better positioned to rerun children 's programming as another source of revenue in an increasingly fractured marketplace the gradual legalization of no-fault divorce in the united states over the course of the 1970s and 1980s , which prompted a spike in divorces , and a desire for parents to make more productive use of their time with their children visitation periods for the secondary custodial parent often occurred on saturday mornings and afternoons , changing the routines of these children from a steady schedule every weekend the decline of saturday-morning cartoons coincided with a rise in adult animation and a wave of new , creator-driven animation studios , which experienced a revival ( much of it on prime time television ) in the 1990s as the saturday-morning cartoons were in decline , as did animated feature films ( see , for example , the disney renaissance ) fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming , networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s ; by this point , these consisted either of re-purposed rerun from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the united states as the popularity of these blocks continued to decline and no hit shows emerged from them , by the early 2010s cartoons began an outright phaseout , with the major networks opting to fill their educational mandates by commissioning live-action , mostly documentary/human interest series that were far less labor-intensive and expensive to produce ( and , more importantly for the networks , less restrictive in regard to commercials ) to help their network affiliates comply with the regulations , broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates , so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time , thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates this almost always meant that the educational programming was placed during the saturday-morning cartoon block nbc abandoned its original saturday-morning cartoon lineup in 1992 , replacing it with a saturday-morning edition of today and adding an all live-action teen-oriented block , tnbc , which featured saved by the bell , california dreams and other teen sitcoms even though the educational content was minimal to non-existent , nbc labeled all the live-action shows with an e/i rating and provided the legal fiction of a blanket educational summary boilerplate text provided to stations to place in their quarterly educational effort reports for the fcc cbs followed nbc 's lead in 1997 by producing cbs news saturday morning for the first two hours of its lineup and an all live-action block of children 's programming in the 2010s , the channel 's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s ( many of which were never intended for the saturday-morning programming block ) , and as of 2014 , all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots the two parties ended the nickelodeon/nick jr.-branded block , which was replaced by the dic entertainment ( now cookie jar group ) and produced cookie jar tv in september 2006 nbc entered into a partnership with digital cable and satellite network discovery kids to provide original programming from the channel on nbc 's saturday-morning lineup in 2002 , discovery kids on nbc ran on the network from september 14 , 2002 to september 2 , 2006 nbc kids , which was the only and final saturday-morning programming block to air animated programming , ended its run on september 25 , 2016 pbs has run daytime children 's programming targeted at children between the ages of 4 and 12 since the network debuted on october 5 , 1970 animation in the united states in the television era lists of united states network television schedules list of weekday cartoons saturday morning preview specials animation saturday-morning grid of 1967 , year of debut of fantastic four and spider-man tv party presents the schedules and program profiles for every series the networks broadcast on saturday mornings from the mid-sixties all through the seventies

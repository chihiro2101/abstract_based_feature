although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising furthermore , limited animation , such as that produced by such studios as filmation , depatieâ€“freleng enterprises , total television , jay ward productions and hanna-barbera , was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot , as compared to live-action programming while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages the experiment proved successful , and the time slot was filled with profitable programming until the late 1960s , a number of saturday-morning cartoons were rerun of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier some saturday-morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters , such as the looney tunes and merrie melodies cartoons produced by warner bros some of these legacy characters later appeared in '' new '' versions by other producers ( tom and jerry by hanna and barbera for their own company , and later by filmation ; mighty mouse by filmation and later by ralph bakshi ; the pink panther show by hanna-barbera with friz freleng as a consultant ) the remainder of the networks ' saturday-morning schedules were filled by reruns of black-and-white live-action series made in the 1950s , usually with a western background ( the lone ranger , the roy rogers show , sky king , fury , the adventures of rin tin tin , my friend flicka , etc ) and occasional first-run live-action series such as the magic land of allakazam , the later color episodes of howdy doody , the shari lewis show , shenanigans , and watch mr another development was the popular music-based cartoon , featuring both real-life groups ( the beatles , the jackson 5ive , and the osmonds ) as well as anonymous studio musicians ( the archies , josie and the pussycats ) at this same time , the great success of scooby-doo spawned numerous imitations , combining the archie show-style teen characters and funny animals with light-weight mystery stories ( speed buggy , jabberjaw , etc ) most of the genres made popular in previous generations ( funny animals , superheroes , teen mysteries , science fiction and live-action adaptations ) continued to appear as well , with the exception of the musical band cartoons ( only one of note , the syndicated jem , emerged in the 1980s ) cbs and the producing team of lee mendelson and bill melendez , acclaimed for their emmy award-winning prime time specials adapted from charles m just as notable were cbs 's news segments for children , in the news and nbc 's ask nbc news and one to grow on , which featured skits of everyday problems with advice from the stars of nbc prime time programs joe , the transformers , voltron , thundercats , he-man and the masters of the universe , ducktales , the first two seasons of tiny toon adventures , and the first three seasons of teenage mutant ninja turtles both of these factors limited creative options and cut off large revenue sources for children 's programs on network television , and would overrun saturday-morning cartoons the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers cable channels had the additional advantage of being beyond fcc content regulations and did not have to abide by educational and advertising regulations ; within a year of the e/i mandate being imposed , nickelodeon shot ahead of all of the broadcast networks in saturday-morning viewership ratings cable television was also better positioned to rerun children 's programming as another source of revenue in an increasingly fractured marketplace as the popularity of these blocks continued to decline and no hit shows emerged from them , by the early 2010s cartoons began an outright phaseout , with the major networks opting to fill their educational mandates by commissioning live-action , mostly documentary/human interest series that were far less labor-intensive and expensive to produce ( and , more importantly for the networks , less restrictive in regard to commercials ) a 1996 federal communications commission mandate , issued in the wake of the regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children 's regulations on children 's television programming in the united states ( '' e/i '' ) programming per week to help their network affiliates comply with the regulations , broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates , so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time , thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates cartoons returned to the network in the fall of 2002 , after cable network discovery kids ( now discovery family ) won the rights to the timeslot in an auction , beating out other children 's television companies ( notably nickelodeon , which already programmed cbs 's saturday-morning block as nickelodeon on cbs ) boomerang , a spin-off channel of cartoon network , specialized primarily in rerun of saturday-morning cartoons from the 1960s and 1970s ( the majority of which come from hanna-barbera , which , like boomerang , is owned by warnermedia ) in the 2010s , the channel 's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s ( many of which were never intended for the saturday-morning programming block ) , and as of 2014 , all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots in 2011 , the major networks began to phase out weekend-morning educational programming aimed towards preteen audiences , in favor of live-action reality and docuseries outsourced to other producers litton entertainment took over programming the saturday-morning children 's blocks from abc , cbs , the cw , and nbc in 2011 , 2013 , 2014 , and 2016 , respectively after being purchased by disney , abc 's saturday-morning cartoons became part of a block called abc kids before switching to a block of live-action and animated programs under the banner abc kids in 2002 the disney channel ( which , like abc , is owned by the walt disney company ) launched a saturday-morning block of its popular animated programming , initially named disney channel saturday morning block , in june 2011 vortexx ended its run on september 27 , 2014 , at which point the cw turned over its e/i liability and saturday-morning programming to litton as well on july 7 , 2012 , nbc launched a new saturday-morning block aimed at preschool-aged children , nbc kids , under a time lease agreement with co-owned cable network sprout ( which nbc , through corporate parent comcast , also owned a minority interest before purchasing it outright in 2013 ) the block featured mainly scripted animated and live action series ; cookie jar-produced programs that did not count towards regulations on children 's television programming in the united states quotas aired under the sub-block this is for kids an additional three-hour weekend morning block for preschool-aged children that was produced in conjunction with the canada-based animation studio nelvana called the pbs kids bookworm bunch debuted in september 30 , 2000 and ended in 2004 telexitos airs both cartoons and three-hour children 's programming ; however , only two non-regulations on children 's television programming in the united states programming airs in the early morning and afternoon hours such as he-man and the masters of the universe and she-ra : princess of power

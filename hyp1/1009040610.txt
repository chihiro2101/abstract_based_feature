although the saturday-morning timeslot had always featured a great deal of children 's television series beginning in the early 1950s , the idea of commissioning new animated series for broadcast on saturday mornings caught on in the mid-1960s , when the networks realized that they could concentrate kids ' viewing on that one morning to appeal to advertising furthermore , limited animation , such as that produced by such studios as filmation , depatie–freleng enterprises , total television , jay ward productions and hanna-barbera , was economical enough to produce in sufficient quantity to fill the four-hour time slot , as compared to live-action programming while production times and costs were undeniably higher with animated programming , the cost of talent was far less ( voice actors became known for their ability to hold several characters at once , sometimes even on the same show ) and networks could rerun children 's animated programming more frequently than most live-action series , negating the financial disadvantages until the late 1960s , a number of saturday-morning cartoons were rerun of animated series originally made for prime time during a brief flurry of such series a few years earlier these included hanna-barbera 's the flintstones , top cat , the jetsons and jonny quest , ross bagdasarian 's the alvin show , and bob clampett 's beany and cecil some saturday-morning programs consisted of telecasts of older cartoons originally made for movie theaters , such as the looney tunes and merrie melodies cartoons produced by warner bros cartoons , the tom and jerry cartoons produced by metro-goldwyn-mayer and directed by william hanna and joseph barbera for that studio prior to establishing their own company ; the mighty mouse and heckle and jeckle cartoons produced by paul terry 's terrytoons , and walter lantz 's woody woodpecker cartoons during the 1960s and 1970s , it was not uncommon to have animated shorts produced with both film and television in mind ( depatie-freleng was particularly associated with this business model ) , so that by selling the shorts to theaters , the studios could afford a higher budget than would otherwise be available from television alone , which at the time was still a free medium for the end-user some of these legacy characters later appeared in '' new '' versions by other producers ( tom and jerry by hanna and barbera for their own company , and later by filmation ; mighty mouse by filmation and later by ralph bakshi ; the pink panther show by hanna-barbera with friz freleng as a consultant ) ) and occasional first-run live-action series such as the magic land of allakazam , the later color episodes of howdy doody , the shari lewis show , shenanigans , and watch mr also included were parodies of the superhero genre ( underdog , the super 6 , and george of the jungle , among others ) the success of star wars toys convinced toy companies of the enormous profit potential in developing their own intellectual properties to base toys on along with the fcc 's looser interpretation of programming regulations under president reagan , this led to the era of '' half-hour toy commercials '' that became almost synonymous with '80s cartoons schulz 's comic strip peanuts , brought schulz 's characters to saturday mornings in the charlie brown and snoopy show ; later in the 1980s , the successful garfield comic strip and tv specials were adapted into the long-running garfield and friends , also on cbs other adaptations of familiar characters and properties included lone ranger , star wars ( star wars : droids and ewoks ) and zorro ( the new adventures of zorro ) the rise of first-run syndicated animated programs , which usually had a greater artistic freedom and looser standards than those that were mandated by a network this required all broadcast networks to air '' educational and informational '' children 's programs for at least three hours a week the rise of cable television networks such as the disney channel , nickelodeon and cartoon network , which provided appealing animated entertainment throughout the week at nearly all hours , making saturday-morning timeslots far less important to viewers and advertisers cable television was also better positioned to rerun children 's programming as another source of revenue in an increasingly fractured marketplace the increased availability of home video services ( both hard-copy and later through the internet in the form of video on demand ) , which , just like cable , allowed children to watch their favorite cartoons at any given time fueled by the continued requirement for educational programming , networks continued to carry some cartoons well into the 2000s ; by this point , these consisted either of re-purposed rerun from cable or outsourced blocks of cartoons imported from outside the united states a 1996 federal communications commission mandate , issued in the wake of the regulations on children 's television programming in the united states , requires that stations program a minimum of three hours of children 's regulations on children 's television programming in the united states ( '' e/i '' ) programming per week to help their network affiliates comply with the regulations , broadcast networks began to reorganize their efforts to adhere to the mandates , so their affiliates would not bear the burden of scheduling the shows themselves on their own time , thus eliminating the risk of having network product preempted by the mandates in the 1990s , television in japan shows targeted towards children and teenagers were introduced to american television , including live-action tokusatsu superhero shows such as power rangers ( super sentai ) and vr troopers ( metal hero series ) , and anime shows such as pokémon , dragon ball , sailor moon , digimon and yu-gi-oh ! this led to a transition in the saturday-morning slot from traditional american saturday-morning cartoons towards japanese anime , which have dominated the saturday-morning timeslot since the 1990s fox carried little or no e/i programming , leaving the responsibility of scheduling the e/i shows to the affiliates themselves ( although the network did eventually add daily reruns of the magic school bus to meet the e/i mandates from 1998 to 2001 ) the wb was far more accommodating ; for several years , the network aired the history-themed histeria ! five days a week , leaving only a half-hour of e/i programs up to the local affiliates to program in the 2010s , the channel 's focus shifted toward airing reruns of cancelled animated series from the 1990s and 2000s ( many of which were never intended for the saturday-morning programming block ) , and as of 2014 , all earlier cartoons are relegated to graveyard slots in 2011 , the major networks began to phase out weekend-morning educational programming aimed towards preteen audiences , in favor of live-action reality and docuseries outsourced to other producers during the run of the weekday morning blocks , the network aired the animated series histeria ! to meet regulations on children 's television programming in the united states content quotas for the network 's affiliates the kids ' wb weekday morning block ended in 2001 , while the weekday afternoon block was discontinued on december 30 , 2005 with the wb retaining the two afternoon hours to run a lineup of off-network syndicated reruns the block featured mainly scripted animated and live action series ;

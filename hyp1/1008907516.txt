despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers the first commercial application of ivr was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by steven schmidt in 1973 early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems with improvements in technology , systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use dtmf signaling starting in the 2000s , voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts dtmf tones are entered via the telephone keypad ivr technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue higher level ivr development tools are available to further simplify the application development process ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost the use of ivr allows callers ' queries to be resolved without a live agent a single large ivr system can handle calls for thousands of applications , each with its own phone numbers and script call centers use ivr systems to identify and segment callers ivr systems allow callers to obtain data relatively anonymously ivr manufacturers have extended their systems into ivvr ( interactive voice and video response ) , especially for the mobile phone networks the introduction of full-duplex video ivr in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center

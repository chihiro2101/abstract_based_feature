despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies at that time , a system could store digitized speech on disk , play the appropriate spoken message , and process the human 's dtmf response as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts ivr technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation an ivr can play announcements and request an input from the caller this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost when an ivr system answers multiple phone numbers , the use of dnis ensures that the correct application and language is executed a single large ivr system can handle calls for thousands of applications , each with its own phone numbers and script call centers use ivr systems to identify and segment callers the system may obtain caller line identification ( cli ) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller in a system wherein individual customers may have a different status , the service will automatically prioritize the individual 's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue ivrs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing , performance report , and future ivr system enhancements this is information that could easily be handled by a person but the ivr system is used to preserve privacy and avoid potential embarrassment of sensitive information or test results developing countries have a prevalence of mobile phones even in rural areas , which allows room for ivr technology to support social good projects ivr manufacturers have extended their systems into ivvr ( interactive voice and video response ) , especially for the mobile phone networks ivr technology is being used to automate im conversations using existing natural language processing software with the introduction of web services into the contact center , host integration has been simplified , allowing ivr applications to be hosted remotely from the contact center it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center

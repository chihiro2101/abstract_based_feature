despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers the first commercial application of ivr was an order entry inventory control system designed and developed by steven schmidt in 1973 early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems with improvements in technology , systems could use speaker-independent voice recognition of a limited vocabulary instead of requiring the person to use dtmf signaling starting in the 2000s , voice response became more common and cheaper to deploy dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts ivr technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation an ivr can play announcements and request an input from the caller ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller answers to simple questions such as account balances or pre-recorded information can be provided without operator intervention ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue say something like , account balance , order status , or more options '' ) with an open-ended prompt , however , the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases ( e.g arus increase the number of information calls handled and provide consistent quality in information retrieval ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost the use of ivr allows callers ' queries to be resolved without a live agent when an ivr system answers multiple phone numbers , the use of dnis ensures that the correct application and language is executed a single large ivr system can handle calls for thousands of applications , each with its own phone numbers and script call centers use ivr systems to identify and segment callers the use of video gives ivr systems the ability to implement multimodal interaction with the caller ivr applications can also be hosted on the public network , without contact center integration it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center ivr has historically received criticism for its difficulty of use and a lack of appreciation of the caller 's needs as well as objections to providing a voice response to an automated system

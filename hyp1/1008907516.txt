despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems ivr became vital for call centers deploying universal queuing and routing solutions and acted as an agent which collected customer data to enable intelligent routing decisions dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts other technologies include using text-to-speech ( tts ) to speak complex and dynamic information , such as e-mails , news reports or weather information an ivr can play announcements and request an input from the caller this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record the ability to use xml-driven applications allows a web server to act as the application server , freeing the ivr developer to focus on the call flow ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue an open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses ( e.g the open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of natural language processing to extract the relevant information from the phrase ( i.e a mixed dialogue approach involves shifting from open-ended to directed dialogue or vice versa within the same interaction , as one type of prompt may be more effective in a given situation higher level ivr development tools are available to further simplify the application development process ivrs will also log call detail information into its own database for auditing , performance report , and future ivr system enhancements cti can transfer relevant information about the individual customer and the ivr dialog from the ivr to the agent desktop using a screen pop , making for a more effective and efficient service ivr can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller ivr systems are used by pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations to conduct clinical trials and manage the large volumes of data generated however , most ivr technology is designed in resource-rich domains hence research is necessary to contextualize and adapt this technology for developing countries the introduction of full-duplex video ivr in the future will allow systems the ability to read emotions and facial expressions ivr applications can also be hosted on the public network , without contact center integration however , modern ivr systems are able to include caller context and provide personalized options

despite the increase in ivr technology during the 1970s , the technology was considered complex and expensive for automating tasks in call centers early voice response systems were dsp technology based and limited to small vocabularies as call centers began to migrate to multimedia in the late 1990s , companies started to invest in computer telephony integration ( cti ) with ivr systems dtmf decoding and speech recognition are used to interpret the caller 's response to voice prompts ivr technology is also being introduced into automobile systems for hands-free operation tts is computer generated synthesized speech that is no longer the robotic voice traditionally associated with computers an ivr can play announcements and request an input from the caller this information can be used to profile the caller and route the call to an agent with a particular skill set ) interactive voice response can be used to front-end a call center operation by identifying the needs of the caller account numbers from the ivr are often compared to caller id data for security reasons and additional ivr responses are required if the caller id does not match the account record ivr speech recognition interactions ( call flows ) are designed using 3 approaches to prompt for and recognize user input : directed , open-ended , and mixed dialogue a directed dialogue prompt communicates a set of valid responses to the user ( e.g an open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses ( e.g open-ended recognition also requires a larger grammar set , which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response ( e.g a call flow diagram can be drawn with a gui tool and the presentation layer ( typically voicexml ) can be automatically generated ivr systems are used to service high call volumes at lower cost a single large ivr system can handle calls for thousands of applications , each with its own phone numbers and script call centers use ivr systems to identify and segment callers cti allows a contact center or organization to gather information about the caller as a means of directing the inquiry to the appropriate agent ivr can be used to provide a more sophisticated voice mail experience to the caller ivr manufacturers have extended their systems into ivvr ( interactive voice and video response ) , especially for the mobile phone networks as calls are queued in the sip contact center , the ivr system can provide treatment or automation , wait for a fixed period , or play music ivr technology is being used to automate im conversations using existing natural language processing software it is also possible to deploy two-prong ivr services where the initial ivr application is used to route the call to the appropriate contact center

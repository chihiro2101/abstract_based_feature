it would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s ( gollwitzer 1990 , 2012 ) the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g and ussr , which included absolute trust in two-player game theory , in the integrity of command chain , in control of nuclear materials , and in the mutual assured destruction of both in the case of war although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction he recounts the example of american indians , who were meant to undergo a reeducation process meant to imbue a modern '' life-plan '' that aimed for a house and a richness expressed by a filled bank account firstly , an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole , but maybe even more importantly , it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu , allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy the mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by sagive and schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of mindset agency theory similar to the mbti , the mindscapes of maruyama seek to measure individuals on a scale of characteristics and placed into four categories of personalities that make up the population of the world hierarchical bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection fixed and growth mindset according to carol dweck , individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of '' where ability comes from '' dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking one of the ways educators can do this is by creating a growth-mindset culture in their classroom that provides the right kind of praise and encouragement according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' students who are engaged in more challenging learning activities , have more opportunities to make mistakes and struggle , allowing the teacher to interject with some new strategies to try while praising students for the work they have done so far in a recent study by hussein ( 2018 ) , the effects of reflective journal writing on students ' growth mindset was examined the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom hattie ( 2012 ) states , '' differing mindsets , or assumptions , that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations , teaching practices , and how students perceive their own mindset the growth mindset intervention halted the students ' decline in grades and started the students on a new pathway of improvement and high achievement '' ( boaler , 2013 ) he argues that mindsets guide people 's thinking and behavior and play a key role in people 's life experiences , development journey , and wellbeing originating from the study of organizational leadership and coinciding with the growth of multinational corporations in the 1980s , organizations observed that the effectiveness of their executives did not necessarily translate cross-culturally according to chris argyris ( 2004 ) , there are two dominant mindsets in organizations : the productive mindset and the defensive mindset when this mindset is active , people or organizations only seek out information that will protect them

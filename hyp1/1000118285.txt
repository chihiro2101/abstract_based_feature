it would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s ( gollwitzer 1990 , 2012 ) the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g a well-known example is the '' cold war mindset '' prevalent in both the u.s although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction naturally , the question regarding the embodiment of a collective mindset comes to mind this variation includes how to define , measure , and conceptualize a mindset as well as the types of mindset identified hierarchical bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection fixed and growth mindset according to carol dweck , individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of '' where ability comes from '' dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study in particular , an individual 's mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges , such as the transition into junior high school from elementary school or losing your job according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking one of the ways educators can do this is by creating a growth-mindset culture in their classroom that provides the right kind of praise and encouragement according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' as such , it is important for educators to carefully craft and design meaningful learning activities for their students to engage in the classroom a second strategy to promote a growth-mindset culture in the classroom is to explicitly teach lessons related to what it means to adopt a growth mindset in a recent study by hussein ( 2018 ) , the effects of reflective journal writing on students ' growth mindset was examined the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom while elements of our personality – such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks – can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset , we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions this suggests the need for more teacher training and support in order for teachers to be able to successfully implement growth mindset initiatives in their classrooms boaler uses carol dweck 's research showing that '' gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students '' ( boaler , 2013 ) boaler said , '' the key growth mindset message was that effort changes the brain by forming new connections , and that students control this process those with abundance mindset believe that there are enough resources for everyone , while those with the scarcity mindset believe that there is a limited number of resources and that zero-sum game , leading to competition for resources the defensive mindset may lead to learning based on false assumptions or prevent learning altogether ( argyris , 2004 )

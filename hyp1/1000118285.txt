it would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s ( gollwitzer 1990 , 2012 ) the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a well-known example is the '' cold war mindset '' prevalent in both the u.s and ussr , which included absolute trust in two-player game theory , in the integrity of command chain , in control of nuclear materials , and in the mutual assured destruction of both in the case of war although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group 's own mindset for example , the variations in mindset between democratic party and republican party presidents in the u.s naturally , the question regarding the embodiment of a collective mindset comes to mind there is a double relation between the institution embodying for example an entrepreneurial mindset and its entrepreneurial performance firstly , an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole , but maybe even more importantly , it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu , allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities as previously alluded to , there is a great deal of variation within the study of mindsets this variation includes how to define , measure , and conceptualize a mindset as well as the types of mindset identified even amongst scholars within the same disciple studying the same mindset , substantial variations exist ( french , 2016 ) mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality the mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by sagive and schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of mindset agency theory hierarchical bureaucrats generally view the world as having natural order with competition and consequences much like natural selection these dimensions contain opposites in the realms of cognitive , figurative , and operative values : cognitive : embeddedness or autonomy figurative : mastery or harmony operative : hierarchy or egalitarian dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure dweck argues that the growth mindset '' will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life '' despite whatever lack of success they may have , this individual would appreciate the opportunity to learn from such difficulty and gain knowledge , instead of feeling defeated about any incompleteness or lack of success a large part of dweck 's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education , and how these mindsets affect a student 's performance in the classroom in order for students to effectively adopt a growth mindset , a classroom culture needs to be established that nurtures this type of thinking one of the ways educators can do this is by creating a growth-mindset culture in their classroom that provides the right kind of praise and encouragement the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom these studies all demonstrate how framing and discussing students ' work and effort play a considerable role in the type of mindset students develop and students ' conceptions of their own ability hattie ( 2012 ) states , '' differing mindsets , or assumptions , that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations , teaching practices , and how students perceive their own mindset the first finding was that teachers ' prior beliefs about learning and learners influenced how they engaged with these mindsets boaler uses carol dweck 's research showing that '' gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students '' ( boaler , 2013 ) this is the mindset in which boaler and dweck believe people can gain knowledge in 2015 , ashley buchanan proposed a complementary evolution to the fixed and growth mindset called the benefit mindset the defensive mindset may lead to learning based on false assumptions or prevent learning altogether ( argyris , 2004 ) bounded rationality elitism ethical egoism and good and evil game theory property dualism rational irrationality mindset theory of action phases

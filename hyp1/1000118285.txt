the attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated in addition to the field of cognitive psychology , the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields ( e.g a characteristic of this area of study , in all its various manifestations , is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy ( e.g a well-known example is the '' cold war mindset '' prevalent in both the u.s although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country , the assumptions underlying deterrence theory have made assessments of the efficacy of the cold war mindset a matter of some controversy according to these commentators , power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity can not hold power indefinitely , as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events may have made that country more able to challenge assumptions than the kremlin with its more static bureaucracy modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with asymmetric warfare , terrorism , and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction erikson writes that the indians ' collective historic identity as buffalo hunters was oriented around such fundamentally different reasons/goals that even communication about the divergent '' life plans '' was itself difficult firstly , an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole , but maybe even more importantly , it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu , allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities nevertheless , any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous , varied , and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy mindset theory , as based on the cultural values defined by sagiv and schwarts , explains the nature , functions , and variables that make up the characteristics of personality the mindscape theory and cultural values outlined by sagive and schwarts combine to make a more comprehensive whole of mindset agency theory generative revolutionaries view the world as potential for growth through interaction and symbiosis ; change is encouraged these dimensions contain opposites in the realms of cognitive , figurative , and operative values : cognitive : embeddedness or autonomy figurative : mastery or harmony operative : hierarchy or egalitarian fixed and growth mindset dweck states that there are two categories ( growth mindset versus fixed mindset ) that can group individuals based on their behaviour , specifically their reaction to failure people with a '' fixed mindset '' believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities , while those with a '' growth mindset '' believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study according to dweck , individuals with a '' growth '' mindset are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks in a 2012 interview , dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets : an example of a person with a growth mindset is an employee who , when posed with an extraordinarily challenging assignment , takes the project as a growing opportunity instead of one that will defeat them despite whatever lack of success they may have , this individual would appreciate the opportunity to learn from such difficulty and gain knowledge , instead of feeling defeated about any incompleteness or lack of success according to dweck ( 2010 ) , '' praising students for the process they have engaged in—the effort they applied , the strategies they used , the choices they made , the persistence they displayed , and so on—yields more long-term benefits than telling them they are 'smart ' when they succeed '' students who are engaged in more challenging learning activities , have more opportunities to make mistakes and struggle , allowing the teacher to interject with some new strategies to try while praising students for the work they have done so far in a recent study by hussein ( 2018 ) , the effects of reflective journal writing on students ' growth mindset was examined it was found that the use of journaling could positively affect a student 's learning process by improving their conceptual knowledge , promoting growth mindset , and enhancing understanding of their thoughts through writing the way educators evaluate their students ' work and communicate their progress can also contribute to the establishment of a growth mindset culture in the classroom more specifically , dweck ( 2010 ) identifies the word '' yet '' as a valuable tool to assess students learning while a great deal of research in the education field has focused on a students ability to adopt a growth mindset , less attention and focus has been given to teacher mindsets and the role they play in influencing their students hattie ( 2012 ) states , '' differing mindsets , or assumptions , that teachers possess about themselves and their students play a significant role in determining their expectations , teaching practices , and how students perceive their own mindset secondly , it was found that many teachers tended to oversimplify the concepts of a growth and fixed mindset into positive and negative traits this suggests the need for more teacher training and support in order for teachers to be able to successfully implement growth mindset initiatives in their classrooms a study conducted by seaton ( 2018 ) , looked specifically at the impact of teacher training aimed at influencing their mindsets and the effect on their resulting practice this study reinforces the bond between a teacher 's own beliefs and how they can strongly influence the mindset of his/her students ; therefore , further highlighting the need for proper teacher training in order for mindset initiatives within schools to be fully successful according to chris argyris ( 2004 ) , there are two dominant mindsets in organizations : the productive mindset and the defensive mindset

the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt never bury hot coals , as they can continue to burn and cause root fires or wildfires be aware of roots if digging a hole for your fire making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters a few decent natural tinders are cotton , birch bark , cedar bark , and fatwood , where available ; followed by dead , dry pine needles or grass ; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on tinder though not natural steel wool make excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint , or a 9 volt battery without difficulty kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood a quantity of kindling sufficient to fill a hat may be enough , but more is better a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one timber ranges from small logs two or three inches ( 76 & nbsp ; mm ) across to larger logs that can burn for hours however , untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it ) then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling , taking care not to collapse the tipi tipi fires are excellent for producing heat to keep people warm one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over the kindling is then stacked around it , as in the construction of a log cabin the first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other , on opposite sides of the tinder pile however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware when it is burning briskly , it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder , and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs eventually , a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuelwood , and soon the logs catch fire from it its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces if built on a large scale , this type of fire-build collapses in a controlled manner without restricting the airflow once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions a lean-to fire-build starts with the same pile of tinder as the tipi fire-build the smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the tinder is enclosed between them in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile traditionally , whole un-split tree trunks provide the fuelwood outdoor youth organizations often build these fires for '' council fires '' or ceremonial fires once large kindling is burning , all kindling is placed in the fire , then the fuel wood is placed on top of it ( unless , as in the rakovalkea fire-build , it is already there ) another traditional campfire activity involves impaling marshmallows on sticks or uncoiled wire coat hangers , and roasting them over the fire this latter threat is less likely , but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment , and may spread more quickly than a ground fire camping campfire story colored fire fire pan outdoor cooking

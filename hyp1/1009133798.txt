nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire microscopic analysis of plant ash and charred bone fragments suggests that materials in the cave were not heated above about the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire minimizing the size of the fire to prevent problems from occurring making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters tinder lights easily and is used to start an enduring campfire though not natural steel wool make excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint , or a 9 volt battery without difficulty kindling wood is an arbitrary classification including anything bigger than tinder but smaller than fuel wood a quantity of kindling sufficient to fill a hat may be enough , but more is better a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one a tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks , so a clove hitch should suffice ) then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling , taking care not to collapse the tipi a separate tipi as a shell around the first one may work better a log cabin fire-build likewise begins with a tinder pile the kindling is then stacked around it , as in the construction of a log cabin the second pair is laid on top of the first , at right angles to it , and also on opposite sides of the tinder a variation on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuelwood with a pile of tinder between them , and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs , above the tinder the tinder is lit , and the kindling is allowed to catch fire its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it this fire structure combines benefits of both fire types : the tipi allows the fire to ignite easily and the log cabin sustains the fire for a long time a cross-fire is built by positioning two pieces of wood with the tinder in between once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions this type of fire creates coals suitable for cooking in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile a keyhole fire is made in a keyhole-shaped fire ring , and is used in cooking a small , enclosed fire that has slowed down may require vigorous blowing to get it going again , but excess blowing can extinguish a fire beside the danger of people receiving burns from the fire or embers , campfires may spread into a larger fire camping campfire story colored fire fire pan outdoor cooking

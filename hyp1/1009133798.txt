nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire microscopic analysis of plant ash and charred bone fragments suggests that materials in the cave were not heated above about this is consistent with preliminary findings that the fires burned grasses , brush , and leaves the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire flying embers are still a threat , and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it , or the heat the water to a vapor thereby cracking the rocks when extinguishing a campfire , using plenty of water or dirt , then stirring the mixture and add more water , then check that there are no burning embers left whatsoever making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters the tinder of choice before matches and lighters was amadou next to flint and steel though not natural steel wool make excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint , or a 9 volt battery without difficulty a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one heat-treated wood such as kiln-dried lumber is safe to transport in the united states , areas that allow camping , like state parks and national parks , often let campers collect firewood lying on the ground if they have erosion problems from campgrounds near dunes often , charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol will be used to start the fire , as well as various types of scrap paper the first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other , on opposite sides of the tinder pile the second pair is laid on top of the first , at right angles to it , and also on opposite sides of the tinder however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces this fire structure combines benefits of both fire types : the tipi allows the fire to ignite easily and the log cabin sustains the fire for a long time a cross-fire is built by positioning two pieces of wood with the tinder in between once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile the tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts near the ends do not burn prematurely the arrangement is also useful as beacon fire , i.e the swedish torch ( schwedenfackel or schwedenfeuer ) is also known by other names , including swedish ( log ) candle , and swedish log stove metal fire rings generally do a good job of keeping out wind , but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire beside the danger of people receiving burns from the fire or embers , campfires may spread into a larger fire to properly cool a fire , water is splashed on all embers , including places that are not glowing red once the fire is covered thoroughly with sand , water is then added over the fire

nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire flying embers are still a threat , and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it , or the heat the water to a vapor thereby cracking the rocks as such , it is important for the fire builder to take multiple safety precautions , including : avoiding building campfires under hanging branches or over steep slopes , and clear a ten-foot diameter circle around the fire of all flammable debris having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt never bury hot coals , as they can continue to burn and cause root fires or wildfires making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters it is anything that can be lit with a spark and is usually classified as being thinner than your little finger a faggot is a related term indicating a bundle of small branches used to feed a small fire or continue developing a bigger fire out of a small one however , untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it in the united states , areas that allow camping , like state parks and national parks , often let campers collect firewood lying on the ground in most realistic cases nowadays , non-natural additions to the fuels mentioned above will be used often , charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol will be used to start the fire , as well as various types of scrap paper there are a variety of designs to choose from in building a campfire a tripod lashing is quite difficult to execute with small sticks , so a clove hitch should suffice the first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other , on opposite sides of the tinder pile more kindling is added in the same manner however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions this method is useful in very high winds , as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak the tinder is always lit at the center so the bolstering posts near the ends do not burn prematurely first , it burns slowly but steadily when lit ; it does not require arduous maintenance , but burns for a very long time the arrangement is also useful as beacon fire , i.e the log is either cut ( usually only partially , but other variants do include totally splitting ) and then set upright ( ideally , the log needs to be cut evenly and on a level surface for stability ) a '' top lighter '' fire is built similar to a log cabin or pyre , but instead of the tinder and kindling being placed inside the cabin , it is placed in a tipi on top in effect , the fire is '' off the ground '' , and burns its way down through its course once large kindling is burning , all kindling is placed in the fire , then the fuel wood is placed on top of it ( unless , as in the rakovalkea fire-build , it is already there ) dead leaf or pine needles on the ground may ignite from direct contact with burning wood , or from thermal radiation this latter threat is less likely , but a fire in a branch is extremely difficult to put out without firefighting equipment , and may spread more quickly than a ground fire camping campfire story colored fire fire pan outdoor cooking

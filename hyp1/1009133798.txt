nearby evidence within wonderwerk cave , at the edge of the kalahari desert , has been called the oldest known controlled fire the data suggests humans were cooking prey by campfire as far back as the first appearance of homo erectus 1.9 million years ago ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches a ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt when extinguishing a campfire , using plenty of water or dirt , then stirring the mixture and add more water , then check that there are no burning embers left whatsoever be aware of roots if digging a hole for your fire making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day though not natural steel wool make excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint , or a 9 volt battery without difficulty timber ranges from small logs two or three inches ( 76 & nbsp ; mm ) across to larger logs that can burn for hours often , charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol will be used to start the fire , as well as various types of scrap paper a functional design is important in the early stages of a fire most of them make no mention of fuelwoodâ€”in most designs , fuelwood is never placed on a fire until the kindling is burning strongly ) then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling , taking care not to collapse the tipi this is especially concerning with a large fire the kindling is then stacked around it , as in the construction of a log cabin more kindling is added in the same manner however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware a variation on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuelwood with a pile of tinder between them , and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs , above the tinder the tinder is lit , and the kindling is allowed to catch fire when it is burning briskly , it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder , and the larger kindling is placed over the top of the logs this fire structure combines benefits of both fire types : the tipi allows the fire to ignite easily and the log cabin sustains the fire for a long time once the fire is burning well , additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions then , a long , thick piece of kindling is driven into the ground at an angle , so that it overhangs the tinder pile in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuelwood , and the other resting on the ground so that the kindling is leaning over the tinder pile the arrangement is also useful as beacon fire , i.e the fire burns from the top down , with the layer of hot coals and burning stubs igniting the next layer down a star fire , or indian fire , is the fire design often depicted as the campfire of the old west metal fire rings generally do a good job of keeping out wind , but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire once large kindling is burning , all kindling is placed in the fire , then the fuel wood is placed on top of it ( unless , as in the rakovalkea fire-build , it is already there ) beside the danger of people receiving burns from the fire or embers , campfires may spread into a larger fire camping campfire story colored fire fire pan outdoor cooking

microscopic analysis of plant ash and charred bone fragments suggests that materials in the cave were not heated above about such fuel would not produce hotter flames ideally , campfires should be made in a fire ring if a fire ring is not available , a temporary fire site may be constructed alternatively , turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage another way is to cover the ground with sand , or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material , to a depth of a few inches fire rings , however , do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire having enough water nearby and a shovel to smother an out-of-control fire with dirt never leaving a campfire unattended when extinguishing a campfire , using plenty of water or dirt , then stirring the mixture and add more water , then check that there are no burning embers left whatsoever be aware of roots if digging a hole for your fire making sure the fire pit is large enough for the campfire and there are no combustibles near the campfire , and avoiding the construction of the campfire on a windy day there are , by conventional classification , three types of material involved in building a fire without manufactured fuels or modern conveniences such as lighters tinder lights easily and is used to start an enduring campfire though not natural steel wool make excellent tinder and can be started with steel and flint , or a 9 volt battery without difficulty a quantity of kindling sufficient to fill a hat may be enough , but more is better in heavily used campsites , fuel wood can be hard to find , so it may have to purchased at a nearby store or be brought from home however , untreated wood should not be transported due to the probability that invasive species of bugs will be transported with it often , charcoal lighters like hexamine fuel tablets or ethyl alcohol will be used to start the fire , as well as various types of scrap paper ( synthetic rope should be avoided since it produces pollutants when it burns ) then the larger kindling is arranged above the smaller kindling , taking care not to collapse the tipi one downside to a tipi fire is that when it burns , the logs become unstable and can fall over of all the fire-builds , the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse , but it is also inefficient because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel however , these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware the tinder is lit , and the kindling is allowed to catch fire eventually , a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuelwood , and soon the logs catch fire from it another variation is called the funeral pyre method because it is used for building funeral pyres its main difference from the standard log cabin is that it starts with thin pieces and moves up to thick pieces a hybrid fire combines the elements of both the tipi and the log cabin creating an easily lit yet stable fire structure the hybrid is made by first erecting a small tipi and then proceeding to construct a log cabin around it this fire structure combines benefits of both fire types : the tipi allows the fire to ignite easily and the log cabin sustains the fire for a long time a cross-fire is built by positioning two pieces of wood with the tinder in between in an alternative method , a large piece of fuelwood or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuelwood , and the other resting on the ground so that the kindling is leaning over the tinder pile they also do not throw off much heat , which is n't needed for a ceremonial fire a star fire , or indian fire , is the fire design often depicted as the campfire of the old west camping campfire story colored fire fire pan outdoor cooking

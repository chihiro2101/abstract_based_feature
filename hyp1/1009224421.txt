the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh since its introduction in 1992 humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent , and in this context is referred to as hgh gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary , free fatty acids ) of gh secretion somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus the largest and most predictable of these gh peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 & nbsp ; ng/ml young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day like most other protein hormones , gh acts by interacting with a specific receptor on the surface of cells thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin additional igf-1 is generated within target tissues , making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone the most common disease of gh excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary these somatotroph adenomas are benign and grow slowly , gradually producing more and more gh for years , the principal clinical problems are those of gh excess eventually , the adenoma may become large enough to cause headaches , impair vision by pressure on the optic nerves , or cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones by displacement the effects of growth hormone deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) one version of rhgh has also been fda approved for maintaining muscle mass in wasting due to aids off-label prescription of hgh is controversial and may be illegal code § 333 - penalties the drug enforcement administration of the us department of justice considers off-label prescribing of hgh to be illegal , and to be a key path for illicit distribution of hgh in the united states , gh is legally available only by prescription from a medical doctor the use of gh in poultry farming is illegal in the united states prior to its production by recombinant dna technology , growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s

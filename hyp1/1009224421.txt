the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature since its introduction in 1992 humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent , and in this context is referred to as hgh gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons it appears that , in structure , gh is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus the plasma concentration of gh during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 & nbsp ; ng/ml sleep deprivation generally suppresses gh release , particularly after early adulthood thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin the liver is a major target organ of gh for this process and is the principal site of igf-1 production additional igf-1 is generated within target tissues , making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone the most common disease of gh excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary for years , the principal clinical problems are those of gh excess it is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood , but , when it does , the excessive gh can cause excessive growth , traditionally referred to as gigantism the effects of growth hormone deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity while gh replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of gh deficiency , the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that gh had reversed the aging process itself , their results were misinterpreted as indicating that gh is an effective anti-aging agent gh may also be a risk factor for hodgkin 's lymphoma athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance prior to its production by recombinant dna technology , growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s

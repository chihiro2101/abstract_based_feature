the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g the largest and most predictable of these gh peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72 & nbsp ; ng/ml the plasma concentration of gh during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 & nbsp ; ng/ml between the peaks , basal gh levels are low , usually less than 5 & nbsp ; ng/ml for most of the day and night additional analysis of the pulsatile profile of gh described in all cases less than 1 & nbsp ; ng/ml for basal levels while maximum peaks were situated around 10-20 & nbsp ; ng/ml young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin the most common disease of gh excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary these somatotroph adenomas are benign and grow slowly , gradually producing more and more gh prolonged gh excess thickens the bones of the jaw , fingers and toes , resulting heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits , referred to as acromegaly the effects of growth hormone deficiency vary depending on the age at which they occur alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms ; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin , or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity while gh replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of gh deficiency , the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown gh in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of gh deficiency despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that gh had reversed the aging process itself , their results were misinterpreted as indicating that gh is an effective anti-aging agent some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes however , because gh is a potent endogenous protein , it is very difficult to detect gh doping very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an old world monkey , the rhesus macaque , were conducted by john c this was most marked with the human growth hormone in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s

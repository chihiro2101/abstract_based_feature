the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh since its introduction in 1992 humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent , and in this context is referred to as hgh genes for human growth hormone , known as growth hormone 1 ( somatotropin ; pituitary growth hormone ) and growth hormone 2 ( placental growth hormone ; growth hormone variant ) , are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to somatomammotropin ( also known as placental lactogen ) genes gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor several molecule isoforms of gh exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus the plasma concentration of gh during these peaks may range from 5 to even 45 & nbsp ; ng/ml between the peaks , basal gh levels are low , usually less than 5 & nbsp ; ng/ml for most of the day and night a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin the liver is a major target organ of gh for this process and is the principal site of igf-1 production major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity while gh replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of gh deficiency , the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown gh in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of gh deficiency treatment with exogenous gh is indicated only in limited circumstances , and needs regular monitoring due to the frequency and severity of side-effects gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength , which led them to believe that gh merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth many athletic societies ban the use of gh and will issue sanctions against athletes who are caught using it prior to its production by recombinant dna technology , growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers no change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s

the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh since its introduction in 1992 humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent , and in this context is referred to as hgh gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor several molecule isoforms of gh exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g somatotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland then synthesize and secrete gh in a pulsatile manner , in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus between the peaks , basal gh levels are low , usually less than 5 & nbsp ; ng/ml for most of the day and night a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as anabolic ( building up ) through this mechanism gh directly stimulates division and multiplication of chondrocytes of cartilage gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin additional igf-1 is generated within target tissues , making it what appears to be both an endocrine and an autocrine/paracrine hormone it is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood , but , when it does , the excessive gh can cause excessive growth , traditionally referred to as gigantism in some circumstances , focused radiation or a gh antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function other drugs like octreotide ( somatostatin agonist ) and bromocriptine ( dopamine agonist ) can be used to block gh secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit ghrh-mediated gh release from the anterior pituitary alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms ; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin , or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin diagnosis of gh deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process , usually culminating in gh stimulation tests to see if the patient 's pituitary gland will release a pulse of gh when provoked by various stimuli gh has also been studied in the context of cognitive function , including learning and memory gh is used as replacement therapy in adults with gh deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset ( usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor ) gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance the use of gh in poultry farming is illegal in the united states

the names somatotropin ( sth ) or somatotropic hormone refer to the growth hormone produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hgh the main growth hormone produced by recombinant dna technology has the approved generic name ( inn ) somatropin and the brand name humatrope , and is properly abbreviated rhgh in the scientific literature genes for human growth hormone , known as growth hormone 1 ( somatotropin ; pituitary growth hormone ) and growth hormone 2 ( placental growth hormone ; growth hormone variant ) , are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17 and are closely related to somatomammotropin ( also known as placental lactogen ) genes gh , human chorionic somatomammotropin , and prolactin belong to somatotropin family with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity the major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species , only human and old world monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the human growth hormone receptor furthermore , these variants circulate partially bound to a protein ( growth hormone-binding protein , ghbp ) , which is the truncated part of the growth hormone receptor , and an acid-labile subunit ( als ) secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) in the pituitary is regulated by the neurosecretion nuclei of the hypothalamus these cells release the peptides growth hormone-releasing hormone ( ghrh or somatocrinin ) and somatostatin ( ghih or somatostatin ) into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary gh release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides , which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators ( e.g a number of factors are known to affect gh secretion , such as age , sex , diet , exercise , stress , and other hormones young adolescents secrete gh at the rate of about 700 μg/day , while healthy adults secrete gh at the rate of about 400 μg/day height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms : because polypeptide hormones are not fat-soluble , they can not penetrate cell membranes thus , gh exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells , where it activates the mapk/erk pathway gh also stimulates , through the jak-stat signaling pathway , the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 , formerly known as somatomedin c ) , a hormone homologous to proinsulin the liver is a major target organ of gh for this process and is the principal site of igf-1 production the most common disease of gh excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary other drugs like octreotide ( somatostatin agonist ) and bromocriptine ( dopamine agonist ) can be used to block gh secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit ghrh-mediated gh release from the anterior pituitary alterations in somatomedin can result in growth hormone deficiency with two known mechanisms ; failure of tissues to respond to somatomedin , or failure of the liver to produce somatomedin major manifestations of gh deficiency in children are growth failure , the development of a short stature , and delayed sexual maturity diagnosis of gh deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process , usually culminating in gh stimulation tests to see if the patient 's pituitary gland will release a pulse of gh when provoked by various stimuli while gh replacement therapy has been proposed to treat depression as a result of gh deficiency , the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown gh can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in gh code § 333 - penalties the drug enforcement administration of the us department of justice considers off-label prescribing of hgh to be illegal , and to be a key path for illicit distribution of hgh some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes in the united states , it is legal to give a bovine gh to dairy cows to increase milk production , and is legal to use gh in raising cows for beef ; see article on bovine somatotropin , cattle feeding , dairy farming and the beef hormone controversy very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an old world monkey , the rhesus macaque , were conducted by john c in 1985 , biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the u.s

the stratford-upon-avon and midland junction railway ( smjr ) was formed by the combination of four railway companies the ironstone available to the south wales iron-making industries had become scarce and was of poor quality , and there was huge demand the northamptonshire ore was not of the highest quality but it was abundantly available and conveying it to south wales was worthwhile the northampton and banbury railway was authorised by act of parliament on 9 july 1847 , with the intention of connecting the ironstone fields of northamptonshire with a market for iron ore in south wales in fact the ambitious scheme failed to raise the capital it needed to carry out its plans , and it had to obtain powers for an extension of time when the original authorisation lapsed ; the second act was passed on 28 july 1863 ; the name was changed to the northampton and banbury junction railway ( n & bjr ) the company was able to operate a passenger service from blisworth through towcester , wappenham , helmdon and cockley brake to banbury in fact the desired connecting line across the hills to chipping norton was built much later by the banbury and cheltenham direct railway , which opened on 6 april 1887 the east and west junction railway the next line to be authorised was the east and west junction railway ( e & wjr ) ; it obtained its act of parliament on 23 june 1864 it was to build a 33-mile from the northampton and banbury junction railway at green 's norton junction , a short distance west of towcester , and to continue from there , crossing the great western railway south of fenny compton , to join the stratford on avon railway at stratford-upon-avon between blisworth and green 's norton junction this was by running powers over the northampton and banbury junction railway

since the human visual system is much more sensitive to variations in brightness than color , a video system can be optimized by devoting more bandwidth to the luma component ( usually denoted y ' ) , than to the color difference components cb and cr in compressed images , for example , the 4:2:2 ycbcr scheme requires two-thirds the bandwidth of non-subsampled '' 4:4:4 '' rgb at normal viewing distances , there is no perceptible loss incurred by sampling the color detail at a lower rate , i.e in video systems , this is achieved through the use of color difference components the signal is divided into a luma ( y ' ) component and two color difference components ( chroma ) a gamma-corrected signal has the advantage of emulating the logarithmic sensitivity of human vision , with more levels dedicated to the darker levels than the lighter ones why 4k video looks better on a 1080p screen – the daily note ( with graphics explaining chroma subsampling the parts are ( in their respective order ) : j : horizontal sampling reference ( width of the conceptual region ) a : number of chrominance samples ( cr , cb ) in the first row of j pixels b : number of changes of chrominance samples ( cr , cb ) between first and second row of j pixels also note that the diagram does not indicate any chroma filtering , which should be applied to avoid aliasing each of the three ycbcr components has the same sample rate , thus there is no chroma subsampling note that '' 4:4:4 '' may instead be referring to rgb color space , which implicitly also does not have any chroma subsampling the two chroma components are sampled at half the horizontal sample rate of luma : the horizontal chroma resolution is halved cb horizontal resolution is half that of cr ( and a quarter of the horizontal resolution of y ) in 4:1:1 chroma subsampling , the horizontal color resolution is quartered , and the bandwidth is halved compared to no chroma subsampling thus the dv system actually provides a superior color bandwidth compared to the best composite analog specifications for ntsc , despite having only 1/4 of the chroma bandwidth of a '' full '' digital signal formats that use 4:1:1 chroma subsampling include : dvcpro ( ntsc and pal ) ntsc dv and dvcam d-7 in 4:2:0 , the horizontal sampling is doubled compared to 4:1:1 , but as the cb and cr channels are only sampled on each alternate line in this scheme , the vertical resolution is halved in general , secam territories either have to use a pal-capable display or a transcoder to convert the pal signal to secam for display cb and cr are sited between pixels in the vertical direction ( sited interstitially ) most digital video formats corresponding to pal use 4:2:0 chroma subsampling , with the exception of dvcpro25 , which uses 4:1:1 chroma subsampling in the 4:2:0 interlaced scheme , however , vertical resolution of the chroma is roughly halved , since the chroma samples effectively describe an area 2 samples wide by 4 samples tall instead of 2×2 in the vertical dimension , both luma and chroma are sampled at the full hd sampling rate ( 1080 samples vertically ) one difference between the two is that the scale factors on the chroma components ( u , v , cb , and cr ) are different note that the luma ( y ' ) of video engineering deviates from the luminance ( y ) of color science ( as defined by cie )

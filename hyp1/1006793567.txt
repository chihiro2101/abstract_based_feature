the requirements of an ordinary prng are also satisfied by a cryptographically secure prng , but the reverse is not true additionally , if there is an entropy input while running , it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input 's state to predict future conditions of the csprng state first , while most prngs outputs appear random to assorted statistical tests , they do not resist determined reverse engineering specialized statistical tests may be found specially tuned to such a prng that shows the random numbers not to be truly random second , for most prngs , when their state has been revealed , all past random numbers can be retrodicted , allowing an attacker to read all past messages , as well as future ones nist sp 800-90a rev.1 : this is essentially nist sp 800-90a with dual_ec_drbg removed , and is the withdrawn standard 's replacement there are also standards for statistical testing of new csprng designs : a statistical test suite for random and pseudorandom number generators , nist special publication 800-22 , randomness requirements for security java '' entropy pool '' for cryptographically secure unpredictable random numbers cryptographically secure random number on windows without using cryptoapi conjectured security of the ansi-nist elliptic curve rng , daniel r a security analysis of the nist sp 800-90 elliptic curve random number generator , daniel r

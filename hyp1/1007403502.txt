behe grew up in harrisburg , pennsylvania , where he attended grade school at st margaret mary school and later graduated from bishop mcdevitt high school he received his phd in biochemistry at the university of pennsylvania in 1978 for his thesis research on sickle-cell disease lehigh university exhibits a disclaimer on its website stating that the university does not endorse behe 's views on evolution : michael behe is a roman catholic . irreducible complexity and intelligent design behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution , but that after reading evolution : a theory in crisis ( 1985 ) , by michael denton , he came to question evolution behe 2002b later , behe came to believe that there was evidence , at a biochemical level , that some biological systems were '' irreducibly complex '' he thought that these systems could not , even in principle , have evolved by natural selection he believed that the only possible alternative explanation for such complex structures was that they were created by an '' intelligent designer '' '' we therefore find that professor behe 's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large supreme court decision barred the required teaching of creation science from public schools but allowed evolutionary theory on the grounds of scientific validity after the decision , a later draft of the textbook of pandas and people ( 1989 ) systematically replaced each and every cognate of the word '' creation '' with the phrase '' intelligent design '' or similar id terms dover area school district the books of lawyer phillip e in march 1992 , a conference at southern methodist university brought behe together with other leading figures into what johnson later called the '' wedge strategy '' in 1993 , the '' johnson-behe cadre of scholars '' met at pajaro dunes , california , and behe presented for the first time his idea of irreducibly complex molecular machinery in 1996 , behe became a senior fellow of the discovery institute 's '' center for the renewal of science and culture '' ( later renamed the center for science and culture ) , an organization dedicated to promoting intelligent design behe later agreed that they were essentially the same when he defended intelligent design at the dover trial in 1996 , behe published his ideas on irreducible complexity in his book darwin 's black box as to the identity of the intelligent designer , behe responds that if , deep in the woods , one were to come across a group of flowers that clearly spelled out the name '' lehigh '' , one would have no doubt that the pattern was the result of intelligent design …like it or not , a raft of important distinctions intervene between a conclusion of design and identification of a designer …if one wishes to be academically rigorous , one ca n't leap directly from design to a transcendent god …to reach a transcendent god , other , nonscientific arguments have to be made – philosophical and theological arguments in darwin 's black box ( behe 1996 ) i claimed that the bacterial flagellum was irreducibly complex and so required deliberate intelligent design the flip side of this claim is that the flagellum ca n't be produced by natural selection acting on random mutation , or any other unintelligent process once again , what we have to acknowledge is that in order to test intelligent design theory , the required test conditions must be such that the causal interaction between an intelligent agent and organism must be available to observation even if his experiment did produce the flagellum , id 's proponents could argue that the intelligent agent was merely acting in the test tube '' behe has charged that his detractors are inconsistent : '' coyne 's conclusion that design is unfalsifiable , however , seems to be at odds with the arguments of other reviewers of my book clearly , russell doolittle ( doolittle 1997 ) , kenneth miller ( miller 1999 ) , and others have advanced scientific arguments aimed at falsifying id 1996 ) had been as doolittle first thought , or if barry hall 's work ( hall 1999 ) had indeed shown what miller implied , then they correctly believed my claims about irreducible complexity would have suffered quite a blow and since my claim for intelligent design requires that no unintelligent process be sufficient to produce such irreducibly complex systems , then the plausibility of id would suffer enormously the fact that critical reviewers advance scientific arguments against id ( whether successfully or not ) shows that intelligent design is indeed falsifiable dembski and others in the intelligent design movement , behe accepts the common descent of species , including that humans descended from other primates , although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species although darwin 's mechanism – natural selection working on variation – might explain many things , however , i do not believe it explains molecular life i also do not think it surprising that the new science of the very small might change the way we view the less small dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 68 of 139 earlier during his direct testimony , behe had argued that a computer simulation of evolution he performed with snoke shows that evolution is not likely to produce certain complex biochemical systems dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 71 of 139 '' professor behe 's concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 74 of 139 '' professor behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems : ( 1 ) the bacterial flagellum ; ( 2 ) the blood-clotting cascade ; and ( 3 ) the immune system '' united states

behe grew up in harrisburg , pennsylvania , where he attended grade school at st margaret mary school and later graduated from bishop mcdevitt high school in 1985 , he moved to lehigh university and is currently a professor of biochemistry lehigh university exhibits a disclaimer on its website stating that the university does not endorse behe 's views on evolution : he is married to celeste behe and the two have nine children who are homeschooled . irreducible complexity and intelligent design behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution , but that after reading evolution : a theory in crisis ( 1985 ) , by michael denton , he came to question evolution behe 2002b later , behe came to believe that there was evidence , at a biochemical level , that some biological systems were '' irreducibly complex '' irreducible complexity has been rejected by the scientific community '' we therefore find that professor behe 's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large dover area school district the 1987 edwards v johnson on theistic science dealt directly with criticism of evolutionary theory and its purported biased '' materialism '' science , and aimed to legitimize the teaching of creationism in schools '' in 1993 , the '' johnson-behe cadre of scholars '' met at pajaro dunes , california , and behe presented for the first time his idea of irreducibly complex molecular machinery in 1996 , behe became a senior fellow of the discovery institute 's '' center for the renewal of science and culture '' ( later renamed the center for science and culture ) , an organization dedicated to promoting intelligent design forrest 2001 for the 1993 edition of pandas , behe wrote a chapter on coagulation , presenting arguments which he later presented in very similar terms in a chapter in his 1996 book darwin 's black box behe later agreed that they were essentially the same when he defended intelligent design at the dover trial in 1996 , behe published his ideas on irreducible complexity in his book darwin 's black box behe 's refusal to identify the nature of any proposed intelligent designer frustrates scientists , who see it as a move to avoid any possibility of testing the positive claims of id while allowing him and the intelligent design movement to distance themselves from some of the more overtly religiously motivated critics of evolution as to the identity of the intelligent designer , behe responds that if , deep in the woods , one were to come across a group of flowers that clearly spelled out the name '' lehigh '' , one would have no doubt that the pattern was the result of intelligent design we can determine that a system was designed by examining the system itself , and we can hold the conviction of design much more strongly than a conviction about the identity of the designer â€¦if one wishes to be academically rigorous , one ca n't leap directly from design to a transcendent god in darwin 's black box ( behe 1996 ) i claimed that the bacterial flagellum was irreducibly complex and so required deliberate intelligent design the flip side of this claim is that the flagellum ca n't be produced by natural selection acting on random mutation , or any other unintelligent process to falsify such a claim , a scientist could go into the laboratory , place a bacterial species lacking a flagellum under some selective pressure ( for mobility , say ) , grow it for ten thousand generations , and see if a flagellum -- or any equally complex system -- was produced '' to this , these responses have been made : '' behe 's claim that intelligent design would be 'disproven ' is not correct for the simple fact that no legitimate test of the intelligent design theory has been provided in his example behe 's suggestion of an experiment involving active selection for mobility is quite irrelevant to testing an intelligent design theory since the causal conditions involve the experimenter , not the intelligent agent to which the theory refers '' related work and unpublished papers by fitzhugh are available at the polychaetous annelids research studies page there is no way to tell , from this experiment , whether the intelligent agent was actually working inside the laboratory ; therefore , the test does not falsify the theory '' behe has charged that his detractors are inconsistent : '' coyne 's conclusion that design is unfalsifiable , however , seems to be at odds with the arguments of other reviewers of my book and since my claim for intelligent design requires that no unintelligent process be sufficient to produce such irreducibly complex systems , then the plausibility of id would suffer enormously the fact that critical reviewers advance scientific arguments against id ( whether successfully or not ) shows that intelligent design is indeed falsifiable dembski and others in the intelligent design movement , behe accepts the common descent of species , including that humans descended from other primates , although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species many people think that questioning darwinian evolution must be equivalent to espousing creationism further , i find the idea of common descent ( that all organisms share a common ancestor ) fairly convincing , and have no particular reason to doubt it i greatly respect the work of my colleagues who study the development and behavior of organisms within an evolutionary framework , and i think that evolutionary biologists have contributed enormously to our understanding of the world i also do not think it surprising that the new science of the very small might change the way we view the less small dover area school district testimony many of behe 's critics have pointed to these exchanges as examples they believe further undermine behe 's statements about irreducible complexity and intelligent design dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 71 of 139 '' professor behe 's concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 81 of 139 jones would later say that eric rothschild 's cross examination of behe was '' as good a cross-examination of an expert witness as i have ever seen michael behe biography from lehigh university michael behe biography from the discovery institute michael behe biography from the access research network irreducible complexity and michael behe on intelligent design from the talkorigins archive

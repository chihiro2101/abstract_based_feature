behe grew up in harrisburg , pennsylvania , where he attended grade school at st lehigh university exhibits a disclaimer on its website stating that the university does not endorse behe 's views on evolution : . irreducible complexity and intelligent design behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution , but that after reading evolution : a theory in crisis ( 1985 ) , by michael denton , he came to question evolution behe 2002b later , behe came to believe that there was evidence , at a biochemical level , that some biological systems were '' irreducibly complex '' he thought that these systems could not , even in principle , have evolved by natural selection he believed that the only possible alternative explanation for such complex structures was that they were created by an '' intelligent designer '' '' we therefore find that professor behe 's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large after the decision , a later draft of the textbook of pandas and people ( 1989 ) systematically replaced each and every cognate of the word '' creation '' with the phrase '' intelligent design '' or similar id terms johnson on theistic science dealt directly with criticism of evolutionary theory and its purported biased '' materialism '' science , and aimed to legitimize the teaching of creationism in schools in march 1992 , a conference at southern methodist university brought behe together with other leading figures into what johnson later called the '' wedge strategy '' in 1993 , the '' johnson-behe cadre of scholars '' met at pajaro dunes , california , and behe presented for the first time his idea of irreducibly complex molecular machinery forrest 2001 for the 1993 edition of pandas , behe wrote a chapter on coagulation , presenting arguments which he later presented in very similar terms in a chapter in his 1996 book darwin 's black box behe later agreed that they were essentially the same when he defended intelligent design at the dover trial in 1996 , behe published his ideas on irreducible complexity in his book darwin 's black box as to the identity of the intelligent designer , behe responds that if , deep in the woods , one were to come across a group of flowers that clearly spelled out the name '' lehigh '' , one would have no doubt that the pattern was the result of intelligent design …if one wishes to be academically rigorous , one ca n't leap directly from design to a transcendent god 227–229 behe gives the following reply to the assertion that intelligent design is '' unfalsifiable '' or that he is attempting to avoid the possibility of testing the positive claims of intelligent design : '' in fact , my argument for intelligent design is open to direct experimental rebuttal in darwin 's black box ( behe 1996 ) i claimed that the bacterial flagellum was irreducibly complex and so required deliberate intelligent design to falsify such a claim , a scientist could go into the laboratory , place a bacterial species lacking a flagellum under some selective pressure ( for mobility , say ) , grow it for ten thousand generations , and see if a flagellum -- or any equally complex system -- was produced '' to this , these responses have been made : '' behe 's claim that intelligent design would be 'disproven ' is not correct for the simple fact that no legitimate test of the intelligent design theory has been provided in his example once again , what we have to acknowledge is that in order to test intelligent design theory , the required test conditions must be such that the causal interaction between an intelligent agent and organism must be available to observation behe 's suggestion of an experiment involving active selection for mobility is quite irrelevant to testing an intelligent design theory since the causal conditions involve the experimenter , not the intelligent agent to which the theory refers even if his experiment did produce the flagellum , id 's proponents could argue that the intelligent agent was merely acting in the test tube there is no way to tell , from this experiment , whether the intelligent agent was actually working inside the laboratory ; therefore , the test does not falsify the theory '' behe has charged that his detractors are inconsistent : '' coyne 's conclusion that design is unfalsifiable , however , seems to be at odds with the arguments of other reviewers of my book clearly , russell doolittle ( doolittle 1997 ) , kenneth miller ( miller 1999 ) , and others have advanced scientific arguments aimed at falsifying id 1996 ) had been as doolittle first thought , or if barry hall 's work ( hall 1999 ) had indeed shown what miller implied , then they correctly believed my claims about irreducible complexity would have suffered quite a blow and since my claim for intelligent design requires that no unintelligent process be sufficient to produce such irreducibly complex systems , then the plausibility of id would suffer enormously either it is unfalsifiable and floats serenely beyond experimental reproach , or it can be criticized on the basis of our observations and is therefore testable the fact that critical reviewers advance scientific arguments against id ( whether successfully or not ) shows that intelligent design is indeed falsifiable dembski and others in the intelligent design movement , behe accepts the common descent of species , including that humans descended from other primates , although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species in his own words : '' evolution is a controversial topic , so it is necessary to address a few basic questions at the beginning of the book many people think that questioning darwinian evolution must be equivalent to espousing creationism as commonly understood , creationism involves belief in an earth formed only about ten thousand years ago , an interpretation of the bible that is still very popular i also do not think it surprising that the new science of the very small might change the way we view the less small the article also criticized the use of false analogies and neglecting evidence of new genetic raw material production for evolution ( '' behe is correct that the loss of genetic information is an important mechanism dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 68 of 139 '' what is more , defense experts concede that id is not a theory as that term is defined by the nas and admit that id is at best 'fringe science ' which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 74 of 139 '' professor behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems : ( 1 ) the bacterial flagellum ; ( 2 ) the blood-clotting cascade ; and ( 3 ) the immune system dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 81 of 139 jones would later say that eric rothschild 's cross examination of behe was '' as good a cross-examination of an expert witness as i have ever seen

behe grew up in harrisburg , pennsylvania , where he attended grade school at st margaret mary school and later graduated from bishop mcdevitt high school he received his phd in biochemistry at the university of pennsylvania in 1978 for his thesis research on sickle-cell disease lehigh university exhibits a disclaimer on its website stating that the university does not endorse behe 's views on evolution : . irreducible complexity and intelligent design behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution , but that after reading evolution : a theory in crisis ( 1985 ) , by michael denton , he came to question evolution behe 2002b later , behe came to believe that there was evidence , at a biochemical level , that some biological systems were '' irreducibly complex '' he thought that these systems could not , even in principle , have evolved by natural selection '' we therefore find that professor behe 's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large supreme court decision barred the required teaching of creation science from public schools but allowed evolutionary theory on the grounds of scientific validity after the decision , a later draft of the textbook of pandas and people ( 1989 ) systematically replaced each and every cognate of the word '' creation '' with the phrase '' intelligent design '' or similar id terms dover area school district the books of lawyer phillip e in march 1992 , a conference at southern methodist university brought behe together with other leading figures into what johnson later called the '' wedge strategy '' in 1993 , the '' johnson-behe cadre of scholars '' met at pajaro dunes , california , and behe presented for the first time his idea of irreducibly complex molecular machinery in 1996 , behe became a senior fellow of the discovery institute 's '' center for the renewal of science and culture '' ( later renamed the center for science and culture ) , an organization dedicated to promoting intelligent design behe later agreed that they were essentially the same when he defended intelligent design at the dover trial in 1996 , behe published his ideas on irreducible complexity in his book darwin 's black box behe 's refusal to identify the nature of any proposed intelligent designer frustrates scientists , who see it as a move to avoid any possibility of testing the positive claims of id while allowing him and the intelligent design movement to distance themselves from some of the more overtly religiously motivated critics of evolution …the designer need not necessarily even be a truly 'supernatural ' being …if one wishes to be academically rigorous , one ca n't leap directly from design to a transcendent god in darwin 's black box ( behe 1996 ) i claimed that the bacterial flagellum was irreducibly complex and so required deliberate intelligent design the flip side of this claim is that the flagellum ca n't be produced by natural selection acting on random mutation , or any other unintelligent process once again , what we have to acknowledge is that in order to test intelligent design theory , the required test conditions must be such that the causal interaction between an intelligent agent and organism must be available to observation even if his experiment did produce the flagellum , id 's proponents could argue that the intelligent agent was merely acting in the test tube there is no way to tell , from this experiment , whether the intelligent agent was actually working inside the laboratory ; therefore , the test does not falsify the theory the total population of bacteria or the amount of genetic variation within that population ) or the amount of time involved.a computer simulation showed that a binding site that behe himself characterized as irreducibly complex could evolve in 20,000 years yet here he is demanding that scientists do an actual experiment with actual bacteria , the numbers of which could not possibly be contained in a lab , on the evolution of a much more complex biochemical system that would almost certainly take longer to evolve than the whole of recorded human history and since my claim for intelligent design requires that no unintelligent process be sufficient to produce such irreducibly complex systems , then the plausibility of id would suffer enormously dembski and others in the intelligent design movement , behe accepts the common descent of species , including that humans descended from other primates , although he states that common descent does not by itself explain the differences between species as commonly understood , creationism involves belief in an earth formed only about ten thousand years ago , an interpretation of the bible that is still very popular for the record , i have no reason to doubt that the universe is the billions of years old that physicists say it is although darwin 's mechanism – natural selection working on variation – might explain many things , however , i do not believe it explains molecular life '' for example , both humans and chimps have a broken copy of a gene that in other mammals helps make vitamin c pennock , behe took issue with the '' intelligent design '' group being associated with '' creationism , '' saying readers would typically take that to mean biblical literalism and young earth creationism ( yec ) joshua swamidass , a harsh critique by jerry coyne in the washington post , and a scholarly rebuttal in evolution from gregory lang and amber rice , behe 's colleagues at lehigh university dover area school district testimony many of behe 's critics have pointed to these exchanges as examples they believe further undermine behe 's statements about irreducible complexity and intelligent design dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 71 of 139 '' professor behe 's concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur dover area school district/4 : whether id is science page 81 of 139 jones would later say that eric rothschild 's cross examination of behe was '' as good a cross-examination of an expert witness as i have ever seen the case was filed by association of christian schools international , which argued that the university of california was being discriminatory by not recognizing science classes that use creationism books james otero rejected behe 's claims , saying that behe '' submitted a declaration concluding that the bju bju press bob jones university press text mentions standard scientific content

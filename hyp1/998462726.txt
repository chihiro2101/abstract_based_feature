'' accountability '' stems from late latin accomptare ( to account ) , a prefixed form of computare ( to calculate ) , which in turn derived from putare ( to reckon ) political accountability is when a politician makes choices on behalf of the people and the people have the ability to reward or sanction the politician in representative democracies citizens delegate power to elected officials through periodic elections in order to represent or act in their interest accountability occurs when citizens only vote to re-elect representatives who act in their interests , and if representatives then select policies that will help them be re-elected rational anticipation requires that representatives anticipate the consequences of being out of step with their constituency and then govern in accordance with citizens ' wishes to avoid negative consequences accountability can still be achieved even if citizens are not perfectly knowledgeable about representative 's actions as long as representatives believe that they will be held accountable by citizens they will still act in accordance with the citizens ' interests electoral accountability refers to citizens using the vote to sanction or reward politicians , but other forms of political accountability do exist some researchers have considered the accountability using formal theory , which makes assumptions about the state of the world to draw larger conclusions ( link ) selection , voters choosing candidates based on who will best represent their interests , is another method by which voters hold their representative accountable these methods of accountability can occur simultaneously with voters holding representatives accountable using sanctioning and selection when politicians do not have control over the outcomes , then accountability breaks down because it is harder to hold them accountable further , when organizations are unable to monitor elections and provide information to voters , then voters struggle to sanction the incumbent politicians may be incentivized to provide public goods as a means of accountability research suggests that public goods provision is conditional on being able to attribute outcomes to politicians as opposed to civil servants another condition determining how voters use the provision of public goods to hold leaders accountable is whether the prioritization of public goods is determined either directly via vote or delegated to a governing body an experiment in new mexico regarding proposed spending during the state 's 2008 special summer legislative session provides evidence that legislators update their positions when learning about voters ' policy preferences , indicating representative democracy can increase accountability when politicians learn about voters ' preferences these contrasting outcomes highlight the trustee-vs-delegate debate , though the lack of objective superior outcomes in projects decided by vote as opposed to committee in the afghanistan experiment indicate neither is superior to the other in determining which public good should be given priority to put this in context , voters rewarded incumbent politicians with a 12 %

norma r.a here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of , and take some responsibility for , the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part the traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity ( user , process , device ) because many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies , it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results '' the problem of many hands '' in restoring responsibility : ethics in government , business and healthcare if individuals are held accountable or responsible , individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished , or they '' take responsibility '' in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences accountability is an element of a raci to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task , and the one who delegates the work to those responsible as defined by national council on measurement in education ( ncme ) ,

political accountability is when a politician makes choices on behalf of the people and the people have the ability to reward or sanction the politician in representative democracies citizens delegate power to elected officials through periodic elections in order to represent or act in their interest the challenge then becomes why would rulers with such power , who presumably have divergent interests from the people , act in the best interest of the people ? citizens can rely on rewards or sanctions to threaten or reward politicians who might otherwise act antithetical to the people 's interest '' governments are 'accountable ' if voters can discern whether governments are acting in their interest and sanction them appropriately , so that those incumbents who act in the best interest of the citizens win reelection and those who do not lose them accountability can still be achieved even if citizens are not perfectly knowledgeable about representative 's actions as long as representatives believe that they will be held accountable by citizens they will still act in accordance with the citizens ' interests electoral accountability refers to citizens using the vote to sanction or reward politicians , but other forms of political accountability do exist voters can hold representatives accountable through the process of sanctioning , voters voting the incumbent out of office in response to poor performance while politicians face a decrease in vote share as a result of poor performance , they are less likely to see an increase in vote share for good performance selection , voters choosing candidates based on who will best represent their interests , is another method by which voters hold their representative accountable these methods of accountability can occur simultaneously with voters holding representatives accountable using sanctioning and selection these conclusions rely on the assumption that voters do not observe the policy implemented by the incumbent , but do know their own welfare when politicians do not have control over the outcomes , then accountability breaks down because it is harder to hold them accountable further , when organizations are unable to monitor elections and provide information to voters , then voters struggle to sanction the incumbent candidate entry & vote choice in the wake of incumbent performance transparency the ability of voters to attribute credit and blame of outcomes also determines the extent of public goods provision this can be enhanced by more short-run and visible inputs and outcomes such as famine relief or drinking water , whereas low-visibility issues such as sanitation and education may be more difficult to attribute credit and thus less likely to provided another condition determining how voters use the provision of public goods to hold leaders accountable is whether the prioritization of public goods is determined either directly via vote or delegated to a governing body beath , andrew , christia , fotini , & enikolopov , ruben other research indicates voters use elections to hold politicians accountable for the provision of public goods in ghana , the improvement of road conditions is linked to increasing vote share for incumbent parties both of these research outcomes hinge on the context of voters being able to attribute the service of public goods to politicians , however there is evidence that as autocratic governments lose seats in their party legislatures , they respond by increasing spending on public goods such as education , healthcare , and pensions one study of the tea party movement in the united states has shown that protests per se have an impact on political change mass protests instigated by economic hardship and political repression occurred in 16 sub-saharan african countries , and 21 governments in the region implemented significant political reforms such as adoption of multiparty elections one study has also shown that civil society organizations such as ngos can increase the performance of local government according to the central government 's standards by monitoring and disclosing information about local government performance in authoritarian regimes like china solidary groups – groups based on shared moral obligations and interests – in rural china , where members of the group share moral obligations and interests , can hold local officials accountable as well in uganda , civil society organizations ( csos ) that divulge to the public how well an incumbent is performing their job duties , in a district with an upcoming competitive election , increases the performance of the politician for the rest of their term in contrast to these works , meta-analysis released in 2019 uncover no effects from cso voter information campaigns on political accountability after examining the results from seven trials across six countries when the media focuses attention on data trends associated with these positions , constituents are then able to use this information to retrospectively vote for or against the incumbent based on the performance shown while in office when selectorates ' hold on power is not overly dependent on the leader in office , selectorates can remove poorly performing leaders , and this accountability by selectorates render it possible for autocracies to perform better for the benefit of all traditional leaders in zambia provide local public goods despite the fact that they lack an electoral incentive to provide public goods political corruption refers to '' the misuse or the abuse of public office for private gains '' , where corrupt practices include fraud , appropriation of public funds , or accepting bribes are some examples of corrupt practices moreover , in high-corrupt contexts , voters may become more tolerant or even prefer corrupt politicians because others are also perceived as corrupt , leading to a corrupt equilibrium '' where voters are generally willing to retain corrupt politicians '' , which is referred to as a '' political corruption trap '' in fact , documentation on how a corrupt government ( fujimori 's government from 1998–2000 , in peru ) strategically undermined check and balance institutions , suggests that the media —e.g within an organization , the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors , such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies for example , the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability ; the use of shared user ids and passwords destroys accountability students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are equals governments , politicians and political parties are more likely to resort to electoral manipulation and fraud when they believe they might be removed from office and face few institutional constraints to their power accountability standards include : ingo accountability charter , signed by a large

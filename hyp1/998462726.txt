'' accountability '' stems from late latin accomptare ( to account ) , a prefixed form of computare ( to calculate ) , which in turn derived from putare ( to reckon ) political accountability is when a politician makes choices on behalf of the people and the people have the ability to reward or sanction the politician in representative democracies citizens delegate power to elected officials through periodic elections in order to represent or act in their interest the challenge then becomes why would rulers with such power , who presumably have divergent interests from the people , act in the best interest of the people ? citizens can rely on rewards or sanctions to threaten or reward politicians who might otherwise act antithetical to the people 's interest accountability occurs when citizens only vote to re-elect representatives who act in their interests , and if representatives then select policies that will help them be re-elected '' governments are 'accountable ' if voters can discern whether governments are acting in their interest and sanction them appropriately , so that those incumbents who act in the best interest of the citizens win reelection and those who do not lose them rational anticipation requires that representatives anticipate the consequences of being out of step with their constituency and then govern in accordance with citizens ' wishes to avoid negative consequences accountability can still be achieved even if citizens are not perfectly knowledgeable about representative 's actions as long as representatives believe that they will be held accountable by citizens they will still act in accordance with the citizens ' interests electoral accountability refers to citizens using the vote to sanction or reward politicians , but other forms of political accountability do exist some researchers have considered the accountability using formal theory , which makes assumptions about the state of the world to draw larger conclusions ( link ) voters can hold representatives accountable through the process of sanctioning , voters voting the incumbent out of office in response to poor performance while politicians face a decrease in vote share as a result of poor performance , they are less likely to see an increase in vote share for good performance these conclusions rely on the assumption that voters do not observe the policy implemented by the incumbent , but do know their own welfare when politicians do not have control over the outcomes , then accountability breaks down because it is harder to hold them accountable refer to the liability of government servants to give a satisfactory account of the use of their power and resources therefore , checking the accountability is the basis of the success of public administration politicians may be incentivized to provide public goods as a means of accountability fault lines : the effects of bureaucratic power on electoral accountability research suggests that public goods provision is conditional on being able to attribute outcomes to politicians as opposed to civil servants this can be enhanced by more short-run and visible inputs and outcomes such as famine relief or drinking water , whereas low-visibility issues such as sanitation and education may be more difficult to attribute credit and thus less likely to provided another condition determining how voters use the provision of public goods to hold leaders accountable is whether the prioritization of public goods is determined either directly via vote or delegated to a governing body an experiment in new mexico regarding proposed spending during the state 's 2008 special summer legislative session provides evidence that legislators update their positions when learning about voters ' policy preferences , indicating representative democracy can increase accountability when politicians learn about voters ' preferences a 2016 experiment in afghanistan regarding rural development projects , however , finds that when voters directly prioritize their preferences at the ballot box , they perceive the quality of local government to be higher than when a governing committee prioritizes development projects both of these research outcomes hinge on the context of voters being able to attribute the service of public goods to politicians , however there is evidence that as autocratic governments lose seats in their party legislatures , they respond by increasing spending on public goods such as education , healthcare , and pensions governments are held accountable if citizens can punish and/or reward the government to influence it to pursue the best interests of citizens one study of the tea party movement in the united states has shown that protests per se have an impact on political change in contrast to these works , meta-analysis released in 2019 uncover no effects from cso voter information campaigns on political accountability after examining the results from seven trials across six countries in ghana , election-day monitoring of polling centers for district-level positions , as well as gaining awareness of monitoring in an upcoming election , increases job performance among incumbents as these officials spent more of their annual constituency development fund allocations from the central government on public goods for the electorate when the media focuses attention on data trends associated with these positions , constituents are then able to use this information to retrospectively vote for or against the incumbent based on the performance shown while in office thus , strategic incumbent senators will seek reelection less when their approval ratings are low during their time in office traditional leaders in zambia provide local public goods despite the fact that they lack an electoral incentive to provide public goods political corruption refers to '' the misuse or the abuse of public office for private gains '' , where corrupt practices include fraud , appropriation of public funds , or accepting bribes are some examples of corrupt practices corruption can be negative for politicians ' evaluations , since citizens ' may perceive corruption as a signal of poor performance , motivating them to sanction the incumbent romm in her work on accountability in social research , including her book on new racism : revisiting researcher accountabilities , reviewed by carole truman in the journal sociological research online control of the media may also be especially beneficial to incumbents in new or developing democracies , who consider media control a spoil of office some efforts at improving accountability by preventing electoral manipulation and fraud have obtained a certain measure of success , such as using cell-phone applications for monitoring and disseminating polling station results and employing domestic or international election observers accountability standards include : ingo

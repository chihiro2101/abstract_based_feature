'' accountability '' stems from late latin accomptare ( to account ) , a prefixed form of computare ( to calculate ) , which in turn derived from putare ( to reckon ) political accountability is when a politician makes choices on behalf of the people and the people have the ability to reward or sanction the politician the challenge then becomes why would rulers with such power , who presumably have divergent interests from the people , act in the best interest of the people ? citizens can rely on rewards or sanctions to threaten or reward politicians who might otherwise act antithetical to the people 's interest accountability occurs when citizens only vote to re-elect representatives who act in their interests , and if representatives then select policies that will help them be re-elected '' representatives can be held accountable through two mechanisms : electoral replacement and rational anticipation in electoral replacement citizens vote to replace representatives who are out of step with their interests rational anticipation requires that representatives anticipate the consequences of being out of step with their constituency and then govern in accordance with citizens ' wishes to avoid negative consequences accountability can still be achieved even if citizens are not perfectly knowledgeable about representative 's actions as long as representatives believe that they will be held accountable by citizens they will still act in accordance with the citizens ' interests electoral accountability refers to citizens using the vote to sanction or reward politicians , but other forms of political accountability do exist some researchers have considered the accountability using formal theory , which makes assumptions about the state of the world to draw larger conclusions ( link ) voters can hold representatives accountable through the process of sanctioning , voters voting the incumbent out of office in response to poor performance while politicians face a decrease in vote share as a result of poor performance , they are less likely to see an increase in vote share for good performance selection , voters choosing candidates based on who will best represent their interests , is another method by which voters hold their representative accountable these methods of accountability can occur simultaneously with voters holding representatives accountable using sanctioning and selection politicians may be incentivized to provide public goods as a means of accountability the ability of voters to attribute credit and blame of outcomes also determines the extent of public goods provision another condition determining how voters use the provision of public goods to hold leaders accountable is whether the prioritization of public goods is determined either directly via vote or delegated to a governing body a 2016 experiment in afghanistan regarding rural development projects , however , finds that when voters directly prioritize their preferences at the ballot box , they perceive the quality of local government to be higher than when a governing committee prioritizes development projects politicians may also have incentives to respond to pressure for public goods provision in electoral autocracies while scholars who study democratic theory emphasize the role of elections in ensuring accountability , another strand of scholars investigates non-electoral forms of accountability in democracies and non-democracies and the conditions that make unelected leaders represent the interests of the general public political changes after protests can be the result of the protests per se or symptoms of shifts in political preferences underneath the observable phenomena of the protests in contrast to these works , meta-analysis released in 2019 uncover no effects from cso voter information campaigns on political accountability after examining the results from seven trials across six countries when selectorates ' hold on power is not overly dependent on the leader in office , selectorates can remove poorly performing leaders , and this accountability by selectorates render it possible for autocracies to perform better for the benefit of all traditional leaders in zambia provide local public goods despite the fact that they lack an electoral incentive to provide public goods political corruption refers to '' the misuse or the abuse of public office for private gains '' , where corrupt practices include fraud , appropriation of public funds , or accepting bribes are some examples of corrupt practices corruption can be negative for politicians ' evaluations , since citizens ' may perceive corruption as a signal of poor performance , motivating them to sanction the incumbent in fact , the model of retrospective voting that suggests that voters incentivize good politicians ' behavior by rewarding good and punishing bad performance , citizens are expected to sanction corrupt politicians the high corruption equilibrium is difficult to break due to the interaction between corrupt politicians , voters who tolerate and retain corrupt politicians , and potential entrants or challengers who are also apt to engage in corrupt practices , leading to the maintenance of corruption the literature about corruption finds mixed results about the role of political institutions —such as the executive , electoral institutions , federalism , and the judiciary— on the reduction of corruption in fact , documentation on how a corrupt government ( fujimori 's government from 1998–2000 , in peru ) strategically undermined check and balance institutions , suggests that the media —e.g on the other hand , there is evidence that points out to the fact that , despite strategic evasion and unintentional consequences , anticorruption initiatives are beneficial , as they allow to lower malfeasance and increases social welfare , even where strategic evasion is relatively large within an organization , the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors , such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in the social field – whether professional or others – have been thoroughly explored by norma r.a with the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities , especially in britain and the united states , some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities when elected officials and the public gain information , the public is better equipped to hold politicians

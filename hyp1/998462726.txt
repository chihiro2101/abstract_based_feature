'' accountability '' stems from late latin accomptare ( to account ) , a prefixed form of computare ( to calculate ) , which in turn derived from putare ( to reckon ) political accountability is when a politician makes choices on behalf of the people and the people have the ability to reward or sanction the politician in representative democracies citizens delegate power to elected officials through periodic elections in order to represent or act in their interest accountability occurs when citizens only vote to re-elect representatives who act in their interests , and if representatives then select policies that will help them be re-elected '' governments are 'accountable ' if voters can discern whether governments are acting in their interest and sanction them appropriately , so that those incumbents who act in the best interest of the citizens win reelection and those who do not lose them '' representatives can be held accountable through two mechanisms : electoral replacement and rational anticipation rational anticipation requires that representatives anticipate the consequences of being out of step with their constituency and then govern in accordance with citizens ' wishes to avoid negative consequences accountability can still be achieved even if citizens are not perfectly knowledgeable about representative 's actions as long as representatives believe that they will be held accountable by citizens they will still act in accordance with the citizens ' interests electoral accountability refers to citizens using the vote to sanction or reward politicians , but other forms of political accountability do exist some researchers have considered the accountability using formal theory , which makes assumptions about the state of the world to draw larger conclusions ( link ) voters can hold representatives accountable through the process of sanctioning , voters voting the incumbent out of office in response to poor performance while politicians face a decrease in vote share as a result of poor performance , they are less likely to see an increase in vote share for good performance selection , voters choosing candidates based on who will best represent their interests , is another method by which voters hold their representative accountable when politicians do not have control over the outcomes , then accountability breaks down because it is harder to hold them accountable thus , when voters have more information about the incumbent 's performance , the incumbent is more likely to voter sanctioning therefore , checking the accountability is the basis of the success of public administration fault lines : the effects of bureaucratic power on electoral accountability research suggests that public goods provision is conditional on being able to attribute outcomes to politicians as opposed to civil servants an experiment in new mexico regarding proposed spending during the state 's 2008 special summer legislative session provides evidence that legislators update their positions when learning about voters ' policy preferences , indicating representative democracy can increase accountability when politicians learn about voters ' preferences a 2016 experiment in afghanistan regarding rural development projects , however , finds that when voters directly prioritize their preferences at the ballot box , they perceive the quality of local government to be higher than when a governing committee prioritizes development projects other research indicates voters use elections to hold politicians accountable for the provision of public goods to put this in context , voters rewarded incumbent politicians with a 12 % increase in party seats in response to a 10 % increase of unbilled electricity in 2007 elections political changes after protests can be the result of the protests per se or symptoms of shifts in political preferences underneath the observable phenomena of the protests one study of the tea party movement in the united states has shown that protests per se have an impact on political change mass protests instigated by economic hardship and political repression occurred in 16 sub-saharan african countries , and 21 governments in the region implemented significant political reforms such as adoption of multiparty elections at the local level , various accountability measures exist that impact the job performance of elected officials however , recent studies suggest that , though voters have a general distaste for corruption , they often fail to punish corrupt incumbents ; and that some of them also receive benefits from their representatives ' corrupt practices , and prefer to retain this type of politicians the literature about corruption finds mixed results about the role of political institutions —such as the executive , electoral institutions , federalism , and the judiciary— on the reduction of corruption in fact , documentation on how a corrupt government ( fujimori 's government from 1998–2000 , in peru ) strategically undermined check and balance institutions , suggests that the media —e.g additionally , there is also evidence about the importance of local media —such as local radio stations— in holding accountable corrupt incumbents and promoting noncorrupt politicians also , ethical accountability plays a progressively important role in academic fields , such as laboratory experiments and field research romm in her work on accountability in social research , including her book on new racism : revisiting researcher accountabilities , reviewed by carole truman in the journal sociological research online that is , accountability is linked to considering carefully , and being open to challenge in relation to , one 's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research '' results '' are created for example , the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability ; the use of shared user ids and passwords destroys accountability they argue that media resolves the information asymmetries between citizens and government and provides a way of overcoming obstacles preventing political action in their work , they find releasing audit reports prior to elections creates a more informed electorate which holds incumbent officials accountable while large evidence supports the positive impact of press freedom on political accountability , other work has highlighted the significance of factors such as media concentration and ownership as government tools for influencing or controlling news content by preventing citizens from removing leaders through elections based on their performance in office , electoral manipulation breaks down accountability and may even undercut the consolidation of democratic institutions painter-morland mollie , ghislain deslandes , ( 2015 ) , '' authentic leading as relational accountability : facing up to the conflicting expectations of media leaders '' , leadership , online available 2 april , doi:1742715015578307 citizens ' circle for accountability accountability initiative organizational realities – accountability : what does it really mean ? international budget partnership : what we do

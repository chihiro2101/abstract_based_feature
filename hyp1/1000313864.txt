the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) the physiology of micturition and the physiologic basis of its disorders are subjects about which there is much confusion , especially at the supraspinal level micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax during the storage phase , the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax the external urethral sphincter ( sphincter urethrae ) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition during storage , bladder pressure stays low , because of the bladder 's highly compliant nature a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum at a certain level of afferent activity , the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued , neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally , causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons the firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract ; as a result , a sudden , sharp rise in intravesical pressure occurs the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second the posited benefits of faster voiding are decreased risk of predation ( while voiding ) and decreased risk of urinary tract infection another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center , which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter after transection of the brain stem just above the pons , the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it , whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain , the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal there is another facilitatory area in the posterior hypothalamus in humans with lesions in the superior frontal gyrus , the desire to urinate is reduced and there is also difficulty in stopping micturition once it has commenced however , stimulation experiments in animals indicate that other cortical areas also affect the process the bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full release of urine is experienced as a lessening of the discomfort in all three types the bladder contracts , but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely , and residual urine is left in the bladder paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area gradually , however , the muscle of the '' decentralized bladder '' becomes active , with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra after spinal shock has passed , a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues , although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers this type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist female urination devices are available to help women to urinate discreetly , as well to help them urinate while standing in one survey , 24 % of women reported involuntary urination during sexual intercourse ; in 66 % of sufferers urination occurred on penetration , while in 33 % urine leakage was restricted to orgasm when one dog marks over another dog 's urine , this is known as '' counter-marking '' or '' overmarking '' leg-lifting is more common in male wolves than female wolves , although dominant females also use the raised-leg posture , describes the neurophysiology of urination '' urination '' at howstuffworks.com

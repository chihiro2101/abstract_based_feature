the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) when the bladder is fully distended the superficial cells become squamous ( flat ) and the stratification of the cuboidal cells is reduced in order to provide lateral stretching micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax the muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems during the storage phase , the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax the external urethral sphincter ( sphincter urethrae ) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition the ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2–3 years , as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about therefore , the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum at a certain level of afferent activity , the conscious urge to void becomes difficult to ignore once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued , neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally , causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty elsevier after urination , the female urethra empties partially by gravity , with assistance from muscles urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for land mammals over 1 kilogram , the duration of urination does not vary with body mass , being dispersed around an average of 21 seconds ( standard deviation 13 seconds ) , despite a 4 order of magnitude ( 1000× ) difference in bladder volume for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second the posited benefits of faster voiding are decreased risk of predation ( while voiding ) and decreased risk of urinary tract infection in females the need to urinate is felt in the lower abdomen region when the bladder is full bladder sphincter dyssynergia , a discoordination between the bladder and external urethral sphincter as a result of brain or spinal cord injury a drug that increases urination is called a diuretic , whereas antidiuretics decrease the production of urine by the kidneys paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area as these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person the reason for the difference between the small , hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended , hypotonic bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known the reflex hyperactivity is made worse , and may be caused , by infection in the bladder wall due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate it is common for women in various regions of africa to use this method when they urinate , as do women in laos an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist the fetus urinates hourly and produces most of the amniotic fluid in the second and third trimester of pregnancy occasionally , if a male 's penis is damaged or removed , or a female 's genitals/urinary tract is damaged , other urination techniques must be used sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle , urinal , bedpan , or chamber pot ( also known as a gazunder ) public toilets may have urinals , usually for males , although female urinals exist , designed to be used in various ways urolagnia , a paraphilia , is an inclination to obtain human sexuality by looking at or thinking of urine or urination a stallion sometimes scent marks his urination spots to make his position as herd stallion clear unlike other female mammals , female spotted hyenas urinate , copulate , and give birth through an organ called the pseudo-penis raised-leg urination is the most significant form of scent marking in wolves , and is most frequent around the breeding season other types of urine-marking in wolves are flu ( flexed-leg urination ) , stu ( standing urination ) , and squ ( squatting urination ) , describes the neurophysiology of urination '' urination

the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) the bladder 's epithelium is termed transitional epithelium which contains a superficial layer of dome-like cells and multiple layers of stratified cuboidal cells underneath when evacuated in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder at high bladder volumes , afferent firing increases , causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage during the storage phase , the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about during storage , bladder pressure stays low , because of the bladder 's highly compliant nature a plot of bladder ( intravesical ) pressure against the depressant of fluid in the bladder ( called a cystometrogram ) , will show a very slight rise as the bladder is filled this phenomenon is a manifestation of the law of laplace , which states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius the bladder 's smooth muscle has some inherent contractile activity ; however , when its nerve supply is intact , stretch receptors in the bladder wall initiate a reflex contraction that has a lower threshold than the inherent contractile response of the muscle action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons conversely , afferent input causes contraction of the sphincter through excitation of onuf 's nucleus , and contraction of the bladder neck and urethra through excitation of the sympathetic preganglionic neurons diuresis ( production of urine by the kidney ) occurs constantly , and as the bladder becomes full , afferent firing increases , yet the micturition reflex can be voluntarily inhibited until it is appropriate to begin voiding voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the micturition reflex normally produces a series of contractions of the urinary bladder the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine one possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction the bladder can be made to contract by voluntary facilitation of the spinal voiding reflex when it contains only a few milliliters of urine voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well when the bladder becomes too full , the sphincter muscles will involuntarily relax , allowing urine to pass from the bladder in all three types the bladder contracts , but the contractions are generally not sufficient to empty the viscus completely , and residual urine is left in the bladder paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area as these people may have difficulty urinating in the presence of others and will consequently avoid using urinals directly adjacent to another person the bladder becomes distended , thin-walled , and hypotonic , but there are some contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch the bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied some paraplegic patients train themselves to initiate voiding by pinching or stroking their thighs , provoking a mild mass reflex this type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder the reflex hyperactivity is made worse , and may be caused , by infection in the bladder wall due to the positions where the urethra exits the body , males and females often use different techniques for urination most males prefer to urinate standing while others prefer to urinate sitting or squatting elderly males with prostate gland enlargement may benefit from sitting down while in healthy males , no difference is found in the ability to urinate for practising muslim men , the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah hence , urination can take place while sitting or squatting for defecation it is common for women in various regions of africa to use this method when they urinate , as do women in laos females usually sit or squat for urination , depending on what type of toilet they use : a squat toilet is used for urination in a squatting position the urine marking behavior is also most frequent during the mating season , and may play a role in reproductive communication between groups leg-lifting is more common in male wolves than female wolves , although dominant females also use the raised-leg posture urine marking is also associated with pair bonding in coyotes coyotes sometimes urinate on their food , possibly to claim ownership over it black-footed cats use scent marking throughout their ranges , with males spraying urine up to 12 times an hour

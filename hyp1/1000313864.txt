the main organs involved in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra the smooth muscle of the bladder , known as the detrusor , is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacrum spinal cord fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex ; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter , which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the cord , in an area termed onuf 's nucleus smooth muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra , and these fibers are sometimes called the internal urethral sphincter , although they do not encircle the urethra further along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle , the sphincter of the membranous urethra ( external urethral sphincter ) micturition is fundamentally a spinobulbospinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers such as the pontine micturition center and , like defecation , subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition in healthy individuals , the lower urinary tract has two discrete phases of activity : the storage ( or guarding ) phase , when urine is stored in the bladder ; and the voiding phase , when urine is released through the urethra the state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra at low bladder volumes , afferent firing is low , resulting in excitation of the outlet ( the sphincter and urethra ) , and relaxation of the bladder when the individual is ready to urinate , he or she consciously initiates voiding , causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax voiding continues until the bladder empties completely , at which point the bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage the muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems during micturition , parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax the ability to voluntarily inhibit micturition develops by the age of 2â€“3 years , as control at higher levels of the central nervous system develops in the adult , the volume of urine in the bladder that normally initiates a reflex contraction is about during storage , bladder pressure stays low , because of the bladder 's highly compliant nature action potentials carried by sensory neurons from stretch receptors in the urinary bladder wall travel to the sacral segments of the spinal cord through the pelvic nerves since bladder wall stretch is low during the storage phase , these afferent neurons fire at low frequencies low-frequency afferent signals cause relaxation of the bladder by inhibiting sacral parasympathetic preganglionic neurons and exciting lumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons voiding begins when a voluntary signal is sent from the brain to begin urination , and continues until the bladder is empty bladder afferent signals ascend the spinal cord to the periaqueductal gray , where they project both to the pontine micturition center and to the cerebrum the pontine micturition center also causes inhibition of onuf 's nucleus , resulting in relaxation of the external urinary sphincter when the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine is released from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow out of the urethra the flow of urine through the urethra has an overall excitatory role in micturition , which helps sustain voiding until the bladder is empty elsevier after urination , the female urethra empties partially by gravity , with assistance from muscles urine remaining in the male urethra is expelled by several contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscle , and , by some men , manual squeezing along the length of the penis to expel the rest of the urine for smaller mammals a different phenomenon occurs , where urine is discharged as droplets , and urination in smaller mammals , such as mice and rats , can occur in less than a second the mechanism by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled after transection of the brain stem just above the pons , the threshold is lowered and less bladder filling is required to trigger it , whereas after transection at the top of the midbrain , the threshold for the reflex is essentially normal voluntary contraction of the abdominal muscles aids the expulsion of urine by increasing the pressure applied to the urinary bladder wall , but voiding can be initiated without straining even when the bladder is nearly empty the external sphincter can be contracted voluntarily , which will prevent urine from passing down the urethra the need to urinate is experienced as an uncomfortable , full feeling in many males the feeling of the need to urinate can be sensed at the base of the penis as well as the bladder , even though the neural activity associated with a full bladder comes from the bladder itself , and can be felt there as well paruresis , also known as shy bladder syndrome , is an example of a bladder interruption from the brain that often causes total interruption until the person has left a public area the bladder becomes distended , thin-walled , and hypotonic , but there are some contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch gradually , however , the muscle of the '' decentralized bladder '' becomes active , with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra after spinal shock has passed , a spinally mediated voiding reflex ensues , although there is no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers the reflex hyperactivity is made worse , and may be caused , by infection in the bladder wall an alternative method for women to urinate standing is to use a tool known as a female urination device to assist occasionally , if a male 's penis is damaged or removed , or a female 's genitals/urinary tract is damaged , other urination techniques must be used sometimes urination is done in a container such as a bottle , urinal , bedpan , or chamber pot ( also known as a gazunder ) babies have little socialized control over urination within traditions or families that do not practice elimination communication and instead use diapers toilet training is the process of learning to restrict urination to socially approved times and situations it is socially more accepted and more environmentally hygienic for those who are able , to urinate in a toilet public toilets may have urinals , usually for males , although female urinals exist , designed to be used in various ways however , this may leave urine behind in the bladder in one survey , 24 % of women reported involuntary urination during sexual intercourse ; in 66 % of sufferers urination occurred on penetration , while in 33 % urine leakage was restricted to orgasm urine washing , in which urine is rubbed on the hands and feet , is also used by the panamanian night monkey other types of urine-marking in wolves are flu ( flexed-leg urination ) , stu ( standing urination ) , and squ ( squatting urination ) a male fox raises one hind leg and his urine is sprayed forward in front of him , whereas a female fox squats down so that the urine is sprayed in the ground between the hind legs , describes the neurophysiology of urination '' urination '' at howstuffworks.com

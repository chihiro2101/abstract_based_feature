when medical institutions explain dnr , they describe survival from cpr , in order to address patients ' concerns about outcomes after cpr outside hospitals in 2018 , 8,000 patients survived to leave the hospital alive , out of 80,000 cpr attempts , or 10 % in information on dnr , medical institutions compare survival for patients with multiple chronic illnesses ; patients with heart , lung or kidney disease ; liver disease ; widespread cancer or infection ; and residents of nursing homes research shows that cpr survival is the same as the average cpr survival rate , or nearly so , for patients with multiple chronic illnesses , or diabetes , heart or lung diseases in health facilities and nursing homes where aeds are available and used , survival rates are twice as high as the average survival found in nursing homes overall research on 26,000 patients found similarities in the health situations of patients with and without dnrs for each of 10 levels of illness , from healthiest to sickest , 7 % to 36 % of patients had dnr orders ; the rest had full code as noted above , patients considering dnr mention the risks of cpr after cpr , up to 1 more person , among each 100 survivors , is in a coma than before cpr ( and most people come out of comas ) outside hospitals , half a percent more survivors were in comas after cpr ( 0.5 % before , 1 % after ) , 10 % more survivors were dependent on other people because of mental problems , and 21 % more had moderate mental problems which still let them stay independent organ donation is possible after cpr , but not usually after a death with a dnr some patients choose dnr because they prefer less care : half of oregon patients with dnr orders who filled out a polst the uae have laws forcing healthcare staff to resuscitate a patient even if the patient has a dnr or does not wish to live patients may also specify their wishes and/or devolve their decision-making to a proxy using an advance directive , which are commonly referred to as 'living wills ' , or an emergency care and treatment plan ( ectp ) , such as respect in 2020 the care quality commission found that residents of care homes had been given inappropriate orders of do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( dnacpr ) without notice to residents or their families , causing avoidable deaths medical providers have said that any discussion with patients and families is not in reference to consent to resuscitation and instead should be an explanation patients and families can not demand cpr to be performed if it is felt to be futile ( as with any medical treatment ) and a dnacpr can be issued despite disagreement , although it is good practice to involve all parties in the discussion dnr orders must be discussed by doctors with the patient or patient agents or patient 's significant others in nsw , a resuscitation plan is a medically authorised order to use or withhold resuscitation measures , and which documents other aspects of treatment relevant at end of life without the expression of any preference by the patient , physicians must attempt to resuscitate all patients regardless of familial wishes two witnesses must also be present in order for a dnr to be signed

interviews with 26 dnr patients and 16 full code patients in toronto in 2006-9 suggest that the decision to choose do-not-resuscitate status was based on personal factors including health and lifestyle ; relational factors ( to family or to society as a whole ) ; and philosophical factors when medical institutions explain dnr , they describe survival from cpr , in order to address patients ' concerns about outcomes after cpr in hospitals in 2017 , 7,000 patients survived to leave the hospital alive , out of 26,000 cpr attempts , or 26 % after cpr outside hospitals in 2018 , 8,000 patients survived to leave the hospital alive , out of 80,000 cpr attempts , or 10 % success was 21 % in a public setting , where someone was more likely to see the person collapse and give help than in a home research shows that cpr survival is the same as the average cpr survival rate , or nearly so , for patients with multiple chronic illnesses , or diabetes , heart or lung diseases in health facilities and nursing homes where aeds are available and used , survival rates are twice as high as the average survival found in nursing homes overall as noted above , patients considering dnr mention the risks of cpr after cpr , up to 1 more person , among each 100 survivors , is in a coma than before cpr ( and most people come out of comas ) organ donation is possible after cpr , but not usually after a death with a dnr donations can be taken from 40 % of patients who have rosc and later become brain dead , and an average of 3 organs are taken from each patient who donates organs in england and wales , cpr is presumed in the event of a cardiac arrest unless a do not resuscitate order is in place evaluation of respect ( an ectp ) found that resuscitation status remained a central component of conversations , and that there was variability in the discussion of other emergency treatments in 2021 the mencap charity found that people with learning disabilities also had inappropriate dnacpr orders medical providers have said that any discussion with patients and families is not in reference to consent to resuscitation and instead should be an explanation patients and families can not demand cpr to be performed if it is felt to be futile ( as with any medical treatment ) and a dnacpr can be issued despite disagreement , although it is good practice to involve all parties in the discussion in victoria , a refusal of medical treatment certificate is a legal means to refuse medical treatments of current medical conditions an advanced care directive legally defines the medical treatments that a person may choose to receive ( or not to receive ) in various defined circumstances however , one study looking at insights into chinese perspectives on dnr showed that the majority of dnr orders in taiwan were signed by surrogates typically , the time period between signing the dnr and death is very short , showing that signing a dnr in taiwan is typically delayed two witnesses must also be present in order for a dnr to be signed

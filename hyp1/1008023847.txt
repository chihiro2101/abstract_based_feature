by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in halifax , including patrol ships , tugboats , and minesweepers hospital ships brought the wounded to the city , and a new military hospital was constructed in the city all neutral ships bound for ports in north america were required to report to halifax for inspection the norwegian ship had sailed from the netherlands en route to new york to take on relief supplies for belgium , under the command of haakon from though she had been given clearance to leave the port on 5 december , imos departure was delayed because her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon the french cargo ship arrived from new york late on 5 december , under the command of aim√© le medec ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war , but the risks posed by german submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations navigating into or out of bedford basin required passage through a strait called the narrows ships were expected to keep close to the lateral mark situated on their starboard ( '' right '' ) , and pass oncoming vessels '' port to port '' , that is to keep them on their '' left '' side firefighters were among the first to respond to the disaster , rushing to mont-blanc to attempt to extinguish the blaze before the explosion even occurred they also played a role after the blast , with fire companies arriving to assist from across halifax , and by the end of the day from as far away as amherst , nova scotia , and moncton , new brunswick , on relief trains halifax fire department 's west street station 2 was the first to arrive at pier 6 with the crew of the patricia , the first motorized fire engine in canada royal navy cruisers in port sent some of the first organized rescue parties ashore spotting the large and rising column of smoke , tacoma altered course and arrived to assist rescue at 2 & nbsp ; pm troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack , but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined all available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the north end to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city 's hospitals , including the two army hospitals in the city adding to the chaos were fears of a potential second explosion the fire was quickly put out ; the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent surviving railway workers in the railyards at the heart of the disaster carried out rescue work , pulling people from the harbour and from under debris it continued into richmond until the track was blocked by wreckage the train was loaded with injured and left the city at 1:30 with a doctor aboard , to evacuate the wounded to truro the commission would continue until 1976 , participating in reconstruction and relief efforts and later distributing pensions to survivors to reach the wounded , rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets relief efforts were hampered the following day by a blizzard that blanketed halifax with of heavy snow trains en route from other parts of canada and from the united states were stalled in snowdrifts , and telegraph lines that had been hastily repaired following the explosion were again knocked down the halifax explosion remembrance book , an official database of the nova scotia archives and records management , identified 1,782 victims dartmouth was not as densely populated as halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour , but still suffered heavy damage windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed , including the oland brewery and parts of the starr manufacturing company in the years and months preceding the explosion , the department of indian affairs had been actively trying to force the mi'kmaq to give up their land , but this had not occurred by the time of the explosion efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris , repair buildings , and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion the canadian government railways created a special unit to clear and repair railway yards as well as rebuild railway piers and the naval dockyard construction began in 1964 on the halifax north memorial library , designed to commemorate the victims of the explosion a memorial book listing the names of all the known victims is displayed at the halifax north memorial library and at the maritime museum of the atlantic , which has a large permanent exhibit about the halifax explosion

dartmouth lies on the east shore of halifax harbour , and halifax is on the west shore by 1917 , '' halifax 's inner harbour had become a principal assembly point for merchant convoys leaving for britain and france the canadian government took over the halifax dockyard ( now cfb halifax ) from the royal navy just before the world war i , the canadian government began a determined , costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities in 1915 , management of the harbour fell under the control of the royal canadian navy under the supervision of captain superintendent edward harrington martin ; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in halifax , including patrol ships , tugboats , and minesweepers merchant ships gathered at bedford basin on the northwestern end of the harbour , which was protected by two sets of anti-submarine nets and guarded by patrol ships of the royal canadian navy the norwegian ship had sailed from the netherlands en route to new york to take on relief supplies for belgium , under the command of haakon from the ship arrived in halifax on 3 december for neutral inspection and spent two days in bedford basin awaiting refuelling supplies though she had been given clearance to leave the port on 5 december , imos departure was delayed because her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon the french cargo ship arrived from new york late on 5 december , under the command of aim√© le medec ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war , but the risks posed by german submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations the new military hospital , camp hill , admitted approximately 1,400 victims on 6 december firefighters were among the first to respond to the disaster , rushing to mont-blanc to attempt to extinguish the blaze before the explosion even occurred they also played a role after the blast , with fire companies arriving to assist from across halifax , and by the end of the day from as far away as amherst , nova scotia , and moncton , new brunswick , on relief trains halifax fire department 's west street station 2 was the first to arrive at pier 6 with the crew of the patricia , the first motorized fire engine in canada a us coast guard cutter , , also sent a rescue party ashore the american steamship old colony , docked in halifax for repairs , suffered little damage and was quickly converted to serve as a hospital ship , staffed by doctors and orderlies from the british and american navy vessels in the harbour dazed survivors immediately feared that the explosion was the result of a bomb dropped from a german plane all available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the north end to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city 's hospitals , including the two army hospitals in the city the fire was quickly put out ; the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent as the rumour spread across the city , many families fled their homes many rescuers ignored the evacuation , and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour led by lieutenant governor maccallum grant , leading citizens formed the halifax relief commission at around noon community facilities like the ymca were rapidly converted to emergency hospital facilities with medical students providing care rescue trains were dispatched from across atlantic canada , as well as the northeastern united states to reach the wounded , rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets the city 's industrial sector was in large part gone , with many workers among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged dartmouth was not as densely populated as halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour , but still suffered heavy damage nova scotia hospital was the only hospital in dartmouth and many of the victims were treated there directly opposite to pier 9 on the halifax side sat a community in tufts cove , also known as turtle grove the physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami africville received little of the donated relief funds and none of the progressive reconstruction invested in other parts of the city after the explosion the halifax herald continued to propagate this belief for some time , for example reporting that germans had mocked victims of the explosion efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris , repair buildings , and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion the canadian government railways created a special unit to clear and repair railway yards as well as rebuild railway piers and the naval dockyard the north end halifax neighbourhood of richmond bore the brunt of the explosion fragments of mont-blanc have been mounted as neighbourhood monuments to the explosion at albro lake road in dartmouth , at regatta point , and elsewhere in the area keith ross leckie scripted a miniseries entitled shattered city : the halifax explosion ( 2003 ) , which took the title but has no relationship to janet kitz 's non-fiction book shattered city : the halifax explosion and the road to recovery ( 1990 ) eyewitness account of the halifax explosion the washington times december 19,1917 p.8

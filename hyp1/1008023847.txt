by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in halifax , including patrol ships , tugboats , and minesweepers the two main points of departure were in nova scotia at sydney , on cape breton island , and halifax merchant ships gathered at bedford basin on the northwestern end of the harbour , which was protected by two sets of anti-submarine nets and guarded by patrol ships of the royal canadian navy the norwegian ship had sailed from the netherlands en route to new york to take on relief supplies for belgium , under the command of haakon from the ship arrived in halifax on 3 december for neutral inspection and spent two days in bedford basin awaiting refuelling supplies though she had been given clearance to leave the port on 5 december , imos departure was delayed because her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon the french cargo ship arrived from new york late on 5 december , under the command of aim√© le medec a flood of victims soon began to arrive at the city 's hospitals , which were quickly overwhelmed halifax fire department 's west street station 2 was the first to arrive at pier 6 with the crew of the patricia , the first motorized fire engine in canada dazed survivors immediately feared that the explosion was the result of a bomb dropped from a german plane the fire was quickly put out ; the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent led by lieutenant governor maccallum grant , leading citizens formed the halifax relief commission at around noon the committee organized members in charge of organizing medical relief for both halifax and dartmouth , supplying transportation , food and shelter , and covering medical and funeral costs for victims the commission would continue until 1976 , participating in reconstruction and relief efforts and later distributing pensions to survivors the first left truro around 10 & nbsp ;

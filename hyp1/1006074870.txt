friedman was born wolf friedman , , in chişinău , bessarabia , the son of frederick friedman , a jew from bucharest who worked as a translator and linguist for the russian postal service , and the daughter of a well-to-do wine merchant friedman : principal cryptologist '' three years later , his first name was changed to william friedman had become something of an expert photographer while working on his other projects , and was asked to travel to england on several occasions to help gallup photograph historical manuscripts during her research they married , and he soon became director of riverbank 's department of codes and ciphers as well as its department of genetics during this time , friedman wrote a series of 8 papers on cryptography , collectively known as the '' riverbank publications '' , including the first description of the index of coincidence , an important mathematical tool in cryptanalysis with the entry of the united states into world war i , fabyan offered the services of his department of codes and ciphers to the government no federal department existed for this kind of work ( although both the army and navy had had embryonic departments at various times ) , and soon riverbank became the unofficial cryptographic center for the us government analyzing the format of the messages , riverbank realized that the code was based on a dictionary of some sort , a cryptographic technique common at the time the united states government decided to set up its own cryptological service , and sent army officers to riverbank to train under friedman he returned to the us in 1920 and published an eighth monograph , '' the index of coincidence and its applications in cryptography '' , considered by some to be the most important publication in modern cryptography to that time one of these ( written mostly in his spare time ) was the first draft of his elements of cryptanalysis , which later was expanded to four volumes and became the u.s during this period elizebeth friedman continued her own work in cryptology , and became famous in a number of trials involving rum-runners and the coast guard and fbi during prohibition left during the 1920s , several new cipher machines were developed generally based on using typewriter mechanics and basic electrical circuitry examples of some dangerous features which allowed cracking of the generated code included having rotors step one position with each keypress , and putting the fastest rotor ( the one that turns with every keypress ) at either end of the rotor series friedman used his understanding of rotor machines to develop several that were immune to his own attacks the navy 's cryptological unit ( op-20-g ) and the sis thought it might be related to earlier japanese cipher machines , and agreed that sis would handle the attack on the system following world war ii , friedman remained in government signals intelligence friedman has been inducted into the military intelligence hall of fame and there is a building named after william and elizebeth at the nsa complex at fort george g barbara friedman ( later atchison ) ( born 1923 ) , and john ramsay friedman ( 1926–2010 )

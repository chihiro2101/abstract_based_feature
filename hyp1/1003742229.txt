study of rock exposures and drillholes demonstrates that no displacement of the rock layers occurs at the escarpment , which is not a fault line but the result of unequal erosion the escarpment 's caprock is dolomitic limestone , also known as dolostone , which is more resistant and overlies weaker , more easily eroded shale as a weathering-resistant '' cap '' the escarpment formed over millions of years through a process of differential erosion of these rocks of different hardnesses it can also be seen at the three genesee river at rochester ( additional resistant rock layers make more than one escarpment in some places ) also , in some places thick glacial deposits , such as the oak ridges moraine , conceal the niagara escarpment , such as north of georgetown , ontario , where it actually continues under glacial till and reappears farther north the welland canal allows ships to traverse the escarpment between lake erie and lake ontario on the niagara peninsula of ontario niagara county , new york , near the eastern end of the escarpment , is the site of the niagara escarpment ava ( american viticultural area ) three subappellations lie along the benchlands of the niagara escarpment : short hills bench , twenty mile bench , and beamsville bench development and land use on and adjacent to the escarpment is regulated by the niagara escarpment commission , an agency of the ontario government cliffs along the niagara escarpment have the oldest forest ecosystem in eastern north america

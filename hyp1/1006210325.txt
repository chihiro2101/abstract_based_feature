and walter burkert both argue for a connection with the akkadian word for sea , tâmtu ( 𒀀𒀊𒁀 ) , following an early form , ti'amtum the later form , which appears in the hellenistic babylonian writer berossus ' first volume of universal history , is clearly related to greek , an eastern variant of it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of enûma elish substituted the ordinary word tāmtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association tiamat also has been claimed to be cognate with northwest semitic tehom ( תְּהוֹם ) ( '' the deeps , abyss '' ) , in the book of genesis 1:2 the babylonian epic enuma elish is named for its incipit : '' when above '' the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below , apsu the subterranean ocean was there , '' the first , the begetter '' , and tiamat , the overground sea , '' she who bore them all '' ; they were '' mixing their waters '' it is thought that female deities are older than male ones in mesopotamia and tiamat may have begun as part of the cult of nammu , a female principle of a watery creative force , with equally strong connections to the underworld , which predates the appearance of ea-enki tiamat is usually described as a sea serpent or dragon , although assyriologist alexander heidel disagreed with this identification and argued that '' dragon form can not be imputed to tiamat with certainty '' other scholars have disregarded heidel 's argument : joseph fontenrose in particular found it '' not convincing '' and concluded that '' there is reason to believe that tiamat was sometimes , not necessarily always , conceived as a dragoness '' the enûma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such the depiction of tiamat ( dungeons & dragons ) was popularized in the 1970s as a fixture of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game inspired by earlier sources associating tiamat with later mythological characters such as lotan ( leviathan ) in the myth recorded on cuneiform , the deity enki ( later ea ) believed correctly that apsu was planning to murder the younger deities , upset with the noisy tumult they created , and so captured him and held him prisoner beneath his temple , the e-abzu ( '' temple of abzu '' ) '' this surmise that the babylonian version of the story is based upon a modified version of an older epic , in which enlil , not marduk , was the god who slew tiamat , expressed , for example , in e martkheel according to some analyses there are two parts to the tiamat myth , the first in which tiamat is creator goddess , through a '' sacred marriage '' between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations tiamat is one of the playable gods in the moba smite , the first mage released in 2021

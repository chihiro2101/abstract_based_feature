and walter burkert both argue for a connection with the akkadian word for sea , t√¢mtu ( íÄÄíÄäíÅÄ ) , following an early form , ti'amtum it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of en√ªma elish substituted the ordinary word tƒÅmtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association the babylonian epic enuma elish is named for its incipit : '' when above '' the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below , apsu the subterranean ocean was there , '' the first , the begetter '' , and tiamat , the overground sea , '' she who bore them all '' ; they were '' mixing their waters '' tiamat is usually described as a sea serpent or dragon , although assyriologist alexander heidel disagreed with this identification and argued that '' dragon form can not be imputed to tiamat with certainty '' the en√ªma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such the depiction of tiamat ( dungeons & dragons ) was popularized in the 1970s as a fixture of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game inspired by earlier sources associating tiamat with later mythological characters such as lotan ( leviathan ) tiamat was the '' shining '' personification of the sea who roared and smote in the chaos of original creation this angered kingu , their son , who reported the event to tiamat , whereupon she fashioned eleven monsters to battle the deities in order to avenge apsu 's death tiamat possessed the tablet of destinies and in the primordial battle she gave them to kingu , the deity she had chosen as her lover and the leader of her host , and who was also one of her children anu was later replaced by enlil and , in the late version that has survived after the first dynasty of babylon , by marduk , the son of ea '' this surmise that the babylonian version of the story is based upon a modified version of an older epic , in which enlil , not marduk , was the god who slew tiamat , expressed , for example , in e martkheel according to some analyses there are two parts to the tiamat myth , the first in which tiamat is creator goddess , through a '' sacred marriage '' between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations the five headed dragon goddess in the dungeons & dragons game is named tiamat , and stars as one of the primary antagonists in the dungeons & dragons tv series tiamat is one of the playable gods in the moba smite , the first mage released in 2021

and walter burkert both argue for a connection with the akkadian word for sea , t√¢mtu ( íÄÄíÄäíÅÄ ) , following an early form , ti'amtum the later form , which appears in the hellenistic babylonian writer berossus ' first volume of universal history , is clearly related to greek , an eastern variant of it is thought that the proper name ti'amat , which is the construct or vocative form , was dropped in secondary translations of the original texts because some akkadian copyists of en√ªma elish substituted the ordinary word tƒÅmtu ( '' sea '' ) for tiamat , the two names having become essentially the same due to association the babylonian epic enuma elish is named for its incipit : '' when above '' the heavens did not yet exist nor the earth below , apsu the subterranean ocean was there , '' the first , the begetter '' , and tiamat , the overground sea , '' she who bore them all '' ; they were '' mixing their waters '' tiamat is usually described as a sea serpent or dragon , although assyriologist alexander heidel disagreed with this identification and argued that '' dragon form can not be imputed to tiamat with certainty '' the en√ªma elish states that tiamat gave birth to dragons and serpents among a more general list of monsters including scorpion men and mermaid , but does not identify her form as that of a dragon ; however , other sources containing the same myth do refer to her as such the depiction of tiamat ( dungeons & dragons ) was popularized in the 1970s as a fixture of the dungeons & dragons roleplaying game inspired by earlier sources associating tiamat with later mythological characters such as lotan ( leviathan ) abzu ( or aps√ª ) fathered upon tiamat the elder deities lahmu and lahamu ( masc in the myth recorded on cuneiform , the deity enki ( later ea ) believed correctly that apsu was planning to murder the younger deities , upset with the noisy tumult they created , and so captured him and held him prisoner beneath his temple , the e-abzu ( '' temple of abzu '' ) tiamat possessed the tablet of destinies and in the primordial battle she gave them to kingu , the deity she had chosen as her lover and the leader of her host , and who was also one of her children martkheel according to some analyses there are two parts to the tiamat myth , the first in which tiamat is creator goddess , through a '' sacred marriage '' between different waters , peacefully creating the cosmos through successive generations graves ' ideas were later developed into the great goddess theory by marija gimbutas , merlin stone and others the five headed dragon goddess in the dungeons & dragons game is named tiamat , and stars as one of the primary antagonists in the dungeons & dragons tv series in bruce coville 's jeremy thatcher , dragon hatcher ( from the magic shop series ) , a boy is given a dragon egg from elias 's magic shop and names the dragon tiamat , with whom he develops a mental connection

chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von nägeli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents 1-32in russian the subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of c 2nd ed , revised and enlarged , 1958 the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes chromosomes alec macandrew ; accessed 18 may 2006 evidence of common ancestry : human chromosome 2 ( video ) 2007 the study of karyotypes is made possible by staining sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells the sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells ( see amniocentesis and barr body ) six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread differences in degree and distribution of heterochromatin regions the staining technique using giemsa staining is called g banding and therefore produces the typical '' g-bands '' a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes some variations in karyotype , whether to autosomes or allosomes , cause chromosome abnormalities in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost in placental mammals , the inactivation is random as between the two xs ; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her x chromosomes the number of chromosomes in the karyotype between ( relatively ) unrelated species is hugely variable the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes thus , fn ≤ 2 x 2n , the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed ( acrocentric or telocentric ) present ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell polyploidy , where there are more than two sets of homologous chromosomes in the cells , occurs mainly in plants endopolyploidy occurs when in adult differentiated tissues the cells have ceased to divide by mitosis , but the nuclei contain more than the original somatic number of chromosomes in the endocycle ( endomitosis or endoreduplication ) chromosomes in a 'resting ' nucleus undergo reduplication , the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an intact nuclear membrane the cells do not always contain exact multiples ( powers of two ) , which is why the simple definition 'an increase in the number of chromosome sets caused by replication without cell division ' is not quite accurate the phenomenon occurs sporadically throughout the eukaryote kingdom from protozoa to humans ; it is diverse and complex , and serves differentiation and morphogenesis in many ways aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species evidence of various kinds shows that trends of evolution have gone in different directions in different groups bands are alternating light and dark stripes that appear along the lengths of chromosomes unique banding patterns are used to identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations , including chromosome breakage , loss , duplication , translocation or inverted segments each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them ; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern because there are a limited number of spectrally distinct fluorophores , a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors chromosomal abnormalities that lead to disease in humans include turner syndrome results from a single x chromosome ( 45 , x or 45 , x0 ) 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1

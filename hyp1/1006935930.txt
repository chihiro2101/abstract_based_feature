their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents comparative karyological study of species muscari mill considering the techniques of the time , these results were remarkable the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes alec macandrew ; accessed 18 may 2006 evidence of common ancestry : human chromosome 2 ( video ) 2007 for humans , white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture the association of cytogenetic technologists , raven press , new york sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family for example , the legumes lotus tenuis and vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes , yet v these differences probably arose from segmental interchange of unequal lengths differences in basic number of chromosomes humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread differences in degree and distribution of heterochromatin regions euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes some variations in karyotype , whether to autosomes or allosomes , cause chromosome abnormalities although the replication and transcription of dna is highly standardized in eukaryotes , the same can not be said for their karyotypes , which are highly variable there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin this variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary cytology in some cases there is even significant variation within species in placental mammals , the inactivation is random as between the two xs ; thus the mammalian female is a mosaic in respect of her x chromosomes . number of chromosomes in a set a spectacular example of variability between closely related species is the muntjac , which was investigated by kurt benirschke and doris wurster the diploid number of the chinese muntjac , muntiacus reevesi , was found to be 46 , all telocentric the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum at 372 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes polyploidy in animals is much less common , but it has been significant in some groups in the endocycle ( endomitosis or endoreduplication ) chromosomes in a 'resting ' nucleus undergo reduplication , the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an intact nuclear membrane in many instances , endopolyploid nuclei contain tens of thousands of chromosomes ( which can not be exactly counted ) this would give rise to a chromosome abnormality such as an extra chromosome or one or more chromosomes lost each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them ; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern chromosomal abnormalities that lead to disease in humans include turner syndrome results from a single x chromosome ( 45 , x or 45 , x0 ) 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1

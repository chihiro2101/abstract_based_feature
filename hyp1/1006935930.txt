chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von n√§geli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents 1-32in russian the subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of c painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48 , at first favoring 46 , but revised his opinion from 46 to 48 , and he correctly insisted on humans having an xx/xy system the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes evidence of common ancestry : human chromosome 2 ( video ) 2007 the study of karyotypes is made possible by staining sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells the sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells ( see amniocentesis and barr body ) chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family for example , the legumes lotus tenuis and vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes , yet v differences in relative size of chromosomes differences in basic number of chromosomes humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread differences in degree and distribution of heterochromatin regions euchromatin is usually under active transcription and stains much lighter as it has less affinity for the giemsa stain thompson & thompson genetics in medicine 7th ed euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of guanine-cytosine pairs the staining technique using giemsa staining is called g banding and therefore produces the typical '' g-bands '' approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes some variations in karyotype , whether to autosomes or allosomes , cause chromosome abnormalities although the replication and transcription of dna is highly standardized in eukaryotes , the same can not be said for their karyotypes , which are highly variable in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost . number of chromosomes in a set a spectacular example of variability between closely related species is the muntjac , which was investigated by kurt benirschke and doris wurster the diploid number of the chinese muntjac , muntiacus reevesi , was found to be 46 , all telocentric the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell polyploidy in animals is much less common , but it has been significant in some groups polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid endopolyploidy and polyteny in differentiation and evolution : towards an understanding of quantitative and qualitative variation of nuclear dna in ontogeny and phylogeny chromosomes display a banded pattern when treated with some stains heterochromatin binds a lot of the dye , while the rest of the chromosomes absorb only little of it in other words : the properties of the bonds and the specificity of the fluorochromes are not exclusively based on their affinity to regions rich in at each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them ; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern down syndrome , a common chromosomal disease , is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1

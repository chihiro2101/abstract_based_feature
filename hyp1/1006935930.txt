chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von n√§geli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents comparative karyological study of species muscari mill bulletin of the tiflis botanical garden the other great apes have 48 chromosomes human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes alec macandrew ; accessed 18 may 2006 sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family faba chromosomes are many times larger these differences probably reflect different amounts of dna duplication differences in relative size of chromosomes humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes heterochromatin consists mainly of genetically inactive and repetitive dna sequences as well as containing a larger amount of adenine-thymine pairs a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy there is variation between species in chromosome number , and in detailed organization , despite their construction from the same chromatin in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development in this process , found in some copepods and roundworms such as ascaris suum , portions of the chromosomes are cast away in particular cells this process is a carefully organised genome rearrangement where new telomeres are constructed and certain heterochromatin regions are lost sinauer associates , stamford ct when they looked at the karyotype of the closely related indian muntjac , muntiacus muntjak , they were astonished to find it had female 6 , male 7 chromosomes the number of chromosomes in the karyotype between ( relatively ) unrelated species is hugely variable top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum at 372 chromosomes humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) polyploidy , where there are more than two sets of homologous chromosomes in the cells , occurs mainly in plants haplo-diploidy , where one sex is diploid , and the other haploid see paleopolyploidy for the investigation of ancient karyotype duplications aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species down syndrome and turner syndrome are examples of this aneuploidy may also occur within a group of closely related species evidence of various kinds shows that trends of evolution have gone in different directions in different groups p18 in primates , the great apes have 24x2 chromosomes whereas humans have 23x2 for example , cri du chat syndrome involves a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 edwards syndrome is caused by trisomy ( three copies ) of chromosome 18 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1

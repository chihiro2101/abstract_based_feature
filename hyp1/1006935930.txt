chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von nägeli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents and michael jd white painter in 1922 was not certain whether the diploid of humans was 46 or 48 , at first favoring 46 , but revised his opinion from 46 to 48 , and he correctly insisted on humans having an xx/xy system the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes human chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral the association of cytogenetic technologists , raven press , new york sometimes observations may be made on non-dividing ( interphase ) cells the sex of an unborn fetus can be determined by observation of interphase cells ( see amniocentesis and barr body ) six different characteristics of karyotypes are usually observed and compared : differences in absolute sizes of chromosomes chromosomes can vary in absolute size by as much as twenty-fold between genera of the same family for example , the legumes lotus tenuis and vicia faba each have six pairs of chromosomes , yet v differences in basic number of chromosomes humans have one pair fewer chromosomes than the great apes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread heterochromatin stains darker than euchromatin heterochromatin is packed tighter the staining technique using giemsa staining is called g banding and therefore produces the typical '' g-bands '' a full account of a karyotype may therefore include the number , type , shape and banding of the chromosomes , as well as other cytogenetic information the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy although the replication and transcription of dna is highly standardized in eukaryotes , the same can not be said for their karyotypes , which are highly variable this variation provides the basis for a range of studies in evolutionary cytology . number of chromosomes in a set a spectacular example of variability between closely related species is the muntjac , which was investigated by kurt benirschke and doris wurster the high record would be somewhere amongst the ferns , with the adder 's tongue fern ophioglossum ahead with an average of 1262 chromosomes the fundamental number , fn , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of chromosomes thus , fn ≤ 2 x 2n , the difference depending on the number of chromosomes considered single-armed ( acrocentric or telocentric ) present humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) the fundamental autosomal number or autosomal fundamental number , fna or an , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of autosomes ( non-allosome ) ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell the proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by stebbins to be 30–35 % , but in grasses the average is much higher , about 70 % haplo-diploidy , where one sex is diploid , and the other haploid endopolyploidy occurs when in adult differentiated tissues the cells have ceased to divide by mitosis , but the nuclei contain more than the original somatic number of chromosomes in the endocycle ( endomitosis or endoreduplication ) chromosomes in a 'resting ' nucleus undergo reduplication , the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an intact nuclear membrane aneuploidy is the condition in which the chromosome number in the cells is not the typical number for the species human chromosome 2 was formed by a merger of ancestral chromosomes , reducing the number each chromosome has a characteristic banding pattern that helps to identify them ; both chromosomes in a pair will have the same banding pattern

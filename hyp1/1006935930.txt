history of karyotype studies chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by carl wilhelm von nägeli in 1842 their behavior in animal ( salamander ) cells was described by walther flemming , the discoverer of mitosis , in 1882 the name was coined by another german anatomist , heinrich von waldeyer in 1888 in 1922 seems to have been the first person to define the karyotype as the phenotypic appearance of the somatic chromosomes , in contrast to their gene contents 1-32in russian the subsequent history of the concept can be followed in the works of c the karyotype of humans includes only 46 chromosomes human and mammalian cytogenetics : a historical perspective human chromosome 2 is now known to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral ape chromosomes evidence of common ancestry : human chromosome 2 ( video ) 2007 for humans , white blood cells are used most frequently because they are easily induced to divide and grow in tissue culture in the act cytogenetics laboratory manual 2nd ed , ed the association of cytogenetic technologists , raven press , new york differences in relative size of chromosomes human chromosome 2 appears to have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes , and many of the genes of those two original chromosomes have been translocated to other chromosomes satellites are small bodies attached to a chromosome by a thin thread thompson & thompson genetics in medicine 7th ed euchromatin regions contain larger amounts of guanine-cytosine pairs the staining technique using giemsa staining is called g banding and therefore produces the typical '' g-bands '' the typical human karyotypes contain 22 pairs of autosome chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes ( allosomes ) the most common karyotypes for females contain two x chromosomes and are denoted 46 , xx ; males usually have both an x and a y chromosome denoted 46 , xy approximately 1.7 % percent of humans are intersex , sometimes due to variations in sex chromosomes in some species , as in many sciaridae , entire chromosomes are eliminated during development suum , all the somatic cell precursors undergo chromatin diminution the inactivation of one x chromosome takes place during the early development of mammals ( see barr body and dosage compensation ) . number of chromosomes in a set the number of chromosomes in the karyotype between ( relatively ) unrelated species is hugely variable the low record is held by the nematode parascaris univalens , where the haploid n 1 ; and an ant : myrmecia pilosula top score for animals might be the shortnose sturgeon acipenser brevirostrum at 372 chromosomes humans have fn 82 , due to the presence of five acrocentric chromosome pairs : 13 , 14 , 15 , 21 , and 22 ( the human y chromosome is also acrocentric ) the fundamental autosomal number or autosomal fundamental number , fna or an , of a karyotype is the number of visible major chromosomal arms per set of autosomes ( non-allosome ) ploidy is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell the proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by stebbins to be 30–35 % , but in grasses the average is much higher , about 70 % polyploidy in lower plants ( ferns , horsetails and psilotales ) is also common , and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants endopolyploidy occurs when in adult differentiated tissues the cells have ceased to divide by mitosis , but the nuclei contain more than the original somatic number of chromosomes in the endocycle ( endomitosis or endoreduplication ) chromosomes in a 'resting ' nucleus undergo reduplication , the daughter chromosomes separating from each other inside an intact nuclear membrane the phenomenon occurs sporadically throughout the eukaryote kingdom from protozoa to humans ; it is diverse and complex , and serves differentiation and morphogenesis in many ways this would give rise to a chromosome abnormality such as an extra chromosome or one or more chromosomes lost abnormalities in chromosome number usually cause a defect in development there are also cases of colonization back to older islands , and skipping of islands , but these are much less frequent the dark regions are euchromatic ( guanine-cytosine rich regions ) and the bright regions are heterochromatic ( thymine-adenine rich regions ) klinefelter syndrome , the most common male chromosomal disease , otherwise known as 47 , xxy , is caused by an extra x chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome , from the loss of part of the short arm of chromosome 1

typically the first organism splits into two daughter organisms , who then each split to form four , who split to form eight , and so on because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate , it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state a virus ( for example covid-19 , or smallpox ) typically will spread exponentially at first , if no artificial immunization is available the resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete dielectric breakdown of the material '' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations economic growth is expressed in percentage terms , implying exponential growth compound interest at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital ) in computational complexity theory , computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources ( e.g time , computer memory ) for only a constant increase in problem size there is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear ( in the long run ) in the most extreme case , when growth increases without bound in finite time , it is called hyperbolic growth in reality , initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever exponential growth bias is the tendency to underestimate compound growth processes day after day , the plant 's growth is small , so it is decided that it wo n't be a concern until it covers half of the pond growth in a finite world – sustainability and the exponential function — presentation dr

the number of microorganisms in a culture will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted typically the first organism splits into two daughter organisms , who then each split to form four , who split to form eight , and so on because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate , it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state a virus ( for example covid-19 , or smallpox ) typically will spread exponentially at first , if no artificial immunization is available the resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete dielectric breakdown of the material it is a reasonable approximation to think of the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual explosion , which only takes 3–4 generations economic growth is expressed in percentage terms , implying exponential growth compound interest at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital the link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist ray kurzweil time , computer memory ) for only a constant increase in problem size in between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior , like the hyperoperations beginning at tetration , and a ( n , n ) , the diagonal of the ackermann function in reality , initial exponential growth is often not sustained forever french children are offered a riddle , which shows an aspect of exponential growth : '' the apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit '' ( 1972 ) the limits to growth growth in a finite world – sustainability and the exponential function — presentation dr

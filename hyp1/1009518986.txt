the number of microorganisms in a culture will increase exponentially until an essential nutrient is exhausted typically the first organism splits into two daughter organisms , who then each split to form four , who split to form eight , and so on because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate , it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state '' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations economic growth is expressed in percentage terms , implying exponential growth compound interest at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital so for an algorithm of time complexity 2 x , if a problem of size requires 10 seconds to complete , and a problem of size requires 20 seconds , then a problem of size will require 40 seconds if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t , then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x + constant in the same time t a quantity x depends exponentially on time t if : x ( t ) a\cdot b^ 0 growth rates may also be faster than exponential in the most extreme case , when growth increases without bound in finite time , it is called hyperbolic growth in 1845 , the belgian mathematician pierre françois verhulst first proposed a mathematical model of growth like this , called the '' logistic curve '' exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions , as unbounded growth is not physically realistic & nbsp ; 367–9 growth in a finite world – sustainability and the exponential function — presentation dr

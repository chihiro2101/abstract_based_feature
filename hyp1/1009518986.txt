because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate , it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state however , cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism and gene expression a virus ( for example covid-19 , or smallpox ) typically will spread exponentially at first , if no artificial immunization is available the resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete dielectric breakdown of the material '' positive feedback within the linear range of electrical or electroacoustic amplifier can result in the exponential growth of the amplified signal , although resonance effects may favor some component frequency of the signal over others economic growth is expressed in percentage terms , implying exponential growth the link of this hypothetical concept with exponential growth is most vocally made by futurist ray kurzweil ) in computational complexity theory , computer algorithms of exponential complexity require an exponentially increasing amount of resources ( e.g so for an algorithm of time complexity 2 x , if a problem of size requires 10 seconds to complete , and a problem of size requires 20 seconds , then a problem of size will require 40 seconds if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t , then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x + constant in the same time t there is a whole hierarchy of conceivable growth rates that are slower than exponential and faster than linear ( in the long run ) growth rates may also be faster than exponential exponential growth models of physical phenomena only apply within limited regions , as unbounded growth is not physically realistic french children are offered a riddle , which shows an aspect of exponential growth : '' the apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit '' growth in a finite world – sustainability and the exponential function — presentation dr

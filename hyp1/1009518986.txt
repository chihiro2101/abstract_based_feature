because exponential growth indicates constant growth rate , it is frequently assumed that exponentially growing cells are at a steady-state however , cells can grow exponentially at a constant rate while remodeling their metabolism and gene expression a virus ( for example covid-19 , or smallpox ) typically will spread exponentially at first , if no artificial immunization is available these secondary electrons also are accelerated , creating larger numbers of free electrons the resulting exponential growth of electrons and ions may rapidly lead to complete dielectric breakdown of the material '' due to the exponential rate of increase , at any point in the chain reaction 99 % of the energy will have been released in the last 4.6 generations economic growth is expressed in percentage terms , implying exponential growth compound interest at a constant interest rate provides exponential growth of the capital see also moore 's law and technological singularity ( under exponential growth , there are no singularities growth rates may also be faster than exponential in between exponential and hyperbolic growth lie more classes of growth behavior , like the hyperoperations beginning at tetration , and a ( n , n ) , the diagonal of the ackermann function exponential growth bias is the tendency to underestimate compound growth processes french children are offered a riddle , which shows an aspect of exponential growth : '' the apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit '' growth in a finite world – sustainability and the exponential function — presentation dr

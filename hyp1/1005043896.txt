the phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound the phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well-known inventor thomas edison in 1877 edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day first , the sound enters a cone-shaped component of the device , called the microphone diaphragm in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed because the needle had to continually make contact with the groove in the diaphragm every time the recording was played , the groove would wear down the last problem with the phonograph was related to fidelity fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph as can be expected from such an early audio recording machine , the fidelity of edison 's phonograph was extremely low inventor emile berliner created the device in 1887 , only ten years after edison 's original device the next great advancement in analog sound recording came in the form of the telegraphone , which was created by danish inventor valdemar poulsen between 1898 and 1900 like the recording devices that came before it , the telegraphone recordings were nearly impossible to edit adding a dc bias to the signal sent to the recording head reduced distortion in the recording comparison of analog and digital recording history of sound recording magnetic tape timeline of audio formats

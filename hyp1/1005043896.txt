the phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound the phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well-known inventor thomas edison in 1877 edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day for a sound to be recorded by the phonograph , it has to go through three distinct steps in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed as the cylinder spins , the needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session the biggest of these , and the one that ended up being fixed first , came from the physical contact between the phonograph needle and the tinfoil diaphragm fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph as can be expected from such an early audio recording machine , the fidelity of edison 's phonograph was extremely low the next great advancement in analog sound recording came in the form of the telegraphone , which was created by danish inventor valdemar poulsen between 1898 and 1900 like the recording devices that came before it , the telegraphone recordings were nearly impossible to edit there were many advantages of tape recording , but the most important was that it led to the development of multitracking adding a dc bias to the signal sent to the recording head reduced distortion in the recording comparison of analog and digital recording history of sound recording magnetic tape timeline of audio formats

the phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound the phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well-known inventor thomas edison in 1877 edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day that sound causes the microphone diaphragm , which is connected to a small metal needle , to vibrate in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed as the cylinder spins , the needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session the biggest of these , and the one that ended up being fixed first , came from the physical contact between the phonograph needle and the tinfoil diaphragm fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph as can be expected from such an early audio recording machine , the fidelity of edison 's phonograph was extremely low berliner 's main improvement to the phonograph was related to the component of the device that actually held the recorded information this machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph , in that instead of recording sound mechanically , it recorded using a process called magnetic storage like the recording devices that came before it , the telegraphone recordings were nearly impossible to edit adding a dc bias to the signal sent to the recording head reduced distortion in the recording comparison of analog and digital recording history of sound recording magnetic tape timeline of audio formats

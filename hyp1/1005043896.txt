the phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound the phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well-known inventor thomas edison in 1877 edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed as the cylinder spins , the needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session the biggest of these , and the one that ended up being fixed first , came from the physical contact between the phonograph needle and the tinfoil diaphragm because the needle had to continually make contact with the groove in the diaphragm every time the recording was played , the groove would wear down unlike music today , which can be edited endlessly , the music captured by phonograph machines were single-take , live recordings fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph as can be expected from such an early audio recording machine , the fidelity of edison 's phonograph was extremely low this quality allowed for the mass production of recorded discs , which was the first step towards commercially recorded music this machine was vastly different from the gramophone or the phonograph , in that instead of recording sound mechanically , it recorded using a process called magnetic storage though audiences and inventors had not yet experienced what high fidelity recording would even sound like , they knew that the sound they were hearing from recordings needed to be improved before any kind of recorded music industry could be expected comparison of analog and digital recording history of sound recording magnetic tape timeline of audio formats

the phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound the phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well-known inventor thomas edison in 1877 edison incorporated various elements into his phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day first , the sound enters a cone-shaped component of the device , called the microphone diaphragm in order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed as the cylinder spins , the needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session because the needle had to continually make contact with the groove in the diaphragm every time the recording was played , the groove would wear down the last problem with the phonograph was related to fidelity fidelity is the similarity/difference between the original recorded sound , and that same sound after it has been reproduced by a playback device , in this case the phonograph as can be expected from such an early audio recording machine , the fidelity of edison 's phonograph was extremely low unfortunately , though the gramophone was a large step up from the phonograph commercially , it still had many of the same problems the next great advancement in analog sound recording came in the form of the telegraphone , which was created by danish inventor valdemar poulsen between 1898 and 1900 adding a dc bias to the signal sent to the recording head reduced distortion in the recording comparison of analog and digital recording history of sound recording magnetic tape timeline of audio formats

he was the son of sir thomas fludd , a high-ranking governmental official ( queen elizabeth i 's treasurer for war in europe ) , and member of parliament st john ’ s college , oxford was one of the few in england with any provision for fellowship ( medicine ) ; william huffman suggests that the presence of a medical fellow at st john 's college , oxford influenced fludd 's interest in studying medicine during fludd ’ s time at st john ’ s college , the medical fellow in residence was matthew gwinne ; gwinne had previously produced a tract indicating that , while he practiced galen , he was also familiar with the main paracelsus medical work fludd may have encountered gwinne , or his writing , during his time at oxford , providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice between 1598 and 1604 , fludd studied medicine , chemistry and hermeticism on the european mainland following his graduation furthermore , he indicated that he travelled throughout spain , italy and germany following his time in france upon returning to england in 1604 , fludd matriculated to christ church , oxford he intended to take a degree in medicine the main requirements to obtain this , at the time , included demonstrating that he ( the supplicant ) had read and understood the required medical texts—primarily those by galen and hippocrates fludd defended three theses following these texts , and on 14 may 1605 , fludd made his supplication after graduating from christ church , fludd moved to london , settling in fenchurch street , and making repeated attempts to enter the college of physicians fludd encountered problems with the college examiners , both because of his unconcealed contempt for traditional medical authorities ( he had adopted the views of paracelsus ) , and because of his attitude to authority—especially those of the ancients like galen he became such an established figure within the college that he was included in seventeenth-century critiques of the college , including those by nicholas culpepper and peter coles fludd was one of the first to support in print the theory of the circulation of the blood of the college 's william harvey to what extent fludd may have actually influenced harvey is still debated , in the context that harvey 's discovery is hard to date precisely much of fludd 's writing , and his pathology of disease , centered around the sympathies found in nature between man , the terrestrial earth , and the divine this last element was also called the spirit of the lord , and it made up the passive matter of all other substances , including all secondary elements and the four qualities of the ancients the divine light ( the second of fludd ’ s primary principles ) was the '' active agent '' responsible for creation the sun conveyed spirit to the earth through its rays , which circulated in and about the earth giving it life likewise , the blood of man carried the spirit of the lord ( the same spirit provided by the sun ) , and circulated through the body of man this was an application of the sympathies and parallels provided to all of god ’ s creation by fludd ’ s tripartite theory of matter comparatively , the astral influences on the macrocosmal spirit could be transported to the microcosmal spirit in the blood by the active commerce assumed between the macrocosm and the microcosm fludd extended this interaction to his conception of disease : the movement of spirit between the macrocosm and microcosm could be corrupted and invade the microcosm as disease in succession he defended the rosicrucians against andreas libavius , debated with kepler , argued against french natural philosophers including gassendi , and engaged in the discussion of the weapon-salve fludd was not a member of the rosicrucians , as often alleged , but he defended their thoughts as expressed in numerous manifestos and pamphlets it consists of three books , de vita , de morte , and de resurrectione it is now seriously doubted that any formal organisation identifiable as the '' brothers of the rose cross '' ( rosicrucians ) ever actually existed in any extant form the theological and philosophical claims circulating under this name appear , to these outsiders , to have been more an intellectual fashion that swept europe at the time of the counter reformation between 1607 and 1616 , two anonymous rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group , first in germany and later throughout europe the peak of the rosicrucianism came in 1622 with mysterious posters appearing on the walls of paris , and occult philosophers such as michael maier , robert fludd and thomas vaughan interested themselves in the rosicrucian world view fludd also wrote against the tillage of light ( 1623 ) of patrick scot ;

he was the son of sir thomas fludd , a high-ranking governmental official ( queen elizabeth i 's treasurer for war in europe ) , and member of parliament he entered st john 's college , oxford as a commoner in 1591 , graduating with a b.a st john ’ s college , oxford was one of the few in england with any provision for fellowship ( medicine ) ; william huffman suggests that the presence of a medical fellow at st john 's college , oxford influenced fludd 's interest in studying medicine during fludd ’ s time at st john ’ s college , the medical fellow in residence was matthew gwinne ; gwinne had previously produced a tract indicating that , while he practiced galen , he was also familiar with the main paracelsus medical work fludd may have encountered gwinne , or his writing , during his time at oxford , providing an additional influence for his later medical philosophy and practice upon returning to england in 1604 , fludd matriculated to christ church , oxford the main requirements to obtain this , at the time , included demonstrating that he ( the supplicant ) had read and understood the required medical texts—primarily those by galen and hippocrates fludd defended three theses following these texts , and on 14 may 1605 , fludd made his supplication after graduating from christ church , fludd moved to london , settling in fenchurch street , and making repeated attempts to enter the college of physicians fludd encountered problems with the college examiners , both because of his unconcealed contempt for traditional medical authorities ( he had adopted the views of paracelsus ) , and because of his attitude to authority—especially those of the ancients like galen he became such an established figure within the college that he was included in seventeenth-century critiques of the college , including those by nicholas culpepper and peter coles he was on good terms with sir william paddy fludd was one of the first to support in print the theory of the circulation of the blood of the college 's william harvey to what extent fludd may have actually influenced harvey is still debated , in the context that harvey 's discovery is hard to date precisely this view later brought fludd into conflict with johannes kepler much of fludd 's writing , and his pathology of disease , centered around the sympathies found in nature between man , the terrestrial earth , and the divine while paracelsian in nature , fludd 's own theory on the origin of all things posited that , instead of the tria prima , all species and things stemmed from first , dark chaos , then divine light which acted upon the chaos , which finally brought forth the waters moreover , the fluddean tripartite theory concluded that paracelsus ' own conception of the three primary principles—sulphur , salt and mercury—eventually derived from chaos and light interacting to create variations of the waters , or spirit fludd was heavily reliant on scripture ; in the bible , the number three represented the principium formarum , or the original form the divine light ( the second of fludd ’ s primary principles ) was the '' active agent '' responsible for creation fludd concluded , from a reading of psalm 19:4— '' in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun '' —that the spirit of the lord was contained literally within the sun , placing it central to fludd ’ s model of the macrocosm the blood was central to fludd 's conception of the relationship between the microcosm and macrocosm ; the blood and the spirit it circulated interacted directly with the spirit conveyed to the macrocosm comparatively , the astral influences on the macrocosmal spirit could be transported to the microcosmal spirit in the blood by the active commerce assumed between the macrocosm and the microcosm fludd extended this interaction to his conception of disease : the movement of spirit between the macrocosm and microcosm could be corrupted and invade the microcosm as disease like paracelsus , fludd conceived of disease as an external invader , rather than a complexional imbalance fludd died on 8 september 1637 in london in succession he defended the rosicrucians against andreas libavius , debated with kepler , argued against french natural philosophers including gassendi , and engaged in the discussion of the weapon-salve fludd was not a member of the rosicrucians , as often alleged , but he defended their thoughts as expressed in numerous manifestos and pamphlets between 1607 and 1616 , two anonymous rosicrucian manifestos were published by some anonymous person or group , first in germany and later throughout europe the first manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher heinrich khunrath , of hamburg , author of the amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae ( 1609 ) who himself had borrowed generously from the work of john dee the real history of the rosicrucians , by arthur edward waite , & 91 ; 1887 & 93 ; , it has also been said that what fludd did was to liberate occultism , both from traditional aristotelian philosophy , and from the coming ( cartesian ) philosophy of his time james brown craven , doctor fludd ( robertus de fluctibus ) , the english rosicrucian : life and writings , kirkwall : william peace & son , 1902 guariento , luca ( 2016 ) life , friends , and associations of robert fludd : a revised account robert fludd biography at levity fludd 's magnum opus , 'utriusque cosmi maioris salicet et minoris metaphysica

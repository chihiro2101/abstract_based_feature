the word idea comes from greek ἰδέα idea '' form , pattern , '' from the root of ἰδεῖν idein , '' to see innate and adventitious ideas one view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas ( called innate ideas ) which can be general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our perception but rather were in some sense always present these are distinguished from adventitious ideas which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world , from personal experiences this can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of innate ideas , '' concrete ideas versus abstraction '' , as well as '' simple ideas versus complex ideas '' the encyclopedia of philosophy , macmillan publishing company , new york , 1973 vol 4 : 120–121 plato argued in dialogues such as the phaedo , symposium , republic , and timaeus that there is a realm of ideas or forms ( eidei ) , which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas , and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge , for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties , ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are consequently , plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion ; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas furthermore , ideas for plato appear to serve as universals ; consider the following passage from the republic : descartes often wrote of the meaning of idea as an image or representation , often but not necessarily '' in the mind '' , which was well known in the vernacular despite that descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-platonic use of the term , he at first followed this vernacular use b in his meditations on first philosophy he says , '' some of my thoughts are like images of things , and it is to these alone that the name 'idea ' properly belongs '' he sometimes maintained that ideas were innate vol 4 : 196–198 and uses of the term idea diverge from the original primary scholastic use descartes 's ideas for him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities in striking contrast to plato 's use of idea vol 4 : 487–503 is that of john locke a simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas , and what are the different types of ideas an idea to locke “ can simply mean some sort of brute experience ebscohost , search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx ? direct true & db e862xna & an 344063 & site ehost-live he shows that there are “ no innate principles in the mind ” therefore , an idea was an experience in which the human mind apprehended something hume differs from locke by limiting idea to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions , the perceptual process being described as an '' impression in choosing the means to those ends , they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas '' regulative ideas '' are ideals that one must tend towards , but by definition may not be completely realized wundt widens the term from kant 's usage to include conscious representation of some object or process of the external world in so doing , he includes not only ideas of memory and imagination , but also perceptual processes , whereas other psychologists confine the term to the first two groups '' dictionary of philosophy and psychology they point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways when a man , for example , has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say '' this is a chair , that is a stool '' , he has what is known as an '' abstract idea '' distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair ( see abstraction ) in 1976 , in his book the selfish gene , richard dawkins suggested applying biological evolutionary theories to the spread of ideas a copyright is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work , not an idea but it gives the copyright owner no exclusive rights concerning the idea , method or system involved ross , plato 's theory of ideas ( oxford 1951 ) peter watson , ideas : a history from fire to freud , weidenfeld & nicolson ( london 2005 ) j

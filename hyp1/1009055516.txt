during this time , he published observations about a comet as well as astronomical tables , which gave him a reputation as a good astronomer and mathematician , and the margrave appointed him as his official mathematician by september 1601 , marius had already left prague and he arrived in padua in december 1601 to study medicine at the university of padua in 1606 , marius married felicitas lauer ( born 1590 ) , the daughter of his publisher , in ansbach , and in 1609 he published the first german translations of euclid 's elements capra published another book in 1607 which he actually plagiarised from galileo , and marius was implicated in the act due to his prior association with capra , even though this was after marius had left padua in 1614 , marius published his work mundus iovialis describing the planet jupiter and its moons ( he previously had published the discovery in 1611 in a local almanac ) marius used the julian calendar , and that date is equivalent to january 8 , 1610 , in the gregorian one used by galileo , one day after galileo 's letter in which he first described the moons regardless of priority , the mythological names by which these satellites are known today ( io , europa , ganymede and callisto ) are those given them by marius : marius/schlör , mundus iovialis , p 190–191 that , from his observations of the galilean moons he derived better periods of revolution and other orbital elements for them than did galileo the stellar disks he observed were spurious ( likely the airy disk caused by diffraction , as stars are too distant for their physical disks to be detected telescopically ) , but marius interpreted them to be physical disks , like the planetary disks visible through a telescope he also concluded from his observations of the galilean moons that they must orbit jupiter while jupiter orbits the sun

o lord my god , thou hast been magnified exceedingly on saturday evening , it is the first kathisma ( psalms 1-8 ) '' lord i have cried '' ( psalms 140 ( 141 ) , 141 ( 142 ) , 129 ( 130 ) , and 116 ( 117 ) ) is chanted in the tone of the week the entrance is made with the censer the hymn phos hilaron ( '' o gladsome light '' ) is sung the prayer '' vouchsafe , o lord '' , is read the litany of fervent supplication on major feast days , a litiy will be served at this point the clergy and the cantors will process to the back of the church in front of an icon of the feast or saint being commemorated the priest ends with a long prayer invoking the intercessions of the saints and the theotokos these are verses that teach about the feast day ( or on a saturday evening , christ 's resurrection ) the apolytikia ( troparia of the day ) are chanted if it is an all-night vigil on saturday night , the hymn '' rejoice , o virgin theotokos '' is chanted instead if it is an all-night vigil this is a simple blessing by the priest ;

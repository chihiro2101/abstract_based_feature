following the failure of the spring offensive to end the conflict , erich ludendorff , operations ( military staff ) , believed that an attack through flanders would give germany a decisive victory over the british expeditionary force ( bef ) to shield his intentions and draw allied troops away from belgium , ludendorff planned for a large diversionary attack along the marne between the front and the main line of resistance were two lines of strong points , again mostly on reverse slopes the french gun line behind the front was lightly manned , but the remaining guns fired frequently , so the germans did not detect its weakness from rate of firing , although aerial observers did spot a concentration of field guns behind the main line of resistance german offensive tactics stressed surprise , but french intelligence based on aerial observation gave clear warning and from twenty-seven prisoners taken in a trench raid they learned the hour for the attack when the germans opened fire they pounded the almost empty french front line and their counter-battery fire struck many vacated gun pits the attackers moved easily through the french front and then were led onward by a rolling barrage , which soon was well ahead of the infantry because they were held up by the points of resistance when they encountered the french mainline they were ordered to rest , regroup and wait until their field guns were moved into range the allied preparation was very important in countering the german offensive consequently , the french and american forces led by foch were able to conduct a different attack on exposed parts of the enemy lines , leaving the germans with no choice but to retreat 7 the force that defeated the german offensive was mainly french , with american , british and italian support co-ordinating this counter-attack would be a major problem as foch had to work with '' four national commanders but without any real authority to issue order under his own name , with the tenth field artillery at the second battle of the marne the second battle of the marne , 1918 british 62nd division 's part in the events celebrations of the anniversary of the victory of the battle of the marne at meaux church in 1916 great map of the 2nd battle of the marne , click it to enlarge to full size .

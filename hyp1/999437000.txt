sunni muslims believe that islam requires all decisions made by and for the muslim societies to be made by shura of the muslim community and believe this to be the basis for implementing representative democracy shia muslims say that islam requires submission to existing rulers if they are correctly appointed , so long as they govern according to sharia or islamic law the difference between the two appears more semantic than actualâ€”the latter accept that the rulers must be accounted in all aspects of ruling , to ensure affairs are managed in the best possible way whether decisions were taken through consultation or not shura in the qur'an the first mention of shura in the qur'an comes in the 2nd sura of qur'an 2:233 in the matter of the collective family decision regarding weaning the child from mother 's milk this verse encourages that both parents decide by their mutual consultation about weaning their child online qur'an project chapter 42 the 38th verse of that sura declares shura to be the praiseworthy lifestyle of a successful believer the verse makes a direct reference to those ( muslims ) who disobeyed muhammad , indicating that ordinary , fallible muslims should be consulted it was common among muhammad 's companions to ask him if a certain advice was from god or from him some times muhammad changed his opinion on the advice of his followers like his decision to defend the city of madinah by going out of the city in uhad instead of from within the city shi ' a do not stress the role of shura in choosing leaders , but believe that the divine vice-regent is chosen by god , or allah , from the lineage of muhammad ( ahl al-bayt ) few of the later caliphs had anything but nominal control over the many islamic states , and none were chosen by shura ; all reached power by inheritance the verses indicate that shura is praiseworthy but do not indicate who should be consulted , what they should be consulted about , or whether the ruler or the shura should prevail in the event the two do not agree shuras have also been a feature of revolutions in islamic societies , such as in the iranian revolution of 1979 , where they were formed by workers and held considerable power over parts of the economy for a year before being dismantled process of choosing the leader ( caliph ) of the muslims many contemporary muslims have compared the concept of shura to the principles of western parliamentary democracy taqiuddin al-nabhani , the founder of the modern transnational islamist party hizb ut-tahrir , writes that shura is important and part of '' the ruling structure '' of the islamic caliphate , '' but not one of its pillars in persian language and dari in afghanistan , the term , shuravi is used for 'soviet ' ( the etymology being related to council )

in 1947 asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and , as part of his experimental procedure , he needed to dissolve catechol in water as he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit the water 's surface , it occurred to him that if catechol were any more soluble , then it would dissolve before it encountered the water asimov wrote the article on 8 june 1947 , but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' this second article described the use of thiotimoline to establish a quantitative classification of '' certain mental disorders '' it also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline 's behaviour : namely that the chemical bonds in the compound 's structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' the first article also appeared in fifty years of the best science fiction from analog ( davis publications , 1982 ) instead of a fake scientific paper , this third article took the form of an address by asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the american chronochemical society , a nonexistent scientific society in his address , asimov '' describes '' his first experiments with thiotimoline in july 1947 , and timing the compound 's dissolution with the original endochronometer , '' the same instrument now at the smithsonian '' finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it the article was reprinted in full in opus 100 ( 1969 ) and the asimov chronicles : fifty years of isaac asimov ( 1989 ) asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) asimov included '' thiotimoline to the stars '' in his 1975 collection buy jupiter and other stories '' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive

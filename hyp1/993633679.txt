in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past in 1947 asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and , as part of his experimental procedure , he needed to dissolve catechol in water the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' appeared in the december 1953 issue of astounding the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection the early asimov the first article also appeared in fifty years of the best science fiction from analog ( davis publications , 1982 ) asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 november 1959 called '' thiotimoline and the space age '' instead of a fake scientific paper , this third article took the form of an address by asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the american chronochemical society , a nonexistent scientific society in his address , asimov '' describes '' his first experiments with thiotimoline in july 1947 , and timing the compound 's dissolution with the original endochronometer , '' the same instrument now at the smithsonian '' asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) one effect of endochronicity is that if one fails to add water to an object that has reacted to water , the object will travel into the future in search of water to interact with spider robinson 's story '' mirror mirror , off the wall '' , published in time travelers strictly cash in 1981 , also references thiotimoline '' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive

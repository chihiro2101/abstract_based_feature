in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past by that time asimov had been writing professionally for nine years and would soon write a doctoral dissertation the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' this second article described the use of thiotimoline to establish a quantitative classification of '' certain mental disorders '' it also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline 's behaviour : namely that the chemical bonds in the compound 's structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension according to the second article , thiotimoline 's time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' the first article also appeared in fifty years of the best science fiction from analog ( davis publications , 1982 ) asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 november 1959 called '' thiotimoline and the space age '' '' thiotimoline and the space age '' appeared in the october 1960 issue of astounding , which was then in the final stages of changing its name to analog asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) vernon also emphasizes that endochronic molecules are unstable , and must be renewed before each trip , so that an endochronic ship that finds itself lost might not have sufficient endochronicity to return to its proper time asimov included '' thiotimoline to the stars '' in his 1975 collection buy jupiter and other stories '' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive

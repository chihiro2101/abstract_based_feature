in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past thiotimoline is derived from the bark of the ( fictitious ) shrub rosacea karlsbadensis rugo , and the thiotimoline molecule includes at least fourteen hydroxy groups , two amine groups , and one sulfonic acid group , and possibly one nitro compound group as well his examiners told him that they accepted his dissertation by asking a final question about thiotimoline , resulting in him having to be led from the room while laughing hysterically with relief the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' according to the second article , thiotimoline 's time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection the early asimov the first article also appeared in fifty years of the best science fiction from analog ( davis publications , 1982 ) asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 november 1959 called '' thiotimoline and the space age '' instead of a fake scientific paper , this third article took the form of an address by asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the american chronochemical society , a nonexistent scientific society in every case where the thiotimoline dissolved , some accident occurred that caused some water to be added to it at the proper time asimov speculated that noah 's flood might have been brought about by thiotimoline experiments among the ancient sumerians asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) '' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive

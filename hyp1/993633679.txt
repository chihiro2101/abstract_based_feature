in asimov 's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule , there is at least one carbon atom such that , while two of the carbon 's four chemical bonds lie in normal spacetime , one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past in 1947 asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and , as part of his experimental procedure , he needed to dissolve catechol in water asimov wrote the article on 8 june 1947 , but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable his examiners told him that they accepted his dissertation by asking a final question about thiotimoline , resulting in him having to be led from the room while laughing hysterically with relief the article made asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction , as chemists shared copies of the article in 1952 , asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' this second article described the use of thiotimoline to establish a quantitative classification of '' certain mental disorders '' the first two thiotimoline '' articles '' appeared together in asimov 's first collection of science essays , only a trillion ( 1957 ) , under the joint title '' the marvellous properties of thiotimoline '' asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 november 1959 called '' thiotimoline and the space age '' finally , asimov describes attempts to create a '' heisenberg failure '' , to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it in every case where the thiotimoline dissolved , some accident occurred that caused some water to be added to it at the proper time asimov speculated that noah 's flood might have been brought about by thiotimoline experiments among the ancient sumerians '' thiotimoline and the space age '' appeared in the october 1960 issue of astounding , which was then in the final stages of changing its name to analog asimov 's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled '' thiotimoline to the stars '' , which he wrote for harry harrison 's astounding ( 1973 ) '' the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline '' and '' the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline '' on the internet archive

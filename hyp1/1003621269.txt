paddles and oars are the typical means of propulsion for rafts and come in many sizes and varieties with specific river conditions in mind the basic paddle design for rafting consists of 3 parts : single blade shaft t-grip paddles are typically utilized by rafters in smaller and lower volume rivers where rocks and other hazards can damage larger oars paddles are typically used by guests on commercial trips as well since it is seen as a more engaging way to enjoy the river trip oars are designed for several different rivers with sightly different blade shapes built to handle varying river conditions when a raft utilizes oars it is called '' rowing '' though many people typically incorrectly refer to this as '' oaring '' or '' oar framing '' , however , these terms are incorrect and often suggest inexperience when used in conversation with members of the rafting community oars typically use one of 2 systems to attach to the boat , but in either case , they interface with the boat through a large metallic frame strapped to the boat called an '' oar frame '' the bottom of the pin connects to an oar tower designed to hold the pin in place this system is an older system though it is useful for certain types of river running namely big , dangerous class 5 rivers that require your oars to stay in place as much as possible otherwise known as the international scale of river difficulty , below are the six grades of difficulty in white water rafting ( skill level : basic paddling skill ) class 3 : small waves , maybe a small drop , but no considerable danger ( skill level : exceptional rafting experience ) class 5 : whitewater , large waves , large volume , possibility of large rocks and hazards , possibility of a large drop , requires precise maneuvering ( skill level : full mastery of rafting ) class 6 : class 6 rapids are considered to be so dangerous that they are effectively unnavigable on a reliably safe basis rafters can expect to encounter substantial whitewater , huge waves , huge rocks and hazards , and/or substantial drops that will impart severe impacts beyond the structural capacities and impact ratings of almost all rafting equipment ( skill level : full mastery of rafting , and even then it may not be safe ) costello , ben '' a clear and thorough safety talk is one of the most important elements of any competent , professionally run river trip both do-it-yourself and commercial rafting trips often begin with safety presentations to educate rafting participants about problems that may arise image : rafting tara.jpg thumb right rafting in montenegro like all outdoor activities , rafting must balance its use of nature with the conservation of rivers as a natural resource and habitat multi-day rafting trips by do-it-yourself rafters and commercial rafting companies through the national wild and scenic rivers system have the potential to develop environmental stewardship and general environmental behavior

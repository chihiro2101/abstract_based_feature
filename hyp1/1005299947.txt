the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference the most dramatic watershed came in 1900 , in the wake of the invasion , capture , and pillaging of the national capital by an eight-nation coalition that punished china for the boxer rebellion china and revolution : the first phase , 1900–1913 ( 1968 ) pp the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century liang qichao , a late qing reformist who participated in the hundred days ' reform of 1898 , contended that the boundary between han and man must be erased ( ping man-han zhi jie ) in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule he argued that china should be a nation of the orthodox han chinese and no alien race shall rule over them since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated this marked a shift from the earlier discourse of radical racism and assimilation of the non-han groups to the political autonomy of the five races the rhetorical move , as china historian joseph esherick points out , was based on the practical concerns of both imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the chinese frontiers the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea in the 17th century , with the help of ming chinese rebels , the manchus conquered china proper and set up the qing dynasty the main method by which they accomplished control of the chinese heartland was by portraying themselves as enlightened confucian sages part of whose goal was to preserve and advance chinese civilization over the course of centuries the manchus were gradually assimilated into the chinese culture and eventually many manchus identified themselves as a people of china it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history chinese muslims have played an important role in chinese nationalism hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty he even ordered the chinese flag to be saluted during prayer , and that all imams in ningxia preach chinese nationalism hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan lipman , familiar strangers , p 200 hu songshan also cited a hadith , a saying of the prophet muhammad , which says '' loving the motherland is equivalent to loving the faith '' hu songshan harshly criticized those who were non-patriotic and those who taught anti-nationalist thinking , saying that they were fake muslims ma qixi was a muslim reformer , leader of the xidaotang , and he taught that islam could only be understood by using chinese culture such as confucianism he read classic chinese texts and even took his cue from laozi when he decided to go on hajj to mecca ma fuxiang , a chinese muslim general and kuomintang member , was another chinese nationalist ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china ma fuxiang believed that modern education would help hui chinese build a better society and help china resist foreign imperialism and help build the nation ma fuxiang also published many books , and wrote on confucianism and islam , having studied both the quran and the spring and autumn annals ma fuxiang had served under the chinese muslim general dong fuxiang , and fought against the foreigners during the boxer rebellion it was reported that the muslim troops were going to wipe out the foreigners to return a golden age for china , and the muslims repeatedly attacked foreign churches , railways , and legations , before hostilities even started ma fuxiang led an ambush against the foreigners at langfang and inflicted many casualties , using a train to escape dong fuxiang was a xenophobe and hated foreigners , wanting to drive them out of china various muslim organizations in china like china islamic association ( zhongguo huijiao gonghui ) and the chinese muslim association were sponsored by the kuomintang chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home one imam , wang jingzhai , who studied at mecca , translated a hadith , or saying of muhammad , '' aiguo aijiao '' - loving the country is equivalent to loving the faith general bai preached chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism while opponents have argued that reactionary nationalism is inherently unnecessary for a powerful nation , chinese nationalists assert that chinese nationalism was in many ways a result of western imperialism and is fundamental to the founding and stability of a modern chinese state edward friedman has argued that there is a northern governmental , political , bureaucratic chinese nationalism that is at odds with a southern , commercial chinese nationalism as xi

there have been versions of a chinese state for around 4,000 years the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference anyone who wanted to rise in government non-military service had to be immersed in confucian classics , and pass a very difficult test jensen , manufacturing confucianism : chinese traditions & universal civilization ( duke up , 1997 ) pp the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule he argued that china should be a nation of the orthodox han chinese and no alien race shall rule over them according to zou , the han chinese , as the descendants of the yellow emperor , must overthrow the manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights wang contended that a state consisting of a single race would be superior to those multiracial ones most of the republican revolutionaries agreed that preserving the race was vital to the survival of the nation since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated '' after the 1911 revolution , sun yat-sen established the republic of china , the national flag of which contained five colors with each symbolizing a major racial ethnicity of china in addition to anti-manchurism and anti-imperialism , political scientist chalmers johnson has argued that the rise of power of the ccp through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as '' a species of nationalism in the context of social mobilization , chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the second sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , when the ccp mobilized the peasantry to fight against the japanese invaders johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea defining the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout chinese history the main method by which they accomplished control of the chinese heartland was by portraying themselves as enlightened confucian sages part of whose goal was to preserve and advance chinese civilization it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history chinese muslims and uighurs chinese muslims have played an important role in chinese nationalism chinese muslims , known as hui people , are a mixture of the descendants of foreign muslims like arabs and persians , mixed with han chinese who converted to islam he even ordered the chinese flag to be saluted during prayer , and that all imams in ningxia preach chinese nationalism hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan lipman , familiar strangers , p 200 hu songshan also cited a hadith , a saying of the prophet muhammad , which says '' loving the motherland is equivalent to loving the faith '' ma fuxiang , a chinese muslim general and kuomintang member , was another chinese nationalist ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china ma fuxiang believed that modern education would help hui chinese build a better society and help china resist foreign imperialism and help build the nation the muslim troops were armed with modern repeater rifles and artillery , and reportedly enthusiastic about going on the offensive and killing foreigners chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home one imam , wang jingzhai , who studied at mecca , translated a hadith , or saying of muhammad , '' aiguo aijiao '' - loving the country is equivalent to loving the faith general bai preached chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism translations from egyptian writings and the quran were used to support propaganda in favour of a jihad against japan ma bufang , a chinese muslim general who was part of the kuomintang , supported chinese nationalism and tolerance between the different chinese ethnic groups ma bufang presented himself as a chinese nationalist who fought against western imperialism to the people of china in order to deflect criticism by opponents that his government was feudal and oppressed minorities like tibetans and buddhist mongols in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism another example of modern nationalism in china is the hanfu movement , which is a chinese movement in the early 21st century that seeks the revival of ancient chinese clothing chinese nationalism ( m , e '' available at issuu harvard asia pacific review 11.1

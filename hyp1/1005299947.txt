the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state commenter lucian pye has argued that the modern '' nation state '' is fundamentally different from a traditional empire , and argues that dynamics of the current people 's republic of china ( prc ) – a concentration of power at a central point of authority – share an essential similarity with the ming and qing empires chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference the most dramatic watershed came in 1900 , in the wake of the invasion , capture , and pillaging of the national capital by an eight-nation coalition that punished china for the boxer rebellion most citizens had multiple identities , of which the locality was more important than the nation as a whole the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century he thus proposes to supplement the chinese communist ideology in the discussion of chinese nationalism , which he labels '' peasant nationalism after qing 's defeat in the first sino-japanese war , reformers and intellectuals debated how to strengthen the nation , the discussion of which centered on the issue of race liang qichao , a late qing reformist who participated in the hundred days ' reform of 1898 , contended that the boundary between han and man must be erased ( ping man-han zhi jie ) liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule he argued that china should be a nation of the orthodox han chinese and no alien race shall rule over them according to zou , the han chinese , as the descendants of the yellow emperor , must overthrow the manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race the rhetorical move , as china historian joseph esherick points out , was based on the practical concerns of both imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the chinese frontiers while both japan and russia were encroaching china , the newly born republic also faced ethnic movements in mongolia and tibet which claimed themselves to be part of the qing empire rather than the republic of china with the increasing threat from the imperialist powers in the 1910s , anti-imperialist sentiments started to grow and spread in china in the context of social mobilization , chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the second sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , when the ccp mobilized the peasantry to fight against the japanese invaders on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea the manchus were faced with the issue of maintaining loyalty among the people they ruled while at the same time maintaining a distinctive identity the main method by which they accomplished control of the chinese heartland was by portraying themselves as enlightened confucian sages part of whose goal was to preserve and advance chinese civilization it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history in 1909 , the law of nationality of great qing was published by the manchu government , which defined chinese with the following rules : 1 ) born in china while his/her father is a chinese ; 2 ) born after his/her father 's death while his/her father is a chinese at his death ; 3 ) his/her mother is a chinese while his/her father 's nationality is unclear or stateless in 1919 , the may fourth movement grew out of student protests to the treaty of versailles , especially its terms allowing japan to shandong problem surrendered by germany after the siege of tsingtao , and spurned upsurges of chinese nationalism amongst the protests the official chinese nationalistic view in the 1920s and 1930s was heavily influenced by modernism and social darwinism , and included advocacy of the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups in the western and central provinces into the '' culturally advanced '' han state , to become in name as well as in fact members of the chinese nation hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty he even ordered the chinese flag to be saluted during prayer , and that all imams in ningxia preach chinese nationalism hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan ma fuxiang , a chinese muslim general and kuomintang member , was another chinese nationalist 169 the muslim unit he served in was noted for being anti-foreign , being involved in shooting a westerner and a japanese to death before the boxer rebellion broke out various muslim organizations in china like china islamic association ( zhongguo huijiao gonghui ) and the chinese muslim association were sponsored by the kuomintang one imam , wang jingzhai , who studied at mecca , translated a hadith , or saying of muhammad , '' aiguo aijiao '' - loving the country is equivalent to loving the faith general bai chongxi , the warlord of guangxi , and a member of the kuomintang , presented himself as the protector of islam in china and harbored muslim intellectuals fleeing from the japanese invasion in guangxi translations from egyptian writings and the quran were used to support propaganda in favour of a jihad against japan in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism uighur street names and signs were changed to chinese , and the chinese muslim troops imported chinese cooks and baths , rather than using uighur ones the 36th division had crushed the turkish islamic republic of east turkestan , and the chinese muslim general ma zhancang beheaded the uighur emirs abdullah bughra and nur ahmad jan bughra the 9th panchen lama , thubten choekyi nyima , was considered extremely '' pro-chinese '' , according to official chinese sources one unified common goal of current chinese nationalists is the unification of mainland china and taiwan in taiwan , there is currently a general consensus to support the status quo of taiwan 's political status despite this , the relationship between chinese nationalism and taiwan remains controversial , involving symbolic issues such as the use of '' the republic of china '' as the official name of the government on taiwan and the use of the word '' china '' in the name of government-owned corporations ( e.g the argument against unification is partly over culture and whether the taiwanese people should see themselves as chinese or taiwanese ; and partly over mistrust of the ruling chinese communist party ( ccp ) , such as its de-democratizing actions in hong kong ( e.g chinese nationalism has had mutable relationships with chinese living outside of mainland china and taiwan some critics states that chinese nationalism is '' inherently backward '' such as nationalism in every country and is therefore incompatible with a modern state in extreme cases , some chinese have questioned whether or not chinese companies are actually chinese '' peter ferdinand , '' westward hothe china dream and

there have been versions of a chinese state for around 4,000 years the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen chinese nationalism was rooted in the long historic tradition of china as the center of the world , in which all other states were offshoots and owed some sort of deference it was a matter of humiliation one after another , the loss of faith in the manchu dynasty the most dramatic watershed came in 1900 , in the wake of the invasion , capture , and pillaging of the national capital by an eight-nation coalition that punished china for the boxer rebellion china and revolution : the first phase , 1900â€“1913 ( 1968 ) pp ethnic nationalism was , in any case , unacceptable to the ruling manchu elitethey were foreigners who conquered china and maintained their own language and traditions anyone who wanted to rise in government non-military service had to be immersed in confucian classics , and pass a very difficult test jensen , manufacturing confucianism : chinese traditions & universal civilization ( duke up , 1997 ) pp the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 the origin of modern chinese nationalism can be traced back to the intellectual debate on race and nation in late nineteenth century while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century after qing 's defeat in the first sino-japanese war , reformers and intellectuals debated how to strengthen the nation , the discussion of which centered on the issue of race liang qichao , a late qing reformist who participated in the hundred days ' reform of 1898 , contended that the boundary between han and man must be erased ( ping man-han zhi jie ) liang 's thought was based on the idea of racial competition , a concept originating from social darwinism that believed only superior races would survive whereas the inferior races were bound to extinct liang 's critique of the qing court and the man-han relations laid the foundation for anti-manchuism , an ideology that early republican revolutionaries advocated in their efforts to overthrow the qing dynasty and found a new republic wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race the rhetorical move , as china historian joseph esherick points out , was based on the practical concerns of both imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the chinese frontiers an ideal of '' a morally just universe , '' anti-imperialism made racism appear shameful and thus took over its dominant role in the conceptualization of chinese nationalism in addition to anti-manchurism and anti-imperialism , political scientist chalmers johnson has argued that the rise of power of the ccp through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as '' a species of nationalism '' johnson observes that social mobilization , a force that unites people to form a political community together , is the '' primary tool '' for conceptualizing nationalism johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation during the 1960s and 1970s , chinese nationalism within mainland china became mixed with the rhetoric of marxism , and nationalistic rhetoric become in large part subsumed into internationalist rhetoric in the 1990s , rising economic standards , the dissolution of soviet union , and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland china in the 17th century , with the help of ming chinese rebels , the manchus conquered china proper and set up the qing dynasty the manchus were faced with the issue of maintaining loyalty among the people they ruled while at the same time maintaining a distinctive identity over the course of centuries the manchus were gradually assimilated into the chinese culture and eventually many manchus identified themselves as a people of china chinese muslims , known as hui people , are a mixture of the descendants of foreign muslims like arabs and persians , mixed with han chinese who converted to islam chinese muslims are sinophones , speaking chinese and practicing confucianism hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan ma fuxiang , a chinese muslim general and kuomintang member , was another chinese nationalist ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china 167 ma fuxiang was loyal to the chinese government , and crushed muslim rebels when ordered to ma fuxiang believed that modern education would help hui chinese build a better society and help china resist foreign imperialism and help build the nation he was praised for his '' guojia yizhi '' ( national consciousness ) by non-muslims ma fuxiang also published many books , and wrote on confucianism and islam , having studied both the quran and the spring and autumn annals ma fuxiang had served under the chinese muslim general dong fuxiang , and fought against the foreigners during the boxer rebellion it was reported that the muslim troops were going to wipe out the foreigners to return a golden age for china , and the muslims repeatedly attacked foreign churches , railways , and legations , before hostilities even started the muslim troops were armed with modern repeater rifles and artillery , and reportedly enthusiastic about going on the offensive and killing foreigners chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home one imam , wang jingzhai , who studied at mecca , translated a hadith , or saying of muhammad , '' aiguo aijiao '' - loving the country is equivalent to loving the faith in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism one unified common goal of current chinese nationalists is the unification of mainland china and taiwan with opening of china under deng xiaoping and the death of mao zedong , the prc 's attitude toward overseas chinese became much more favourable , and overseas chinese were seen as a source of capital and expertise '' textbooks for chinese schools are also distributed by the government of the people 's republic of china in addition to the taiwan independence movement , hong kong independence and japanese nationalism , there are a number of ideologies which exist in opposition or are hostile to chinese

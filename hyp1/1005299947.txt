the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state commenter lucian pye has argued that the modern '' nation state '' is fundamentally different from a traditional empire , and argues that dynamics of the current people 's republic of china ( prc ) – a concentration of power at a central point of authority – share an essential similarity with the ming and qing empires chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen the key factor in european nationalism was tradition – some of the newly manufactured – of a cultural identity based primarily on language and ethnicity the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century after qing 's defeat in the first sino-japanese war , reformers and intellectuals debated how to strengthen the nation , the discussion of which centered on the issue of race liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers liang 's critique of the qing court and the man-han relations laid the foundation for anti-manchuism , an ideology that early republican revolutionaries advocated in their efforts to overthrow the qing dynasty and found a new republic in his writing “ revolutionary army , ” zou rong , an active chinese revolutionary at the turn of the twentieth century , demanded a revolution education for the han people who were suffering from the oppression of the manchu rule according to zou , the han chinese , as the descendants of the yellow emperor , must overthrow the manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race since the han had asserted its dominant role in chinese nationalism , the manchus had to be either absorbed or eradicated '' after the 1911 revolution , sun yat-sen established the republic of china , the national flag of which contained five colors with each symbolizing a major racial ethnicity of china an ideal of '' a morally just universe , '' anti-imperialism made racism appear shameful and thus took over its dominant role in the conceptualization of chinese nationalism in addition to anti-manchurism and anti-imperialism , political scientist chalmers johnson has argued that the rise of power of the ccp through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as '' a species of nationalism '' johnson observes that social mobilization , a force that unites people to form a political community together , is the '' primary tool '' for conceptualizing nationalism johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea defining the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity has been a very complex issue throughout chinese history over the course of centuries the manchus were gradually assimilated into the chinese culture and eventually many manchus identified themselves as a people of china the complexity of the relationship between ethnicity and the chinese identity is best exemplified during the taiping rebellion in which the rebels fought fiercely against the manchus on the ground that they were barbarian foreigners while at the same time others fought just as fiercely on behalf of the manchus on the grounds that they were the preservers of traditional chinese values it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history in 1909 , the law of nationality of great qing was published by the manchu government , which defined chinese with the following rules : 1 ) born in china while his/her father is a chinese ; 2 ) born after his/her father 's death while his/her father is a chinese at his death ; 3 ) his/her mother is a chinese while his/her father 's nationality is unclear or stateless in 1919 , the may fourth movement grew out of student protests to the treaty of versailles , especially its terms allowing japan to shandong problem surrendered by germany after the siege of tsingtao , and spurned upsurges of chinese nationalism amongst the protests the official chinese nationalistic view in the 1920s and 1930s was heavily influenced by modernism and social darwinism , and included advocacy of the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups in the western and central provinces into the '' culturally advanced '' han state , to become in name as well as in fact members of the chinese nation however , many critics argue that despite this official view , assimilationist attitudes remain deeply entrenched , and popular views and actual power relationships create a situation in which chinese nationalism has in practice meant han dominance of minority areas and peoples and assimilation of those groups hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty he even ordered the chinese flag to be saluted during prayer , and that all imams in ningxia preach chinese nationalism hu songshan led the ikhwan , the chinese muslim brotherhood , which became a chinese nationalist , patriotic organization , stressing education and independence of the individual ma fuxiang preached unity of all chinese people , and even non-han chinese people such as tibetans and mongols to stay in china the muslim troops were armed with modern repeater rifles and artillery , and reportedly enthusiastic about going on the offensive and killing foreigners ma fuxiang led an ambush against the foreigners at langfang and inflicted many casualties , using a train to escape chinese muslim students returning from study abroad , from places such as al-azhar university in egypt , learned about nationalism and advocated chinese nationalism at home in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism the chinese muslims even forced the uighur carpet industry at khotan to change its design to chinese versions the tungans ( chinese muslims , hui people ) had anti-japanese sentiment the uighurs had been promoting islamism in their separatist government , but ma hushan eliminated religion from politics the 9th panchen lama , thubten choekyi nyima , was considered extremely '' pro-chinese '' , according to official chinese sources the argument against unification is partly over culture and whether the taiwanese people should see themselves as chinese or taiwanese ; and partly over mistrust of the ruling chinese communist party ( ccp ) , such as its de-democratizing actions in hong kong ( e.g chinese nationalism has had mutable relationships with chinese living outside of mainland china and taiwan as a result , ethnic chinese in regional countries such as malaysia , singapore and thailand , as well as in the western world such as australia , canada and the united states were sharply divided over the concept of ethnic chinese from the concept of '' political chinese '' during the 1960s , the people 's republic of china ( prc ) and republic of china ( roc ) maintained different attitudes toward overseas chinese initially , the prc government viewed overseas chinese as capitalist agents ; in addition , the prc government also thought that maintaining good relations with southeast asian governments was more important than maintaining the support of overseas chinese in the 1990s , the prc 's efforts toward overseas chinese became mostly focused on maintaining the loyalty of '' chinese emigration '' , which consisted of mostly graduate students having moved , either temporarily or permanently in recent years , there have been summer camps which have been set up by organizations such as the china institute and confucius institute in which overseas chinese youths may attend to learn first-hand about its own ancestral chinese culture as well as the language reconfiguring chinese nationalism : how the qing frontier and its indigenes became chinese ( palgrave macmillan , 2007 ) china inside out : contemporary chinese

there have been versions of a chinese state for around 4,000 years the chinese concept of the world was largely a division between the civilized world and the barbarian world and there was little concept of the belief that chinese interests were served by a powerful chinese state chinese nationalism as it emerged in the early 20th century was based on the experience of european nationalism , especially as viewed and interpreted by sun yat-sen ethnic nationalism was , in any case , unacceptable to the ruling manchu elitethey were foreigners who conquered china and maintained their own language and traditions most citizens had multiple identities , of which the locality was more important than the nation as a whole the discussion of modern chinese nationalism has dominated many political and intellectual debates since the late nineteenth century political scientist suisheng zhao argues that nationalism in china is not monolithic but exists in various forms , including political , liberal , ethnical , and state nationalism over the first half of the twentieth century , chinese nationalism has constituted a crucial part of many political ideologies , including the anti-manchuism during 1911 revolution , the anti-imperialism sentiment of the may fourth movement in 1919 , and the maoist thoughts that guided the communist revolution in 1949 shaped by the global discourse of social darwinism , reformers and intellectuals debated how to build a new chinese national subject based on a proper racial order , particularly the man-han relations after the collapse of the qing regime and the founding of the republic of china in 1911 , concerns of both domestic and international threat made the role of racism decline , while anti-imperialism became the new dominant ideology of chinese nationalism over the 1910s while intellectuals and elites advocated their distinctive thoughts on chinese nationalism , political scientist chalmers johnson has pointed out that most of these ideas had very little to do with china 's majority population -- the chinese peasantry '' chinese nationalism in the early twentieth century was primarily based on anti-manchurism , an ideology that was prevalent among chinese revolutionaries from late nineteenth century to the turn of the twentieth century after qing 's defeat in the first sino-japanese war , reformers and intellectuals debated how to strengthen the nation , the discussion of which centered on the issue of race liang attributed the decline of china to the manchu ( qing ) rulers , who treated the han as an '' alien race '' and imposed a racial hierarchy between the han and the manchus while ignoring the threat of imperial powers he argued that china should be a nation of the orthodox han chinese and no alien race shall rule over them according to zou , the han chinese , as the descendants of the yellow emperor , must overthrow the manchu rule to restore their legitimacy and rights wang jingwei , a chinese revolutionary who later became an important figure in the kuomintang , also believed that the manchus were an inferior race historian prasenjit duara summarized this by stating that the republican revolutionaries primarily drew on the international discourse of '' racist evolutionism '' to envision a '' racially purified china '' after the 1911 revolution , sun yat-sen established the republic of china , the national flag of which contained five colors with each symbolizing a major racial ethnicity of china the rhetorical move , as china historian joseph esherick points out , was based on the practical concerns of both imperial threats from the international environment and conflicts on the chinese frontiers while both japan and russia were encroaching china , the newly born republic also faced ethnic movements in mongolia and tibet which claimed themselves to be part of the qing empire rather than the republic of china pressured by both domestic and international problems , the fragile republican regime decided to maintain the borders of the qing empire to keep its territories intact in addition to anti-manchurism and anti-imperialism , political scientist chalmers johnson has argued that the rise of power of the ccp through its alliance with the peasantry should also be understood as '' a species of nationalism '' johnson observes that social mobilization , a force that unites people to form a political community together , is the '' primary tool '' for conceptualizing nationalism in the context of social mobilization , chinese nationalism only fully emerged during the second sino-japanese war ( 1937-1945 ) , when the ccp mobilized the peasantry to fight against the japanese invaders johnson contends that early nationalism of the kuomintang was quite similar to the late nineteenth-century nationalism in europe , as both referred to the search for their national identities and positions in the modern world by the intelligentsia the wartime alliance of the chinese peasantry and the ccp manifests how the nationalist ideology of the ccp , or the peasant nationalism , reinforced the desire of the chinese to save and build a strong nation on the other hand , chinese nationalism in taiwan was primarily about preserving the ideals and lineage of sun yat-sen , the party he founded , the kuomintang ( kmt ) , and anti-communism while the definition of chinese nationalism differed in the republic of china ( roc ) and the people 's republic of china ( prc ) , both are adamant in claiming chinese territories such as the senkaku islands and the nine-dash line in the south china sea in the 1990s , rising economic standards , the dissolution of soviet union , and the lack of any other legitimizing ideology has led to what most observers see as a resurgence of nationalism within mainland china the manchus were faced with the issue of maintaining loyalty among the people they ruled while at the same time maintaining a distinctive identity over the course of centuries the manchus were gradually assimilated into the chinese culture and eventually many manchus identified themselves as a people of china it was during this time that the concept of han chinese came into existence as a means of describing the majority of chinese ethnicity due to sinicization in early chinese history over the next decades , chinese nationalism was influenced strongly by russian ethnographic thinking , and the official ideology of the prc asserts that china is a multi-ethnic state , and han chinese , despite being the overwhelming majority ( over 95 % in the mainland ) , they are only one of many ethnic groups of china , each of whose culture and language should be respected chinese muslims and uighurs hu songshan , a muslim imam from ningxia , was a chinese nationalist and preached chinese nationalism and unity of all chinese people , and also against foreign imperialism and other threats to china 's sovereignty hu songshan led the ikhwan , the chinese muslim brotherhood , which became a chinese nationalist , patriotic organization , stressing education and independence of the individual hu songhan also wrote a prayer in arabic and chinese , praying for allah to support the chinese kuomintang government and defeat japan ma fuxiang , a chinese muslim general and kuomintang member , was another chinese nationalist ma fuxiang had served under the chinese muslim general dong fuxiang , and fought against the foreigners during the boxer rebellion the muslim troops were armed with modern repeater rifles and artillery , and reportedly enthusiastic about going on the offensive and killing foreigners they asserted that there was no contradiction between confucianism and islam , and no contradiction between being a chinese national and a muslim general bai chongxi , the warlord of guangxi , and a member of the kuomintang , presented himself as the protector of islam in china and harbored muslim intellectuals fleeing from the japanese invasion in guangxi ma bufang , a chinese muslim general who was part of the kuomintang , supported chinese nationalism and tolerance between the different chinese ethnic groups in xinjiang , the chinese muslim general ma hushan supported chinese nationalism uighur street names and signs were changed to chinese , and the chinese muslim troops imported chinese cooks and baths , rather than using uighur ones ma hushan proclaimed his loyalty to nanjing , denounced sheng shicai as a soviet puppet , and fought against soviet invasion in 1937 the 36th division had crushed the turkish islamic republic of east turkestan , and the chinese muslim general ma zhancang beheaded the uighur emirs abdullah bughra and nur ahmad jan bughra the uighurs had been promoting islamism in their separatist government , but ma hushan eliminated religion from politics sun yat sen , leader of the kuomintang ( kuomintang ) , known as the father of modern china ( in both the republic of china ( taiwan ) and the people 's republic of china ) , was a southern chinese with cantonese-hakka ancestry because the 2008 summer olympics were a

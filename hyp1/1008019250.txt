historians regard the events as having taken place during the early regal period , but the question of whether the events should be directly associated with tullus is debatable the first event is the destruction of alba longa the battle for alba longa was settled by having two rare set of triplets that were born both to the cities of alba longa and rome battle in mortal combat for the honor of their city however his account does say that the majority believed that the horatii belonged to rome , and the curiatii , alba longa after battling a long time , the last roman brother emerged as victor , thus rome and tullus hostilius won the battle for alba longa tullus ordered alba longa to be destroyed and forced the migration of the alban citizenry to rome , where they were integrated and became roman citizens for the betrayal of rome , tullus had mettius fufetius tied between two chariots and had the horses behinds smacked ; the horses ripped mettius fufetius into two pieces it would also explain things which are otherwise puzzling : tullus 's name being attached to the building , and how , as roman traditions attest , tullus could have led rome 's successful wars against the fidenae and veii and the sabines as with those of all the early kings of rome , the events ascribed to the reign of tullus hostilius are treated with scepticism by modern historians hostilius was probably a historical figure , however , in the strict sense that a man bearing the name tullus hostilius likely reigned as king in rome

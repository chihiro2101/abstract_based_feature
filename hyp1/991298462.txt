one-third of the global land area is covered by dust-producing surfaces , made up of desert like the sahara which covers 0.9 billion hectares , and drylands which occupy 5.2 billion hectares dust in the atmosphere is produced by saltation and sandblasting of sand-sized grains , and it is transported through the troposphere this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts as a multi-factor phenomenon , there is not yet a clear consensus on the sources or potential solutions to the problem recently , initiatives such as project-dust have been established to directly study dust in the middle east dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites road dust is a significant source contributing to the generation and release of particulate into the atmosphere us federal laws require dust control on sources such as vacant lots , unpaved parking lots , and unpaved roads dust control is the suppression of solid particles with diameters less than 500 micrometers the zodiacal light , as seen in a dark night sky , is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the sun dust samples returned from outer space may provide information about conditions in the early solar system image : spring bloom and dust off argentina.jpg a pale brown plume of dust sweeps out of argentina â€™ s pampas dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells , but they do not live on living people

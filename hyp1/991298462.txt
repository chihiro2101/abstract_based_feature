atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites control of road dust is a significant challenge in urban areas , and also in other locations with high levels of vehicular traffic upon unsealed roads , such as mines and landfill dumps road dust may be suppressed by mechanical methods like street sweeper vehicles equipped with vacuum cleaners , vegetable oil sprays , or with water sprayers the danger of coal dust resulted in environmental legislation regulating work place air quality in some jurisdictions most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation united states federal law requires that construction sites obtain permits to conduct earth moving , clearing of areas , to include plans to control dust emissions when the work is being carried out dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet dust in this regime has a complicated emission spectrum , and includes both thermal dust emission and spinning dust emission image : dust over southeast australia.jpg dry , windy weather sends clouds of dust across south-eastern australia dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells , but they do not live on living people house dust mites did not become a problem until humans began to use textiles , such as western style blankets and clothing

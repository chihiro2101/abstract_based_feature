atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces dust in the atmosphere is produced by saltation and sandblasting of sand-sized grains , and it is transported through the troposphere this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods , including paving or laying down gravel , or stabilizing the surface with water , vegetable oils or other dust abatement , or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne dust control is the suppression of solid particles with diameters less than 500 micrometers care is required when removing dust to avoid causing the dust to become airborne cosmic dust is widely present in space , where gas and dust clouds are the primary precursors for planetary systems dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet image : dust over southeast australia.jpg dry , windy weather sends clouds of dust across south-eastern australia image : dust extends from saudi arabia to iran.jpg a thick dust plume over kuwait and the north-western tip of the persian gulf dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells , but they do not live on living people

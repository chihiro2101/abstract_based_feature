atmospheric or wind-borne fugitive dust , also known as aeolian dust , comes from arid and dry regions where high velocity winds are able to remove mostly silt-sized material , deflating susceptible surfaces this airborne dust is considered an aerosol and once in the atmosphere , it can produce strong local radiative forcing saharan dust in particular can be transported and deposited as far as the caribbean and the amazon basin , and may affect air temperatures , cause ocean cooling , and alter rainfall amounts dust kicked up by vehicles traveling on roads may make up 33 % of air pollution road dust consists of deposits of exhaust gas , particles from tire and brake dust , dust from paved roads or potholes , and dust from construction sites road dust may be suppressed by mechanical methods like street sweeper vehicles equipped with vacuum cleaners , vegetable oil sprays , or with water sprayers in addition , if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area , in very rare circumstances , it can create an explosion hazard under certain circumstances most governmental epas , including the united states environmental protection agency ( epa ) mandate that facilities that generate fugitive dust , minimize or mitigate the production of dust in their operation control measures include such simple practices as spraying construction and demolition sites with water , and preventing the tracking of dust onto adjacent roads some of the issues include : reducing dust related health risks that include allergic reactions , pneumonia and asthmatic attacks dust in such places may be suppressed by mechanical methods , including paving or laying down gravel , or stabilizing the surface with water , vegetable oils or other dust abatement , or by using water misters to suppress dust that is already airborne dust poses a health threat to children , '' dust mites in the humid atmosphere of bangalore trigger around 60 % of asthma '' older people , and those with respiratory illnesses cosmic dust is widely present in space , where gas and dust clouds are the primary precursors for planetary systems dust also covers solid planetary bodies , and vast dust storms can occur on mars which cover almost the entire planet dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells , but they do not live on living people

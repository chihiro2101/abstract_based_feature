the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' after lengthy discussion with thomas hobbes , the parisian abraham bosse created the etching for the book 's famous frontispiece in the géometrique style which bosse himself had refined ) the torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons , in the style of giuseppe arcimboldo ; all are facing away from the viewer , with just the giant 's head having visible facial features ( a manuscript of leviathan created for charles ii in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces , all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right each side element reflects the equivalent power – castle to church , crown to mitre , cannon to excommunication , weapons to logic , and the battlefield to the religious courts the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state consequently , any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them however , hobbes states that there is a summum malum , or greatest evil given human nature , the variability of human desires , and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires , the state of nature , as hobbes calls this anarchic condition , must be a war of all against all even when two men are not fighting , there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour , and so they must constantly be on guard against one another the desire to avoid the state of nature , as the place where the summum malum of violent death is most likely to occur , forms the polestar of political reasoning it suggests a number of natural law , although hobbes is quick to point out that they can not properly speaking be called '' laws , '' since there is no one to enforce them hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from social contract , the sovereign can not possibly breach the covenant ; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign : hence the sovereign can not injure any of his subjects and can not be accused of injustice hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of separation of powers in leviathan , hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so , he invites discord hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable hobbes rejected the idea of incorporeal substances and subsequently argued that even god himself was a corporeal substance hobbes also touched upon the sovereign 's ability to tax in leviathan , although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories in part iii hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a christian commonwealth if any person may claim supernatural revelation superior to the civil law , then there would be chaos , and hobbes ' fervent desire is to avoid this hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken '' from aristotle 's civil philosophy , they have learned to call all manner of commonwealths but the popular ( such as was at that time the state of athens ) , tyranny '' the english and latin texts , oxford university press , 2012 ( clarendon edition of the works of thomas hobbes ) the divine politics of thomas hobbes – an interpretation of leviathan , oxford : clarendon press , 1964 the leviathan in the state theory of thomas hobbes – meaning and failure of a political symbol , chicago : the university of chicago press , 2008 ( earlier : greenwood press , 1996 )

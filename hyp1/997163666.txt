the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death after lengthy discussion with thomas hobbes , the parisian abraham bosse created the etching for the book 's famous frontispiece in the géometrique style which bosse himself had refined ) the torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons , in the style of giuseppe arcimboldo ; all are facing away from the viewer , with just the giant 's head having visible facial features ( a manuscript of leviathan created for charles ii in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces , all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state hobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature he suggests that the dominant political theology of the time , scholasticism , thrives on confused definitions of everyday words , such as incorporeal substance , which for hobbes is a contradiction in terms hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the summum bonum , or greatest good , as previous thought had done given human nature , the variability of human desires , and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires , the state of nature , as hobbes calls this anarchic condition , must be a war of all against all the desire to avoid the state of nature , as the place where the summum malum of violent death is most likely to occur , forms the polestar of political reasoning it suggests a number of natural law , although hobbes is quick to point out that they can not properly speaking be called '' laws , '' since there is no one to enforce them hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things hobbes concludes part one by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from social contract , the sovereign can not possibly breach the covenant ; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign the sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule ; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign 's actions every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign : hence the sovereign can not injure any of his subjects and can not be accused of injustice in leviathan , hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so , he invites discord hobbes also touched upon the sovereign 's ability to tax in leviathan , although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories and therefore '' the question truly stated is : by what authority they are made law ? '' unsurprisingly , hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power : he discusses the ten commandments , and asks '' who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the kingdom of god can be found in the church , thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign the english and latin texts , oxford university press , 2012 ( clarendon edition of the works of thomas hobbes ) the divine politics of thomas hobbes – an interpretation of leviathan , oxford : clarendon press , 1964 the leviathan in the state theory of thomas hobbes – meaning and failure of a political symbol , chicago : the university of chicago press , 2008 ( earlier : greenwood press , 1996 ) hobbes and the law of nature , princeton : princeton university press , 2009

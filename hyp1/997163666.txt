the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' after lengthy discussion with thomas hobbes , the parisian abraham bosse created the etching for the book 's famous frontispiece in the géometrique style which bosse himself had refined it is similar in organisation to the frontispiece of hobbes ' de cive ( 1642 ) , created by jean matheus ) the torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons , in the style of giuseppe arcimboldo ; all are facing away from the viewer , with just the giant 's head having visible facial features ( a manuscript of leviathan created for charles ii in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces , all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state he presents an image of man as matter in motion , attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically , that is , without recourse to an incorporeal , immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the human mind he suggests that the dominant political theology of the time , scholasticism , thrives on confused definitions of everyday words , such as incorporeal substance , which for hobbes is a contradiction in terms hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the summum bonum , or greatest good , as previous thought had done not only is the concept of a summum bonum superfluous , but given the variability of human desires , there could be no such thing consequently , any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them since there is no summum bonum , the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good given human nature , the variability of human desires , and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires , the state of nature , as hobbes calls this anarchic condition , must be a war of all against all even when two men are not fighting , there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour , and so they must constantly be on guard against one another the first thing that reason suggests is to seek peace , but that where peace can not be had , to use all of the advantages of war hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things the sovereign has twelve principal rights : hobbes , leviathan , xviii because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from social contract , the sovereign can not possibly breach the covenant ; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign therefore , the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse , who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes , and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published to prescribe the rules of civil law and property there are three ( monarchy , aristocracy and democracy ) : and only three ; since unlike aristotle he does not sub-divide them into '' good '' and '' deviant '' : and monarchy is the best , on practical grounds : in leviathan , hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so , he invites discord hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable hobbes rejected the idea of incorporeal substances and subsequently argued that even god himself was a corporeal substance '' however , hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary : if '' they tend to disorder in government , as countenancing rebellion or sedition ? then let them be silenced , and the teachers punished '' – but only by the civil authority the english and latin texts , oxford university press , 2012 ( clarendon edition of the works of thomas hobbes ) reprint from the 1651 edition full text online at oregonstate.edu a reduced version of leviathan at earlymoderntexts.com scan of 1651 edition

the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death after lengthy discussion with thomas hobbes , the parisian abraham bosse created the etching for the book 's famous frontispiece in the géometrique style which bosse himself had refined in it , a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape , clutching a sword and a crosier , beneath a quote from the book of job— '' non est potestas super terram quae comparetur ei the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual 's appetites and desires , while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the summum bonum , or greatest good , as previous thought had done consequently , any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them since there is no summum bonum , the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good given human nature , the variability of human desires , and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires , the state of nature , as hobbes calls this anarchic condition , must be a war of all against all it suggests a number of natural law , although hobbes is quick to point out that they can not properly speaking be called '' laws , '' since there is no one to enforce them hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things hobbes , leviathan , xiii.13 the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things hobbes concludes part one by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from social contract , the sovereign can not possibly breach the covenant ; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign the sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule ; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign 's actions in item 6 hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order there are three ( monarchy , aristocracy and democracy ) : and only three ; since unlike aristotle he does not sub-divide them into '' good '' and '' deviant '' : and monarchy is the best , on practical grounds : however , the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch : but , it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed : however , the answer is : and this means : note that ( perhaps rather radically ) this does not have to be any blood relative : however , practically this means : in leviathan , hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so , he invites discord hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable hobbes ' materialistic presuppositions also led him to hold a view which was considered highly controversial at the time in part iii hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a christian commonwealth behemoth by thomas hobbes classical republicanism john locke scientia potentia est hobbes 's moral and political philosophy leviathan – contemporary responses to the political theory of thomas hobbes bristol : thoemmes press , 1995 reprint from the 1651 edition full text online at oregonstate.edu a reduced version of leviathan at earlymoderntexts.com scan of 1651 edition

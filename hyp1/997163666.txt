the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death ( due to disagreements over the precise location of the chapters and verses when they were divided in the late middle ages , the verse hobbes quotes is usually given as job 41:33 in modern christian translations into english , job 41:25 in the masoretic text , septuagint , and the luther bible ; it is job 41:24 in the vulgate ) the torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons , in the style of giuseppe arcimboldo ; all are facing away from the viewer , with just the giant 's head having visible facial features ( a manuscript of leviathan created for charles ii in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces , all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right each side element reflects the equivalent power – castle to church , crown to mitre , cannon to excommunication , weapons to logic , and the battlefield to the religious courts the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual 's appetites and desires , while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object he suggests that the dominant political theology of the time , scholasticism , thrives on confused definitions of everyday words , such as incorporeal substance , which for hobbes is a contradiction in terms consequently , any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them since there is no summum bonum , the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good the desire to avoid the state of nature , as the place where the summum malum of violent death is most likely to occur , forms the polestar of political reasoning it suggests a number of natural law , although hobbes is quick to point out that they can not properly speaking be called '' laws , '' since there is no one to enforce them hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things hobbes concludes part one by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign the sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule ; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign 's actions because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace , and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord in item 6 hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign ( when that was re-established : again , leviathan was written during the civil war ) as to whether his theory was acceptable hobbes also touched upon the sovereign 's ability to tax in leviathan , although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories the need ( as hobbes saw it ) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war , and to quash the pope of rome 's challenge , to which hobbes devotes an extensive section hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of catholicism : '' now for the worship of saints , and icons , and relics , and other things at this day practiced in the church of rome , i say they are not allowed by the word of god '' the english and latin texts , oxford university press , 2012 ( clarendon edition of the works of thomas hobbes ) leviathan – contemporary responses to the political theory of thomas hobbes bristol : thoemmes press , 1995 hobbes and the law of nature , princeton : princeton university press , 2009

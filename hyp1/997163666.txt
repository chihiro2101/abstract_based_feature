the title of hobbes 's treatise alludes to the leviathan mentioned in the book of job in contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy , such as john locke 's two treatises of government or hobbes 's own earlier work the elements of law , hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise lexicography in the early modern period believed that the term '' leviathan '' was associated with the hebrew words lavah , meaning '' to couple , connect , or join '' , and thannin , meaning '' a serpent or dragon '' '' samuel mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to hobbes 's understanding of political force since both '' leviathan and hobbes 's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals ; they are omnipotent ; they can not be destroyed or divided ; they inspire fear in men ; they do not make pacts with men ; theirs is the dominion of power '' on pain of death after lengthy discussion with thomas hobbes , the parisian abraham bosse created the etching for the book 's famous frontispiece in the géometrique style which bosse himself had refined ) the torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons , in the style of giuseppe arcimboldo ; all are facing away from the viewer , with just the giant 's head having visible facial features ( a manuscript of leviathan created for charles ii in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces , all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions the two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right the giant holds the symbols of both sides , reflecting the union of secular , and spiritual in the sovereign , but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual 's appetites and desires , while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object he suggests that the dominant political theology of the time , scholasticism , thrives on confused definitions of everyday words , such as incorporeal substance , which for hobbes is a contradiction in terms hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the summum bonum , or greatest good , as previous thought had done given human nature , the variability of human desires , and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires , the state of nature , as hobbes calls this anarchic condition , must be a war of all against all hobbes , leviathan , xiv.4 hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust , and every man must be considered to have a right to all things the second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one 's right to all things where others are willing to do the same , to quit the state of nature , and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign : hence the sovereign can not injure any of his subjects and can not be accused of injustice because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace , and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord therefore , the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse , who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes , and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published to make war powers as he sees fit and to command the army in item 6 hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order there are three ( monarchy , aristocracy and democracy ) : and only three ; since unlike aristotle he does not sub-divide them into '' good '' and '' deviant '' : and monarchy is the best , on practical grounds : the right of succession always lies with the sovereign hobbes rejected the idea of incorporeal substances and subsequently argued that even god himself was a corporeal substance hobbes also touched upon the sovereign 's ability to tax in leviathan , although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories to hobbes , '' it is manifest that none can know they are god 's word ( though all true christians believe it ) but those to whom god himself hath revealed it supernaturally '' hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the kingdom of god can be found in the church , thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign behemoth by thomas hobbes classical republicanism john locke scientia potentia est hobbes 's moral and political philosophy the leviathan in the state theory of thomas hobbes – meaning and failure of a political symbol , chicago : the university of chicago press , 2008 ( earlier : greenwood press , 1996 )

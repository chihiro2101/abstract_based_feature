a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers a pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound pound locks were first used in china during the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ad ) , having been pioneered by the song politician and naval engineer qiao weiyue in 984 the water level could differ by or at each lock and in the grand canal the level was raised in this way by in medieval europe a sort of pound lock was built in 1373 at vreeswijk , netherlands 1410–1475 ) constructed 18 pound locks on the naviglio di bereguardo ( part of the milan canal system sponsored by francesco sforza ) between 1452 and 1458 when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle in large scale river navigation improvements , weirs and locks are used together a river improved by these means is often called a waterway or river navigation ( see example calder and hebble navigation ) sometimes a river is made entirely non-tidal by constructing a sea lock directly into the estuary the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways a more recent example is the rhine–main–danube canal with 13 saving locks out of a total of 16 locks since the box is '' wet '' ( filled with water ) , archimedes ' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same , regardless of the size of boat being carried ( or even if it contains only water ) the motive power may be steam or hydraulic , or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway there are no working waterway inclined planes in the uk at the moment , but the remains of a famous one can be seen at foxton in leicestershire on the leicester arm of the grand union canal visitors can now take a boat trip on the wheel and be lifted over in a few minutes compared to the time it took when the original lock staircase operated the victorian anderton boat lift , the world 's first vertical boat lift , linking the trent and mersey canal and the river weaver in cheshire , was reopened in 2002 another derivative is the peterborough lift lock which is a boat lift located on the trent canal in the city of peterborough , ontario , canada and is lock 21 on the trent-severn waterway as the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn , for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water it differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber canal pound canal safety gates sluice water slope control lock

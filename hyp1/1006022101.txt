a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers a pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound in contrast , an earlier design with a single gate was known as a flash lock pound locks were first used in china during the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ad ) , having been pioneered by the song politician and naval engineer qiao weiyue in 984 and fully described in the twenty-four histories song shi ( compiled in 1345 ) : needham , volume 4 , part 3 , 351 the water level could differ by or at each lock and in the grand canal the level was raised in this way by in medieval europe a sort of pound lock was built in 1373 at vreeswijk , netherlands yet the first true pound lock was built in 1396 at damme near bruges , belgium when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways due to the use of 10 water saving basins , only 10,500 m 3 of water are used the droitwich canal , reopened in 2011 , has a flight of three locks at hanbury which all have operational side ponds since the box is '' wet '' ( filled with water ) , archimedes ' principle ensures that the caisson always weighs the same , regardless of the size of boat being carried ( or even if it contains only water ) there are no working waterway inclined planes in the uk at the moment , but the remains of a famous one can be seen at foxton in leicestershire on the leicester arm of the grand union canal a marine railway is similar to a canal inclined plane in that it moves boats up or down a slope on rails the boat is secured to the cradle , possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics , and the cradle is hauled out of the water and up the hill with a cable the victorian anderton boat lift , the world 's first vertical boat lift , linking the trent and mersey canal and the river weaver in cheshire , was reopened in 2002 the world 's highest boat lift in strépy-thieu in belgium raises or lowers 1,350 tonnes boats by 73.15 metres when the box was at the bottom of the chamber , it was under almost of water – at a pressure of three atmospheres , in total it differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber canal pound canal safety gates sluice water slope control lock

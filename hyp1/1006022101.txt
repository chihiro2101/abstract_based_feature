a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers a pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound in contrast , an earlier design with a single gate was known as a flash lock the gates were 'hanging gates ' ; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached , and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out the water level could differ by or at each lock and in the grand canal the level was raised in this way by 1410–1475 ) constructed 18 pound locks on the naviglio di bereguardo ( part of the milan canal system sponsored by francesco sforza ) between 1452 and 1458 a weir will increase the depth of a shallow stretch , and the required lock will either be built in a gap in the weir , or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow stretch of river below it a river improved by these means is often called a waterway or river navigation ( see example calder and hebble navigation ) the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways due to the use of 10 water saving basins , only 10,500 m 3 of water are used a more recent example is the rhine–main–danube canal with 13 saving locks out of a total of 16 locks the droitwich canal , reopened in 2011 , has a flight of three locks at hanbury which all have operational side ponds side ponds were also installed on the grand union canal and the coventry canal , among others on some flights of locks with short intermediate pounds , the pounds are extended sideways – in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry ( in case , for instance , the lock below leaks more than the lock above ) an inclined plane consists of a cradle ( to hold a barge ) or caisson ( a box full of water in which a barge can float ) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other one of these '' locks '' was built and demonstrated to the prince regent ( later george iv ) , but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the coal canal in about 1817 the regents canal built one of these locks at the site of the present-day camden lock , north london shaft locks consist of a deep shaft with conventional upper gates as the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn , for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water the '' diagonal lock advisory group '' has identified several sites in britain where the new design could be installed , either on new waterways or canals under restoration canal pound canal safety gates sluice water slope control lock

a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers a pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound in contrast , an earlier design with a single gate was known as a flash lock pound locks were first used in china during the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ad ) , having been pioneered by the song politician and naval engineer qiao weiyue in 984 the distance between the two locks was rather more than 50 paces , and the whole space was covered with a great roof like a shed the gates were 'hanging gates ' ; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached , and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out the water level could differ by or at each lock and in the grand canal the level was raised in this way by yet the first true pound lock was built in 1396 at damme near bruges , belgium 1410–1475 ) constructed 18 pound locks on the naviglio di bereguardo ( part of the milan canal system sponsored by francesco sforza ) between 1452 and 1458 when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle in large scale river navigation improvements , weirs and locks are used together a river improved by these means is often called a waterway or river navigation ( see example calder and hebble navigation ) sometimes a river is made entirely non-tidal by constructing a sea lock directly into the estuary the longer the cut , the greater the difference in river level between start and end of the cut , so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways due to the use of 10 water saving basins , only 10,500 m 3 of water are used a more recent example is the rhine–main–danube canal with 13 saving locks out of a total of 16 locks one of these '' locks '' was built and demonstrated to the prince regent ( later george iv ) , but it had various engineering problems and the design was not put into use on the coal canal looking superficially similar to the caisson lock is the shaft lock as the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn , for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water the '' diagonal lock advisory group '' has identified several sites in britain where the new design could be installed , either on new waterways or canals under restoration canal pound canal safety gates sluice water slope control lock

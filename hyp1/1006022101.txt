a pound lock is a type of lock that is used almost exclusively nowadays on canals and rivers a pound lock has a chamber with gates at both ends that control the level of water in the pound pound locks were first used in china during the song dynasty ( 960–1279 ad ) , having been pioneered by the song politician and naval engineer qiao weiyue in 984 the gates were 'hanging gates ' ; when they were closed the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached , and then when the time came it was allowed to flow out the water level could differ by or at each lock and in the grand canal the level was raised in this way by this pound lock serviced many ships at once in a large basin yet the first true pound lock was built in 1396 at damme near bruges , belgium 1410–1475 ) constructed 18 pound locks on the naviglio di bereguardo ( part of the milan canal system sponsored by francesco sforza ) between 1452 and 1458 when a stretch of river is made navigable , a lock is sometimes required to bypass an obstruction such as a rapid , dam , or mill weir – because of the change in river level across the obstacle sometimes a river is made entirely non-tidal by constructing a sea lock directly into the estuary however , locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions , and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways . : de : sparschleuse die funktionsweise einer sparschleuse for example , the hindenburg-lock ( in hanover , germany , built 1919–1928 ) has two lock chambers of 225 m length , each of which would use 42,000 m 3 of water for a full locking cycle due to the use of 10 water saving basins , only 10,500 m 3 of water are used the droitwich canal , reopened in 2011 , has a flight of three locks at hanbury which all have operational side ponds side ponds were also installed on the grand union canal and the coventry canal , among others an inclined plane consists of a cradle ( to hold a barge ) or caisson ( a box full of water in which a barge can float ) which moves on rails sideways up a slope from one waterway to the other the motive power may be steam or hydraulic , or may come from overbalancing the top caisson with extra water from the upper waterway where there is a steep rise in the land a marine railway may be more effective than multiple locks , such as on the elbląg canal as the lock is emptied water is run into each chamber in turn , for filling the water is released from the chambers thus saving the waste of a complete lockfull of water the bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door , but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top , installed a boat 's length from the far wall of the tube it differs from the similar caisson lock design in that the boat does not have to be carried in a submerged chamber canal pound canal safety gates sluice water slope control lock

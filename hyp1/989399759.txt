the first link-state routing concept was published in 1979 by john m , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included the technique was later adapted for use in the contemporary link-state routing protocols is-is and ospf cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol ( eigrp ) as a '' hybrid '' protocol , despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps however , it does synchronize routing tables at start up as ospf does , and sends specific updates only when topology changes occur in 2004 , radia perlman proposed using link-state routing for layer 2 frame forwarding with devices called routing bridges or rbridges more recently , this hierarchical technique was applied to wireless mesh networks using the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) this is used in some routing protocols that use radio frequency transmission as previously mentioned , the first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node identifies all the other nodes ( either routers or networks ) to which it is directly connected when a link-state advertisement is received at a node , the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message : if this message is newer ( i.e this procedure rapidly gets a copy of the latest version of each node 's link-state advertisement to every node in the network finally , with the complete set of link-state advertisements ( one from each node in the network ) in hand , each node produces the graph for the map of the network for any given destination node , the best path for that destination is the node which is the first step from the root node , down the branch in the shortest-path tree which leads toward the desired destination node these are situations in which , in the simplest form , two neighboring nodes each think the other is the best path to a given destination if two nodes start with different maps , it is possible to have scenarios in which routing loops are created the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks ( which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks ) mprs makes olsr unique from other link state routing protocols

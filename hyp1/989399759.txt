rosen , arpanet routing algorithm improvements , bbn report no , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included the technique was later adapted for use in the contemporary link-state routing protocols is-is and ospf , one with no areas , so that all nodes have a map of the entire network as previously mentioned , the first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node next , each node periodically ( and in case of connectivity changes ) sends a short message , the link-state advertisement , which : identifies the node which is producing it this message is sent to all the nodes on a network as a necessary precursor , each node in the network remembers , for every one of its neighbors , the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node when a link-state advertisement is received at a node , the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message : if this message is newer ( i.e this procedure rapidly gets a copy of the latest version of each node 's link-state advertisement to every node in the network the link-state message giving information about the neighbors is recomputed , and then flooded throughout the network , whenever there is a change in the connectivity between the node and its neighbors ; e.g each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network ; generally some variant of dijkstra 's algorithm is used the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree for any given destination node , the best path for that destination is the node which is the first step from the root node , down the branch in the shortest-path tree which leads toward the desired destination node to create the routing table , it is only necessary to walk the tree , remembering the identity of the node at the head of each branch , and filling in the routing table entry for each node one comes across with that identity if two nodes start with different maps , it is possible to have scenarios in which routing loops are created the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks ( which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks ) mprs makes olsr unique from other link state routing protocols

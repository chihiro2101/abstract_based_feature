the first link-state routing concept was published in 1979 by john m mcquillan ( then at bolt , beranek and newman ) as a mechanism that would calculate routes more quickly when network conditions changed , and thus lead to more stable routing & nbsp ; 711â€“719 , 1980 later work at bbn technologies showed how to use the link-state technique in a hierarchical system ( i.e the technique was later adapted for use in the contemporary link-state routing protocols is-is and ospf this is used in some routing protocols that use radio frequency transmission , one with no areas , so that all nodes have a map of the entire network as previously mentioned , the first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node when a link-state advertisement is received at a node , the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message : if this message is newer ( i.e , has a higher sequence number ) , it is saved , the sequence number is updated , and a copy is sent in turn to each of that node 's neighbors finally , with the complete set of link-state advertisements ( one from each node in the network ) in hand , each node produces the graph for the map of the network the algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements ; for each one , it makes links on the map of the network , from the node which sent that message , to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network ; generally some variant of dijkstra 's algorithm is used the algorithm starts with both structures empty ; it then adds to the first one the node itself the candidate node which is closest to any of the nodes already in the tree is itself moved into the tree and attached to the appropriate neighbor node the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree this can occur since each node computes its shortest-path tree and its routing table without interacting in any way with any other nodes the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks ( which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks ) mprs makes olsr unique from other link state routing protocols

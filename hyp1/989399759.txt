what is believed to be the first adaptive routing network of computers , using link-state routing as its heart , was designed and implemented during 1976-77 by a team from plessey radar led by bernard j harris ; the project was for '' wavell '' - a system of computer command and control for the british army , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included the technique was later adapted for use in the contemporary link-state routing protocols is-is and ospf cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol ( eigrp ) as a '' hybrid '' protocol , despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps more recently , this hierarchical technique was applied to wireless mesh networks using the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) next , each node periodically ( and in case of connectivity changes ) sends a short message , the link-state advertisement , which : identifies the node which is producing it as a necessary precursor , each node in the network remembers , for every one of its neighbors , the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node when a link-state advertisement is received at a node , the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message : if this message is newer ( i.e , has a higher sequence number ) , it is saved , the sequence number is updated , and a copy is sent in turn to each of that node 's neighbors this procedure rapidly gets a copy of the latest version of each node 's link-state advertisement to every node in the network the algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements ; for each one , it makes links on the map of the network , from the node which sent that message , to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node any such change will be detected by the reachability protocol which each node runs with its neighbors the variant of a greedy algorithm then repetitively does the following : all neighbour nodes which are directly connected to the node are just added to the tree ( excepting any nodes which are already in either the tree or the candidate list ) the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree to create the routing table , it is only necessary to walk the tree , remembering the identity of the node at the head of each branch , and filling in the routing table entry for each node one comes across with that identity the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks ( which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks ) rfc 3626 olsr is proactive , it uses hello and topology control ( tc ) messages to discover and disseminate link state information into the mobile ad hoc network individual nodes use the topology information to compute next hop paths regard to all nodes in the network using shortest hop forwarding paths

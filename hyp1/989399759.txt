what is believed to be the first adaptive routing network of computers , using link-state routing as its heart , was designed and implemented during 1976-77 by a team from plessey radar led by bernard j harris ; the project was for '' wavell '' - a system of computer command and control for the british army the first link-state routing concept was published in 1979 by john m mcquillan ( then at bolt , beranek and newman ) as a mechanism that would calculate routes more quickly when network conditions changed , and thus lead to more stable routing rosen , the new routing algorithm for the arpanet , ieee trans , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol ( eigrp ) as a '' hybrid '' protocol , despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps in 2004 , radia perlman proposed using link-state routing for layer 2 frame forwarding with devices called routing bridges or rbridges more recently , this hierarchical technique was applied to wireless mesh networks using the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) as previously mentioned , the first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node next , each node periodically ( and in case of connectivity changes ) sends a short message , the link-state advertisement , which : identifies the node which is producing it includes a 'sequence number ' , which increases every time the source node makes up a new version of the message when a link-state advertisement is received at a node , the node looks up the sequence number it has stored for the source of that link-state message : if this message is newer ( i.e finally , with the complete set of link-state advertisements ( one from each node in the network ) in hand , each node produces the graph for the map of the network the algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements ; for each one , it makes links on the map of the network , from the node which sent that message , to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node the link-state message giving information about the neighbors is recomputed , and then flooded throughout the network , whenever there is a change in the connectivity between the node and its neighbors ; e.g the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree for any given destination node , the best path for that destination is the node which is the first step from the root node , down the branch in the shortest-path tree which leads toward the desired destination node the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks ( which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks )

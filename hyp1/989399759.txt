the first link-state routing concept was published in 1979 by john m mcquillan ( then at bolt , beranek and newman ) as a mechanism that would calculate routes more quickly when network conditions changed , and thus lead to more stable routing rosen , arpanet routing algorithm improvements , bbn report no , one in which the network was divided into areas ) so that each switching node does not need a map of the entire network , only the area ( s ) in which it is included the technique was later adapted for use in the contemporary link-state routing protocols is-is and ospf cisco literature refers to enhanced interior gateway routing protocol ( eigrp ) as a '' hybrid '' protocol , despite the fact it distributes routing tables instead of topology maps in 2004 , radia perlman proposed using link-state routing for layer 2 frame forwarding with devices called routing bridges or rbridges more recently , this hierarchical technique was applied to wireless mesh networks using the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) as previously mentioned , the first main stage in the link-state algorithm is to give a map of the network to every node next , each node periodically ( and in case of connectivity changes ) sends a short message , the link-state advertisement , which : identifies the node which is producing it as a necessary precursor , each node in the network remembers , for every one of its neighbors , the sequence number of the last link-state message which it received from that node finally , with the complete set of link-state advertisements ( one from each node in the network ) in hand , each node produces the graph for the map of the network the algorithm iterates over the collection of link-state advertisements ; for each one , it makes links on the map of the network , from the node which sent that message , to all the nodes which that message indicates are neighbors of the sending node each node independently runs an algorithm over the map to determine the shortest path from itself to every other node in the network ; generally some variant of dijkstra 's algorithm is used the shortest path from that node to any other node is indicated by the list of nodes one traverses to get from the root of the tree , to the desired node in the tree to create the routing table , it is only necessary to walk the tree , remembering the identity of the node at the head of each branch , and filling in the routing table entry for each node one comes across with that identity . the optimized link state routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks the optimized link state routing protocol ( olsr ) is a link-state routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks ( which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks )

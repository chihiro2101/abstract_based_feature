with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches prehistoric people used primitive oil lamps to illuminate surroundings these lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as rocks , shells , horns and stones , were filled with grease , and had a fiber wick hundreds of these lamps ( hollow worked stones ) have been found in the lascaux caves in modern-day france , dating to about 15,000 years ago the use of whale oil declined after abraham gesner , a canadian geologist , first refined kerosene in the 1840s , allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost in the 1850s , the price of whale oil dramatically increased ( more than doubling from 1848 to 1856 ) due to shortages of available whales , hastening whale oil 's decline gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s , and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people the gas mantle boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lanterns the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electricity in the form of arc lamp for large space and street lighting , followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting segmented sleep patterns disappeared , improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night , and more street lights reduced urban crime lighting fixtures come in a wide variety of styles for various functions the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare nearly any material can be used , so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvins ; daylight is around 6400 kelvins lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture task lighting is mainly functional and is usually the most concentrated , for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials general lighting ( sometimes referred to as ambient light ) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area downlighting is most common , with fixtures on or recessed in the ceiling casting light downward although it is easy to design , it has dramatic problems with glare and excess energy consumption due to large number of fittings uplighting is less common , often used to bounce indirect light off the ceiling and back down uplighting ( indirect ) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces however indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface lighting from the side is the less common , as it tends to produce glare near eye level forms of lighting include alcove lighting , which like most other uplighting is indirect this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light soffit or close to wall lighting can be general or a decorative wall-wash , sometimes used to bring out texture ( like stucco or plaster ) on a wall , though this may also show its defects as well there are also downlights with internal reflectors designed to accept common ' a ' lamps ( light bulbs ) which are generally less costly than reflector lamps track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall a modified version of this is cable lighting , where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension this would probably fall under accent lighting , though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting in a movie theater , steps in the aisles are usually marked with a row of small lights for convenience and safety , when the film has started and the other lights are off street light are used to light roadways and walkways at night sometimes security lighting can be used along roadways in urban areas , or behind homes or commercial facilities underwater accent lighting is also used for koi ponds , fountains , swimming pools and the like spectral effects of led forward lighting white rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle 's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear , warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards , or about to do so in the late 1950s , some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars ' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements while lamps have traditionally been rated and marketed primarily in terms of their power consumption , expressed in watts , proliferation of lighting technology beyond the incandescent light bulb has eliminated the correspondence of wattage to the amount of light produced for example , a 60 & nbsp ; w incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 & nbsp ; w compact fluorescent lamp neon : a low pressure gas contained within a glass tube ; the color emitted depends on the gas light emitting diodes : light emitting diodes ( led ) are solid state devices that emit light by dint of the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material comparative study of energy saving light sources for example , dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite the setup of stage lighting is tailored for each scene of each production a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance ; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat the human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum , therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light the basic si unit of measurement is the candela ( cd ) , which describes the luminous intensity , all other photometric units are derived from the candela it describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area , and falls within a given solid angle gai represents the relative separation of object colors illuminated by a light source ; the greater the gai , the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors this is the first device created to accurately measure and characterize light ( intensity , spectrum , timing , and duration ) entering the eye that affects the human body 's clock in many situations , controlling the light emission of leds may be done most effectively by using the principles of nonimaging optics analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used those fully independent designers who meet the requirements for professional membership in the association typically append the abbreviation iald to their name the professional lighting designers association ( plda ) , formerly known as elda is an organisation focusing on the promotion of the profession of architectural lighting design list of environmental health hazards list of light sources timeline of lighting technology

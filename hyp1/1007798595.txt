with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches these lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as rocks , shells , horns and stones , were filled with grease , and had a fiber wick hundreds of these lamps ( hollow worked stones ) have been found in the lascaux caves in modern-day france , dating to about 15,000 years ago oily animals ( birds and fish ) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick firefly have been used as lighting sources a major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil by 1860 , there were 33 kerosene plants in the united states , and americans spent more on gas and kerosene than on whale oil gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s , and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electricity in the form of arc lamp for large space and street lighting , followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting the first form of electric light history of the carbon arc lamp ( 1800 - 1980s ) '.edison tech center , edisontechcenter.org over time , electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries segmented sleep patterns disappeared , improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night , and more street lights reduced urban crime the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare nearly any material can be used , so long as it can tolerate the excess heat and is in keeping with safety codes shadow the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvins ; daylight is around 6400 kelvins lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture accent lighting is mainly decorative , intended to highlight pictures , plants , or other elements of interior design or landscaping indoors , this would be a basic lamp on a table or floor , or a fixture on the ceiling outdoors , general lighting for a parking lot may be as low as 10-20 lux ( 1-2 footcandles ) since pedestrians and motorists already used to the dark will need little light for crossing the area however indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface front lighting is also quite common , but tends to make the subject look flat as its casts almost no visible shadows lighting from the side is the less common , as it tends to produce glare near eye level forms of lighting include alcove lighting , which like most other uplighting is indirect this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light the effect depends heavily on the exact type of lighting source used track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall a modified version of this is cable lighting , where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension it is typically a floor lamp but may be wall-mounted like a sconce further interior light fixtures include chandeliers , pendant lights , ceiling fans with lights , close-to-ceiling or flush lights , and various types of lamps the portable or table lamp is probably the most common fixture , found in many homes and offices the standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting , while the desk lamp is considered task lighting magnifier lamps are also task lighting field test delta : post-top photovoltaic pathway luminaire found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 nlpip lighting answers : photovoltaic lighting found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 floodlights can be used to illuminate work zones or outdoor playing fields during nighttime hours sometimes security lighting can be used along roadways in urban areas , or behind homes or commercial facilities these are extremely bright lights used to deter crime entry lights can be used outside to illuminate and signal the entrance to a property delta snapshot : outdoor entry lighting headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle , designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible van derlofske , j , jd bullough , j watkinson commonly called 'light bulbs ' , lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture , which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation for example , a 60 & nbsp ; w incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 & nbsp ; w compact fluorescent lamp each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light lamp types include : ballast : a ballast is an auxiliary piece of equipment designed to start and properly control the flow of power to discharge light sources such as fluorescent and metal-halide lamp ( hid ) lamps neon : a low pressure gas contained within a glass tube ; the color emitted depends on the gas light emitting diodes : light emitting diodes ( led ) are solid state devices that emit light by dint of the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material compact fluorescent lamps : cfls are designed to replace incandescent lamps in existing and new installations lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required , occupants of the structure , energy efficiency , and cost artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in a space by using daylight factor calculations for example , dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite other reflective surfaces also have an effect on lighting design stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source , along with the colors that can be rendered by this light for a given light output , cfls use between one fifth and one quarter the power of an equivalent incandescent lamp while the initially cost of leds is still higher then incandescent lamps , the savings are so dramatic that there are very few instances that leds aren â€™ t the most economical choice conflated data , aggregated in the early 2000s , about the increased use of blue-white leds seemed to indicate that their use , while saving energy , may compromise human health the international association of lighting designers ( iald ) is an organization which focuses on the advancement of lighting design education and the recognition of independent professional lighting designers

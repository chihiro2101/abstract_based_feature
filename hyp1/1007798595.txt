with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches these lamps were made from naturally occurring materials such as rocks , shells , horns and stones , were filled with grease , and had a fiber wick firefly have been used as lighting sources a major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil the use of whale oil declined after abraham gesner , a canadian geologist , first refined kerosene in the 1840s , allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost the gas mantle boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lanterns the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electricity in the form of arc lamp for large space and street lighting , followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting the first form of electric light history of the carbon arc lamp ( 1800 - 1980s ) '.edison tech center , edisontechcenter.org over time , electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries segmented sleep patterns disappeared , improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night , and more street lights reduced urban crime the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings the more transparent the lighting fixtures are , the higher efficacy color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture general lighting ( sometimes referred to as ambient light ) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area 90 % when compared to a halogen downlight or spotlight led lamps or bulbs are now available to retro fit in place of high energy consumption lamps it is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels it gives a more uniform presentation of the light output in operation however indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface while indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free light effect it can be regarded as an uneconomical lighting principle lighting from the side is the less common , as it tends to produce glare near eye level forms of lighting include alcove lighting , which like most other uplighting is indirect this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light soffit or close to wall lighting can be general or a decorative wall-wash , sometimes used to bring out texture ( like stucco or plaster ) on a wall , though this may also show its defects as well the effect depends heavily on the exact type of lighting source used there are also downlights with internal reflectors designed to accept common ' a ' lamps ( light bulbs ) which are generally less costly than reflector lamps track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall a modified version of this is cable lighting , where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension the standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting , while the desk lamp is considered task lighting in a movie theater , steps in the aisles are usually marked with a row of small lights for convenience and safety , when the film has started and the other lights are off street light are used to light roadways and walkways at night online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 field test delta snapshot : led street lighting found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 floodlights can be used to illuminate work zones or outdoor playing fields during nighttime hours beacon lights are positioned at the intersection of two roads to aid in navigation underwater accent lighting is also used for koi ponds , fountains , swimming pools and the like spectral effects of led forward lighting found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle 's direction of travel to following drivers flashing turn signals on the front , side , and rear of the vehicle indicate an intended change of position or direction commonly called 'light bulbs ' , lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture , which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light visible light output is typically measured in lumens this unit only quantifies the visible radiation , and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light fluorescent light : a tube coated with phosphor containing low pressure mercury vapor that produces white light neon : a low pressure gas contained within a glass tube ; the color emitted depends on the gas light emitting diodes : light emitting diodes ( led ) are solid state devices that emit light by dint of the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as 'architectural lighting design ' artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in a space by using daylight factor calculations in some instances , the materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre , dance , or musical performance , and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics especially in the early days of these industries , very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source , along with the colors that can be rendered by this light the amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen ( lm ) assist recommends : recommendations for specifying color properties of light sources for retail merchandising lighting control systems reduce energy usage and cost by helping to provide light only when and where it is needed in many situations , controlling the light emission of leds may be done most effectively by using the principles of nonimaging optics analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used

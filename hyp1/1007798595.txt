with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches prehistoric people used primitive oil lamps to illuminate surroundings lamps typically used animal or vegetable fats as fuel oily animals ( birds and fish ) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick firefly have been used as lighting sources candles and glass and pottery lamps were also invented chandeliers were an early form of '' light fixture '' a major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s , and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people the gas mantle boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lanterns the next major drop in price came about in the 1880s with the introduction of electricity in the form of arc lamp for large space and street lighting , followed by incandescent light bulb-based utilities for indoor and outdoor lighting the first form of electric light history of the carbon arc lamp ( 1800 - 1980s ) '.edison tech center , edisontechcenter.org over time , electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings shadow the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance for critical inspection or color matching tasks , or for retail displays of food and clothing , the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture downlighting is most common , with fixtures on or recessed in the ceiling casting light downward although it is easy to design , it has dramatic problems with glare and excess energy consumption due to large number of fittings uplighting is less common , often used to bounce indirect light off the ceiling and back down while indirect lighting can create a diffused and shadow free light effect it can be regarded as an uneconomical lighting principle others use it to achieve a more dramatic effect this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light the effect depends heavily on the exact type of lighting source used recessed lighting ( often called '' pot lights '' in canada , '' can lights '' or 'high hats '' in the us ) is popular , with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it downlights can be incandescent , fluorescent , high-intensity discharge lamp or led a master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts , instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer a modified version of this is cable lighting , where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension other forms include neon , which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else , but to actually be an artwork in itself this would probably fall under accent lighting , though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting some manufacturers are designing led and photovoltaic luminaires to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional street light fixtures found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 nlpip lighting answers : photovoltaic lighting security lights may include floodlights and be activated with pir switches that detect moving heat sources in darkness delta snapshot : outdoor entry lighting found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 these lights are installed for safety , security , and for decoration underwater accent lighting is also used for koi ponds , fountains , swimming pools and the like headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle , designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 tail and brake lights are red and emit light to the rear so as to reveal the vehicle 's direction of travel to following drivers commonly called 'light bulbs ' , lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture , which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation for example , a 60 & nbsp ; w incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 & nbsp ; w compact fluorescent lamp each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light visible light output is typically measured in lumens fluorescent light : a tube coated with phosphor containing low pressure mercury vapor that produces white light light emitting diodes : light emitting diodes ( led ) are solid state devices that emit light by dint of the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material compact fluorescent lamps : cfls are designed to replace incandescent lamps in existing and new installations comparative study of energy saving light sources lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as 'architectural lighting design ' artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in a space by using daylight factor calculations in some instances , the materials used on walls and furniture play a key role in the lighting effect for example , dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics especially in the early days of these industries , very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat the basic si unit of measurement is the candela ( cd ) , which describes the luminous intensity , all other photometric units are derived from the candela in order to specifically measure the amount of light entering the eye , personal circadian light meter called the daysimeter has been developed in response to daylighting technology , daylight harvesting systems have been developed to further reduce energy consumption analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used in their study , they found that both positive and negative human emotions are felt more intensely in bright light the international association of lighting designers ( iald ) is an organization which focuses on the advancement of lighting design education and the recognition of independent professional lighting designers

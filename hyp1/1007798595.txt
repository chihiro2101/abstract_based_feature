with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches prehistoric people used primitive oil lamps to illuminate surroundings hundreds of these lamps ( hollow worked stones ) have been found in the lascaux caves in modern-day france , dating to about 15,000 years ago oily animals ( birds and fish ) were also used as lamps after being threaded with a wick firefly have been used as lighting sources a major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil the use of whale oil declined after abraham gesner , a canadian geologist , first refined kerosene in the 1840s , allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost gas lighting was economical enough to power street lights in major cities starting in the early 1800s , and was also used in some commercial buildings and in the homes of wealthy people the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance for critical inspection or color matching tasks , or for retail displays of food and clothing , the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture task lighting is mainly functional and is usually the most concentrated , for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials general lighting ( sometimes referred to as ambient light ) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area outdoors , general lighting for a parking lot may be as low as 10-20 lux ( 1-2 footcandles ) since pedestrians and motorists already used to the dark will need little light for crossing the area downlighting is most common , with fixtures on or recessed in the ceiling casting light downward this tends to be the most used method , used in both offices and homes although it is easy to design , it has dramatic problems with glare and excess energy consumption due to large number of fittings uplighting is less common , often used to bounce indirect light off the ceiling and back down it is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels uplighting ( indirect ) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces however indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface backlighting either around or through an object is mainly for accent this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light recessed lighting ( often called '' pot lights '' in canada , '' can lights '' or 'high hats '' in the us ) is popular , with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it there are also downlights with internal reflectors designed to accept common ' a ' lamps ( light bulbs ) which are generally less costly than reflector lamps track lighting , invented by lightolier , was popular at one period of time because it was much easier to install than recessed lighting , and individual fixtures are decorative and can be easily aimed at a wall it has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks , which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have , and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves a modified version of this is cable lighting , where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension the standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting , while the desk lamp is considered task lighting magnifier lamps are also task lighting this uses diffuser panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights , and is considered general lighting traditionally made up of small low wattage , low-voltage lamps in a track or translucent tube , these are rapidly being replaced with led based versions street light are used to light roadways and walkways at night some manufacturers are designing led and photovoltaic luminaires to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional street light fixtures online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 field test delta snapshot : led street lighting volume 9 , issue 3 sometimes security lighting can be used along roadways in urban areas , or behind homes or commercial facilities found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 these lights are installed for safety , security , and for decoration headlamps are white or selective yellow lights placed in the front of the vehicle , designed to illuminate the upcoming road and to make the vehicle more visible for example , a 60 & nbsp ; w incandescent light bulb produces about the same amount of light as a 13 & nbsp ; w compact fluorescent lamp this unit only quantifies the visible radiation , and excludes invisible infrared and ultraviolet light lamp types include : ballast : a ballast is an auxiliary piece of equipment designed to start and properly control the flow of power to discharge light sources such as fluorescent and metal-halide lamp ( hid ) lamps halogen : incandescent lamps containing halogen gases such as iodine or bromine , increasing the efficacy of the lamp versus a plain incandescent lamp renewable & sustainable energy reviews serial online lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required , occupants of the structure , energy efficiency , and cost for simple installations , hand calculations based on tabular data are used to provide an acceptable lighting design lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre , dance , or musical performance , and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics dimmers , colored filters , reflectors , lenses , motorized or manually aimed lamps , and different kinds of flood and spot lights are among the tools used by a stage lighting designer to produce the desired effects a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance ; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat the human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum , therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light the amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen ( lm ) for example , a lighting level of 400 lux might be chosen for a work environment involving meeting rooms and conferences , whereas a level of 80 lux could be selected for building hallways analysis of lighting quality particularly emphasizes use of natural lighting , but also considers spectral content if artificial light is to be used by 2018 , production costs dropped , performance increased , and energy consumption was reduced polluting light is often wasted light involving unnecessary energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions the national council on qualifications for the lighting professions ( ncqlp ) offers the lighting certification examination which tests rudimentary lighting design principles list of environmental health hazards list of light sources timeline of lighting technology
